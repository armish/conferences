[{"Abstract":"<b>Objective: <\/b>To identify genetic and clinicopathological factors that affect the response of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), profile the genomic and transcriptomic alterations after nCRT and relate the alterations to patient&#8217;s prognosis.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A total of 137 samples from 57 ESCC patients undergoing nCRT were collected. 82 samples including 54 pre-treatment samples and 28 post-treatment samples were subjected to whole-exome sequencing, and 55 samples including 26 pre-treatment samples and 29 post-treatment samples were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. Genetic and clinicopathological factors associated with patient&#8217;s response to nCRT were identified by comparing baseline features of patients achieving pathological response (pCR) and patients not achieving pCR. Genomic and transcriptomic profiles before and after nCRT were compared to identify features acquired during nCRT and the association of identified features with patient&#8217;s recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were investigated.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Co-deficiency of DDR and HIPPO pathway at baseline synergistically sensitized ESCC to nCRT. The arachidonic acid metabolism pathway was upregulated at baseline in patients with pCR. The proportion of small deletion and insertion (INDEL %) significantly increased in acquired mutations (p&#60;0.001) and was positively correlated with focal chromosomal loss (Spearman's &#961;=0.52, p=0.005) and negatively correlated with broad chromosomal gain (Spearman's &#961;=-0.61, p&#60;0.001) after nCRT. Acquired INDEL% was associated with tumor regression grade (TRG) (p=0.06) and predicted the worse RFS (p=0.16) and OS (p=0.067). The degree of clonal expansion during nCRT was associated with patient&#8217;s RFS (p=0.0087) and OS (p=0.023), and negative correlated with acquired INDEL % (Spearman's &#961;=-0.45, p=0.02). The expression profile of tumor tissue was changed after nCRT and displayed upregulation of cell adhesion and stromal related pathways and downregulation of DNA replication and cell cycle pathways, and the alteration of expression profile was associated with patient&#8217;s prognosis.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>nCRT remodels the genome and transcriptome of ESCC. Small deletion\/insertion and focal chromosomal loss may be characteristic genomic alterations imposed by radiation. Acquired INDEL proportion is a biomarker to indicate the efficacy of nCRT and predict patient&#8217;s prognosis. The degree of clonal expansion during nCRT reflects the treatment resistance and associated with patient&#8217;s prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5805cec4-6c39-4bab-b72a-5611e3effedf\/@x03B8ZU2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-05 Radiation-induced gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy,Gene profiling,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18064"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yang Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>TingTing Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaojun Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xia Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wu'an Bao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danhong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Bao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junrong Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xue Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yang Shao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guoqin Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qixun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

There is great interest in the capacity to improve radiation response and to de-escalate dose through combination pharmacological strategies. Evaluating these methods is a persistent challenge to the field. The clonogenic assay has been the gold standard assay in radiobiology research to evaluate the ability of a single cell to grow into a colony after different radiation treatments. However, the assay is laborious, time consuming and sensitive to environmental conditions. Also, the low cell seeding density may pose challenges for cells to proliferate, and extra conditioned culture medium is required for certain cell lines. Here, we have used the Celigo imaging cytometer to track cell confluence growth day by day, to demonstrate its comparable ability with the clonogenic assay to reveal differences in cell proliferation ability after different radiation treatments.<br \/>Methods: Firstly, confluence measurement consistency was validated by repeatedly measuring the same wells for 6 times (Celigo 200 BFFL). Next, cell confluence growth tracking was compared with the clonogenic assay using 4 prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, 22Rv1, and LN95), after X-ray treatment and X-ray in combination with androgen receptor (AR)-inhibiting enzalutamide treatment. Treated cells were collected and seeded to 12-well plates followed by daily checks with Celigo. The Celigo imaging cytometer can image each well and conduct automatic image segmentation to calculate cell confluence reported as a percentage of well area. Daily cell confluence data was used to draw cell growth curves.<br \/>Results: The consistency of cell confluence measurements was validated with a coefficient of variation less than 5%. In comparing cell confluence growth with clonogenic assay, with the increase of X-ray dose (0Gy, 2Gy, and 4Gy), the degenerating cell proliferation ability was consistently observed in all 4 cell lines with both assays. Additionally, X-ray in combination with enzalutamide treated LNCaP cells demonstrated decreased cell proliferation ability than X-ray alone treated cells, as demonstrated by both cell confluence tracking and clonogenic assay. However, enzalutamide did not affect the proliferation ability of X-ray treated AR-negative PC3 cells, and was confirmed in both assays. The radiopotentiation effect of enzalutamide was also observed in AR-expressing 22Rv1 and LN95 cells with clonogenic assay, but not in 22Rv1 cells with cell confluence tracking.<br \/>Conclusion: Cell confluence tracking with Celigo allows daily in situ monitoring of cells and a higher cell seeding density than the clonogenic assay. It is able to provide additional evidence of cell proliferation to supplement the traditional clonogenic assay in radiobiology research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7a790712-a5e4-4f1a-bb8e-d93828303c94\/@x03B8ZU2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-07 Radiobiology research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell proliferation,Radiosensitization,Assay development,Radiation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18066"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wen Jiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>W.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether STING activation is involved in partial volume radiation therapy (RT).<br \/>Materials\/Methods: We investigated 67NR murine orthotopic breast tumors in Balb\/c mice and LLC cells injected in the flank of C<sub>57<\/sub>Bl\/<sub>6<\/sub>, cGAS, or STING KO mice. RT was delivered to 50% or 100% of the tumor volume using a 2X2 cm collimator on a microirradiator allowing precise irradiation. Tumors were collected at different time points post-RT and assessed for different measurements.<br \/>Results: We previously showed that a single dose of radiation delivered to half of the tumor (50% RT) activated an anti-tumor immune response comparable to the response in a fully-irradiated tumor in the immunogenic 67NR murine breast carcinoma tumor model and in the less immunogenic and more radioresistant Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor model. We have also demonstrated that this immune response was due to the infiltration of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells along with an increased expression of ICAM adhesion molecules. Treatment with either anti-CD8 or anti-ICAM antibodies abrogated the hemi-RT response. Furthermore, a significant abscopal effect was observed after partial irradiation with a single dose of 10Gy in a bilateral 67NR tumors model. In this study, we tested whether the hemi-irradiation-mediated immune response involves the cGAS\/STING canonical pathway, or a non-canonical activation of STING, in the 67NR or LLC tumor models. It has been reported that STING can be activated, independently of cGAS, <i>via<\/i> non-canonical activation of STING, involving ATM and TRAF6, among other factors. We found significant activation of the cGAS\/STING pathway in the hemi-irradiated tumors as compared to control and to 100% exposed 67NR tumors. Interestingly, the increased expression of the cGAS\/STING pathway was found in the hemi-irradiated tumor but, also in the non-irradiated part of this hemi-irradiated tumor. In the LLC model, a non-canonical activation of STING was involved. Using both cGAS and STING KO mice, we demonstrated that the partial exposure RT-mediated immune response is dependent on STING activation in the host while cGAS is dispensable.<br \/>Conclusions: Upstream pathways responsible for STING activation are tumor type-specific. Identifying the upstream pathways responsible for STING activation in the partial RT-mediated immune response in different tumor types would improve this therapy and its potential combination with immune checkpoint blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4209163d-23ad-422f-a40d-8430e58e2a51\/@x03B8ZU2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-04 Radiation-activated signaling pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Immune response,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18952"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mickael Mathieu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prerna R.

The highly invasive nature of the GSCs suggested a model system for evaluating the effects of specific brain microenvironments on glioma radioresponse and the potential for topographic heterogeneity in radioresistance. Subsequent analyses revealed that GSCs in the OB were significantly more radioresistant than those in the RH. Because the OB is highly enriched in neurons and given recent data suggesting that neuron\/glioma interactions drive GBM growth, in this study we first defined contact between GSCs and neurons in the OB and RH using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and confocal microscopy. In the OB 56% of tumor cells were in direct contact with neurons as compared to 24% of tumor cells in the RH. Moreover, among the tumor cells in contact with neurons 25% had 2 or more neuronal contacts in the OB versus 2% in the RH. These data suggest a significantly greater level of glioma-neurons interaction in the OB. To further investigate the OB as a radioresistant niche, RNAseq was used to define the transcriptome of NSC11 GSCs located in the OB versus the RH. Of the greater than 15,000 genes evaluated, 1887 genes were differentially expressed between the 2 sites: 872 upregulated and 1015 down regulated in the OB versus the RH. Functional analyses (IPA and GSEA) indicated that among the genes overexpressed in the OB GSCs were a group associated with the cell cycle, specifically mitosis and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Comparison of the SAC genes overexpressed in the OB with GBM clinical outcomes (TCGA) showed a significant correlation with decreased patient survival. These analyses suggested that cell cycle regulation may play a role in the radioresistance of OB GSCs. Accordingly, radiation-induced cell cycle redistribution of GSCs in the OB and the RH was determined by IHC analysis of cell cycle phase markers and flow cytometry (propidium iodide) performed on dissociated tumor cells. Results showed a significantly higher percentage of cells in G2 in the OB at 24h and 48h after 10Gy, suggestive of prolonged G2 arrest. In addition, analysis of radiation-induced DNA DSBs using &#947;H2AX and 53BP1 nuclear foci showed faster and more complete foci dispersal after 10Gy in the OB GSCs versus those in the RH, indicative of increased DSBs repair in the OB. These data suggest that GSC radioresistance in the OB is the result of a more effective DNA damage response. Moreover, results suggest that the murine OB may provide a model system for investigating GBM radioresistance as well as the potential role of glioma\/neuron interactions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e3f522cf-696a-41f9-a22a-4799897077bd\/@y03B8ZU3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Radioresistance,Microenvironment,Olfactory bulb,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18953"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Charlotte M.

Post-surgical radiation therapy (RT) is the only treatment that significantly improves survival of GBM patients but recurrence is inevitable. Elucidating the mechanisms of resistance to RT could transform GBM patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of radiation on the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) and the role of SSP in boosting antioxidant defenses in irradiated GBM cells and promoting radioresistance.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We compared copy number alterations (CNA) and amplification of SSP enzymes (PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, SHMT1\/2) in low-grade gliomas (LGG, n = 511) and GBM (n = 575) via TCGA pan-cancer analysis. <i>In vitro<\/i><b> <\/b>HPLC\/MS-based metabolomics assays were used to study the changes in overall metabolite levels induced by radiation in patient-derived GBM specimens. Targeted metabolomics with <sup>13<\/sup>C-labeled glucose was used for tracking the fate of glucose towards SSP intermediates and antioxidant species. Gene expression levels after radiation were measured via molecular biology approaches. <i>De novo<\/i> SSP was targeted via pharmacological inhibition of PHGDH. Modified clonogenic, sphere forming assays (SFA) on gliomasphere cultures were used to determine radiosensitivity. Dependence on extracellular serine\/glycine was determined via serine\/glycine depletion experiments.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The TCGA analysis revealed increased CNAs in all the <i>de novo <\/i>SSP enzymes in GBM tumors relative to the LGGs. 82% of GBM tumors had CNAs or amplification of the PSPH gene, which codes for the ultimate enzyme in serine synthesis. <i>In vitro <\/i>metabolomics assays revealed that radiation increases the levels of serine, glycine and cystine in gliomaspheres, and this is accompanied by elevated levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). Targeted glucose metabolomics revealed radiation-induced upregulation of the <i>de novo<\/i>SSP, with a concomitant increase in gene expression of SSP enzymes. Downstream of the SSP, metabolomics data show that irradiated GBM cells elevate nucleotide and precursor levels, likely to support DNA damage repair mechanisms after radiation. The inhibition of PHGDH, the first rate-limiting enzyme in <i>de novo <\/i>SSP, significantly reduced GBM cell survival <i>in vitro<\/i>.

Our previous study showed that high fiber diets sensitized RT112 xenografts to ionizing radiation (IR) by modifying the gut microbiome and this phenotype was positively correlated with <i>B.acidifaciens<\/i> (<i>BA<\/i>) abundance. It is noted that gut microbiota can enhance anti-tumoral responses, so we hypothesise that gut microbiota including <i>BA<\/i> may radiosensitize tumors via secretion of metabolites and immunomodulation.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> UPPL1591 mouse bladder cancer cell line flank xenografts were implanted into C57BL\/6 mice (an immune-competent setting) at the same time as starting low (0.2% cellulose) and high fiber (5% psyllium, 5% psyllium plus 10% resistant starch\/10% inulin) diets for their lifetime (N=30). 16S rRNA sequencing, IC-MS, IHC and the Nanostring platform were used for gut microbiota, untargeted metabolomics, and local tumor immunity analyses. For normal tissue toxicity studies, mice received 10-14 Gy IR (N=84). We used an intestinal crypt assay and FACS analysis of spleen to assess acute normal effects in small intestine and systemic immunity. Cell viability, clonogenic assay and Western blotting were used to validate the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effects of bacterial supernatants on RT112 human bladder cancer cells (N=3).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Psyllium plus either resistant starch (RS, p=0.007) or inulin (p&#60;0.001) significantly decreased tumors size. Psyllium plus inulin raised inosine-producing bacteria (p&#60;0.001) and faecal inosine levels (p&#60;0.001) which has been shown to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. Increased systemic (p=0.189) and local (p=0.024) anti-tumoral T cell responses were observed in the psyllium plus inulin group. Furthermore, the two diets mitigated the radiation injury from 14 Gy in intestinal crypt assays (p=0.011) and increased systemic immunity, with higher populations of B (p=0.024), cytotoxic T (p=0.019) and helper T (p&#60;0.001) cells. Psyllium plus RS or inulin significantly increased caecal size (p&#60;0.001), implying higher fermentation levels. We previously found inulin can enhance the relative abundance of <i>BA<\/i>. The supernatants of co-cultures of <i>BA<\/i> and <i>F.praunitzii<\/i> (<i>FP<\/i>, butyrate-producer) conferred greater cytotoxity than <i>BA<\/i> alone (p&#60;0.001) or co-cultures of <i>Bifidobacterium<\/i> and <i>FP <\/i>(p&#60;0.001), and also increased histone acetylation levels. Bacterial supernatants of <i>BA<\/i> increased DNA damage with 5Gy IR (p&#60;0.05) and radiosensitivity of bladder tumour cells (p=0.008 at 8Gy).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> <i>B.acidifaciens<\/i> is a potential radiosensitiser with enhanced efficacy in combination with butyrate-producing bacteria.

Firstly, we analyzed anti-cancer effect of JNC-1043. We performed MTT assay to detect IC50 values on several cancer cells - breast, lung, pancreatic, blood, gastric, colorectal cancers. In these experiments, 0.1~1 &#956;M IC50 values of JNC-1043 were calculated, and JNC-1043 treatments induced activation of caspase-3 and -8. Additionally, effective values of pharmacokinetic parameters in male rats and 2 weeks Dose Rate Finding (DRF) of JNC-1043 also detected. This result showed JNC-1043 is a promising anti-cancer candidate. Next, we tested whether radiosensitizing effect of JNC-1043. Each IC50 values of DLD-1 and HCT116 cell lines were calculated as 0.157, 0.1145, respectively.

Despite major advances in cancer treatment, radiation resistance contributes to increased morbidity and mortality of patients with HNSCC. Few FDA-approved radiosensitizers exist for the treatment of HNSCC and the majority are associated with severe adverse effects. Therefore, there is a clear need to examine novel treatment combinations to improve radiosensitivity and HNSCC outcomes. Isothiocyanates enhance response to cytokines, chemotherapy, and radiation in other in vitro and in vivo cancer models, including pancreatic and breast cancer. Isothiocyanates are antioxidants found in cruciferous vegetables such as watercress and broccoli. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) was well tolerated by patients in chemopreventative clinical trials and was thus selected for this study. We hypothesize that PEITC radiosensitizes HNSCC cells through increasing DNA damage, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Non-human papilloma virus or P16 negative HNSCC are associated with increased radioresistance and as such human HNSCC cell lines HN5 and CAL27 were selected. Combination of PEITC and photon radiation (XRT) decreased cell survival by half as compared to cells treated with PEITC or XRT alone for both HN5 and CAL27 cells as determined by clonogenic assay (n&#8805;3). PEITC enhanced XRT-induced apoptosis in HN5 and CAL27 cells as indicated by increased cleavage of effector caspases 3 and 7, which was reversed upon treatment with pan-caspase inhibitor, QVD-OPH. Preliminary comet assays identified that combination of PEITC with XRT significantly increased Tail DNA % relative to vehicle (p&#60;0.001), PEITC alone (p&#60;0.0001), or XRT alone (p&#60;0.0001) in HN5 cells. Preliminary data in CAL27 cells identified significantly increased signal of y-H2Ax in cells treated with both PEITC and XRT was 2.2 fold higher than XRT alone (p&#60;0.001) and 12.1 fold higher than PEITC alone (p&#60;0.001) in CAL27 cells. PEITC increased XRT-induced ROS generation in CAL27 cells relative to independent treatment as determined by 2&#8242;,7&#8242; dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining. Taken together, these results support that PEITC synergistically enhances HNSCC cell response to XRT. The results of this study warrant further investigation into the potential of PEITC to improve radiation efficacy in pre-clinical HNSCC models with the long-term goal of testing this well-tolerated compound in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d55ab320-7592-4895-9d89-68ae724afeac\/@y03B8ZU3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-08 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"H2AX,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Radiosensitization,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18958"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"7066878b-c922-49c2-b8f8-5d7ef704d913","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7066878b-c922-49c2-b8f8-5d7ef704d913\/@y03B8ZU3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christina Ann Wicker<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Poornima Dubey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vinita Takiar<\/i><\/presenter>.

Most immunotherapy agents are given systemically, but strategies for delivering immunotherapy locally are under clinical scrutiny to maximize efficacy and avoid toxicity. Local immunotherapy by injecting various patterns of molecules shows efficacy both preclinical and clinically. BO112 is a viral mimetic based on nanoplexed double stranded RNA (poly IC) which exerts immune-mediated antitumor effects in mice and humans upon intratumoral delivery. BO112 and external beam irradiation were used to make the proof-of-concept local immunotherapy plus radiation therapy combinations.<br \/>Methods: Murine transplantable tumor cells lines (TSA, MC38 and B16 ova) were used to show increased immunogenic features under irradiation as well as bilateral tumor models in which only one of the lesions could be irradiated. Flow cytometry on cell suspensions from tumor draining lymph nodes and multiplex tissue immunofluorescence were used to determine mechanims of antitumor immunity. Depletions of immune cell populations and knock out mice for IFNAAR and BAFT3 genes were used to delineate the immune system requirements for efficacy.<br \/>Results: In cultures of TSA breast cancer cells the combination of irradiation and BO112 showed more prominent features of immunogenic tumor-cell death including type I interferon rel&#233;ase. Injection of BO112 in the tumor lesions under radiation achieved excellent control of the treated tumors whilst modest delays in contralateral tumor progression were observed. Local effects were associated with more prominent presence of antitumor CTLs and cDC1 dendritic cells in the tumor and regional lymph nodes. Importantly, local irradiation plus BO112 in a tumor lesion enhanced the therapeutic effect of radiotherapy on distant uninjected tumor lesion.<br \/>Conclusions: This study demonstrates that local BO112 immunotherapy and external beam radiation therapy can exert synergies to achieve local tumor control. This beneficial effect can be extended to non-injected lesions as long as they are also irradiated, suggesting strategies to treat oligometastatic patients with lesions susceptible to radiotherapy and at least one of them accessible for BO112 repeated intratumoral injections.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6e4649db-67b7-465c-9c4f-ce9f64d9f717\/@y03B8ZU3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-01 Modulators of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation,Immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19052"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria.E.

Recently a series of novel quinacrines based upon a previously reported dimeric chloroquine has been synthesized. We studied one of these agents, DQ660. By itself, the drug upregulates both p53 protein and p53 transcriptional targets and also increases apoptosis in p53-wildtype H460 lung cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that DQ660 is a potent radiosensitizer <i>in vitro<\/i>. This radiosensitization is not contingent upon wildtype p53 as it occurs in cells null for p53 and containing mutant p53. The combination of radiation and DQ660 proded significant growth retardation of human xenografts grown <i>in vivo<\/i> compared to radiation or DQ660 alone. We saw higher levels of &#947;-H2AX foci with combined treatment compared to either alone, suggesting that the drug increases DNA damage induction. Using agarose gel electrophoresis and kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) as a substrate, we found that DQ660 can inhibit topoisomerase II activity. DQ660 did not potentiate the phosphorylation of ATM at S1981 seen after radiation. However, the drug did lead to an increase in Ser428 phosphorylation of ATR. This phosphorylation was not seen in response to radiation alone, suggesting that DQ660 and radiation activate different signaling pathways in response to DNA damage. We saw similar results with another dimeric quinacrine, DQ550, suggesting that this class of agents may be radiosensitizers. Our findings have uncovered a novel class of radiosensitizers that work at nanomolar concentrations and will spur investigations for its use in combination therapy for tumors treated with radiation","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0fd8f1e-d249-4a1c-bcd9-addc117cc483\/@z03B8ZU4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-08 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitization,DNA damage,p53,ATR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21749"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ilias V.
