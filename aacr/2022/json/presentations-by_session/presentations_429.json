[{"Abstract":"Hypoxia is present in most solid tumours and has been clinically correlated with poor prognosis, aggressive disease, and resistance to therapy in multiple cancer including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It has been shown PDAC hypoxia levels are highly heterogeneous and that patient-derived-xenografts (PDXs) of PDAC have similar histological phenotypes including hypoxia to their matching primary tumours. This suggests a strong genetic determinant may underlie variations in tumour hypoxia and it is not simply the result of random events of angiogenesis. We hypothesize the steady state levels of hypoxia across patient tumours is also influenced by tumour specific differences in oxygen metabolism and tolerance to hypoxia. Genetic driven changes in cellular metabolism influence the demand for oxygen, which defines the levels and steepness of hypoxia gradients around perfused vessels. Tolerance to hypoxia determines the time cells can survive in oxygen depleted microenvironments. Adaptive hypoxia stress responses such as the activation of HIF, UPR, and autophagy pathways can affect both these factors. To investigate relationship of the two factors to hypoxia, we established a matched panel of primary PDAC, PDX, and patient-derived-organoid (PDO) models covering the clinical spectrum of hypoxia. We characterized oxygen consumption and glycolytic rates of PDOs using Seahorse XF96. Hypoxia tolerance was measured by assessing PDO regrowth characteristics under defined levels of oxygenation. We then analyzed<i> <\/i>hypoxia gradients in matching PDXs by measuring the staining of the hypoxia marker, pimonidazole, as a function of distance to the nearest perfused blood vessels with an immunofluorescence image analysis pipeline. These data allow for characterizing the degree which tumour perfusion, oxygen consumption, and hypoxia tolerance correlates with and drives hypoxia levels. As a proof of concept in targeting the two proposed factors, we investigated in PDOs the effect of inhibiting ULK1, a kinase critical to autophagy initiation downstream of the PERK\/UPR pathway. The upregulation of ULK1 under hypoxia promotes survival through mitophagy and ER-phagy. This reduces cellular stress and severity of hypoxia by lowering oxygen consumption and ROS levels. Inhibition of ULK1 sensitized our panel of PDOs to severe hypoxia but at varying degrees. This is correlated with differences in their functional characteristics and genomic features. Understanding the impact of oxygen consumption and hypoxia tolerance on the individual tumour hypoxia levels sets the stage for identifying genetic drivers of tumour hypoxia and development of hypoxia-targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c5c6b133-11f8-4118-8b36-1160bf9b6c0a\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Pancreatic cancer,Unfolded protein response (UPR),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14917"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ji Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Cojocari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pedro Boasquevisque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Zaidi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trevor McKee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikolina Radulovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming-Sound Tsao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Hedley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianne Koritzinsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bradley Wouters<\/i><\/presenter>.

The canonical cellular response to hypoxia is largely driven by hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) that stimulate transcription of genes related to angiogenesis, cancer stem cells, cell survival, and glucose and iron metabolism. There is growing evidence that several factors, in addition to HIFs, contribute to the tumor hypoxia response. Thus, identifying novel mechanisms that regulate this cellular response in addition to the HIFs is key to our understanding of hypoxia and could have direct clinical impact. High expression of BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1), a heme-regulated bZIP transcription factor, drives metastatic progression in various cancers including TNBC. While BACH1 has been shown to be induced under hypoxia in some cell lines, its regulation and role in hypoxia signaling, specifically with regards to cancer cells, is poorly understood. Here we report a novel regulatory pathway of the tumor hypoxia response in TNBC. We show that BACH1 is post-translationally prolyl-hydroxylated by the HIF prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) in an oxygen-dependent and NRF2\/HMOX1-independent manner. Hypoxic exposure thus stabilizes BACH1 protein and enhances its DNA binding activity at loci of both canonical and hypoxia-specific downstream targets. We further show that BACH1 regulates the hypoxia response by promoting expression of both HIF-dependent and HIF-independent hypoxia-induced genes in TNBC cells. Our findings describe BACH1 as a novel oxygen-sensitive effector of the hypoxia response in TNBC that represents an alternative target for attenuating hypoxia-induced, pro-metastatic signaling and therapeutic resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d9c0c698-66b4-4ea6-b940-841d0dac7cdc\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Hypoxia,Signaling,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14924"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher M.

Furthermore, hypoxia pathways may also be activated in response to mutation in key tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. Importantly, in many types of cancer, activation of hypoxia pathways is associated with a clinically aggressive phenotype as well as with resistance to therapy. Indeed, hypoxia drives many of the &#8220;hallmarks&#8221; of cancer, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, immune responses, genomic instability, vascularization, invasion and metastasis. However, the full-range of genes activated by hypoxia varies greatly between cell-types and for many this remains uncharacterized. The key mediator of the cellular transcriptional response to hypoxia is the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) family of transcription factors. Here, we generate pan-genomic datasets encompassing HIF ChIP-seq and RNA-seq across cancer cell lines from diverse common tumor types. We then employ integrated analysis of our 72 transcriptome and whole-genome-binding datasets to define a core set of HIF-target genes that are conserved across multiple cell types. We show that these genes can be used to identify HIF activation and tumor hypoxia in bulk RNA-seq analysis of solid tumors, and that this can be applied to large tumor databases (TCGA). We then leverage this analysis to identify tumor-type-specific HIF-associated genes in 32 different cancer types, including those lacking cell-culture models. We further show that these conserved HIF-target genes can be applied to single cell RNA-seq datasets from solid tumors and used to examine intra-tumor heterogeneity in HIF-pathway activation within individual cancer samples. Importantly, using a panel of genes reduces the phenomenon of &#8220;drop-out&#8221; typically observed in gene-level expression in these datasets. Lastly, applying this gene signature to single cell data allows the hypoxia response to be deconvoluted across diverse cell-types in heterogenous tumor samples. This includes not only the identification of HIF-activity in cancer cells, but also in non-cancer cells within the tumor, thereby allowing the effects of intra-tumor hypoxia on stromal responses (such as tumor angiogenesis) to be studied in vivo in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b8fc7b30-14f2-4a0a-b91d-7991f913e2cb\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Hypoxia-inducible factor,Hypoxia-inducible genes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14922"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Olivia Lombardi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ran Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Halim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter J.

The canonical pathway of HIF-1&#945; degradation in normoxia is through the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase. We previously found that knockdown of CDK4 decreased HIF-1&#945; expression in a VHL-independent manner. To explore the mechanism of CDK4-induced HIF-1&#945; stabilization, we performed a proteomic analysis on HIF-1&#945;-interacting proteins with palbociclib treatment, a bioinformatic prediction of HIF-1&#945;-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases and identified SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (Smurf2) to be involved in a non-canonical HIF-1&#945; regulation mechanism. Overexpression of Smurf2 enhanced the ubiquitination of HIF-1&#945; and reduced expression of HIF-1&#945; in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Smurf2 overexpression downregulated HIF-1&#945; target gene <i>SLC2A1<\/i> but not <i>HIF1A <\/i>mRNA level in hypoxia. Knockdown of <i>SMURF2<\/i> increased HIF-1&#945; expression in normoxia even when <i>CDK4<\/i> was knocked-down. TCGA analysis showed correlation between high <i>SMURF2<\/i> mRNA and better prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). In KIRC, <i>VHL<\/i> loss is a frequent mutational event that leads to high constitutive expression of HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945;. Thus, we investigated a role for Smurf2 in HIF regulation in this cancer type. Overexpression of Smurf2 suppressed HIF-1&#945; expression in RCC4 VHL-deficient clear cell renal cancer line in normoxia. Knockdown of <i>SMURF2<\/i> increased HIF-1&#945; expression in RCC4 cells. Treatment of RCC4 cells with Smurf2 inhibitor Heclin also increased HIF-1&#945; expression in normoxia. HIF-2&#945; expression was reduced upon Smurf2 overexpression in RCC4 cells under normoxia and in SW480 colorectal cancer cells under hypoxia. In summary, Smurf2 mediates VHL-independent HIF-1&#945; degradation, which provides new insights for HIF-1&#945; targeting in cancers especially with VHL deficiency, and targeting of Smurf2 to increase HIF activity may have functional consequences in non-neoplastic disorders.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/949db1b6-a290-4131-98f1-440522d6753f\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia-inducible factor,Smurf2,CDK4\/6 inhibition,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14916"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shuai Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wafik S.

This helps tumor cells to survive in hypoxic microenvironment which is common in solid tumors such as prostate cancer (PCa). PCa cells characteristically store lipids, especially cholesterol. Furthermore, hypoxia and lipid metabolism are both associated with decreased responses to immune system and resistance to cancer treatments. Aim of this study was to investigate the impact of hypoxia on cell proliferation and lipid metabolism in advanced PCa cells at various stages of treatment resistance.<br \/>Material and Methods: PCa cells, VCaPs, were cultured for months to form several unique, treatment resistant advanced PCa cell lines as follows: first, cells were cultured with high (10 nM) testosterone level until they required testosterone for growth to form testosterone sensitive cell line (VCaP-T, demonstrating metastatic hormone sensitive PCa); second, VCaP-T cells were cultured further under low testosterone (0.1 nM) until they gained ability to grow at low androgen level, forming castration resistant cell line (VCaP-CT); third, VCaP-CT cells were further cultured with bicalutamide and\/or enzalutamide, androgen signaling inhibitors, until they again gained ability to grow despite the treatment, forming cell lines resistant to these drugs (VCaP-CT-BR, VCap-CT-ER, and VCaP-CT-BR-ER, demonstrating bicalutamide-, enzalutamide-, or mutually resistant cell lines, respectively).All cell lines were exposed to hypoxia (3% O<sub>2<\/sub>) with or without simvastatin (1 and 2.5 &#956;M) for 3 days and compared to the cells growing in normoxia. Changes in proliferation was measured using crystal violet staining and amount of intracellular lipids were evaluated using Oil Red O staining.<br \/>Results: Hypoxia decreased cell proliferation compared to normoxia by 20-25% in VCaP-T, VCaP-CT, and VCaP-CT-BR cells, but had no impact in enzalutamide-resistant cells VCaP-CT-ER or VCaP-CT-BR-ER. Simvastatin treatment decreased cell proliferation in all cell lines equally in hypoxia and normoxia.Compared to androgen-sensitive VCaP-T cells, all treatment resistant cell lines displayed greater intracellular lipid accumulation. Further analyses will address whether hypoxia and\/or simvastatin treatment impacts amount of intracellular lipids and whether inhibition of lipid accumulation leads to less tolerance to hypoxia.<br \/>Conclusion: Enzalutamide resistant cell lines displayed greater hypoxia tolerance compared to androgen sensitive or treatment na&#239;ve castration resistant cells. This indicates these cells are adopted to hypoxic microenvironment. All treatment resistant cell lines had greater intracellular lipid accumulation compared to testosterone-sensitive cells, suggesting importance of lipid metabolism in treatment resistance and hypoxia tolerance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3eb71096-b2ee-46d6-8ac7-ac5639eef9d5\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Prostate cancer,Lipid metabolism,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14921"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aino Siltari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Merja Bläuer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heimo Syvälä<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teuvo L.

Despite initial treatment response, castration-resistant prostate cancer nearly always develops and remains driven primarily by the androgen axis. We investigated how changes in oxygenation affect androgen synthesis. Our study indicates that when chronic hypoxia is coupled to reoxygenation, prostate cancer cells efficiently metabolize androgen precursors to produce androgens and activate AR. Hypoxia induces 3&#946;HSD1, the rate-limiting androgen synthesis regulator, and reoxygenation replenishes necessary cofactors. Therefore, hypoxia and reoxygenation are both essential for potent androgen synthesis.

Our data suggests that therapeutic resistance is mediated by stress-induced transition into a protective polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state. The PACC state is characterized by large size, polyploidization of the original aneuploid genome, and pause in cell cycle. Once released from stress, some PACCs survive to repopulate a non-polyploid, resistant cancer cell population. Using Nanostring technology to profile cisplatin-induced PACCs in prostate cancer PC3 and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, we observed significant increase in gene expression related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the DNA damage response (DDR). We hypothesize that ROS mediate a cancer cell&#8217;s ability to enter the PACC state to survive chemotherapy.ROS are produced as byproducts of cellular respiration and are present in all cells. ROS radicals are damaging to cellular macromolecules, particularly DNA. Cancer cells have evolved to withstand high ROS, but the increase in radicals contribute to genomic instability. ROS-induced DNA damage activates the DDR leading to four possible fates: continued cycling, DNA repair, apoptosis, or cell cycle arrest. Therapy significantly increases DNA damage while also increasing total ROS levels. At this level of DNA damage, the likely cell fates are death or cycle arrest. We induced the PACC state in PC3 cells with cisplatin and monitored ROS during PACC formation (24, 48, and 72 hours) using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry techniques. After 72 hours, the only surviving cells are in the PACC state. We found a step wise increase in the amount of ROS per cell across treatment time. By 72 hours, total ROS is 7-fold higher in PACCs compared to the parental control. PACCs are substantially larger than parental controls, so cell size must be considered. After adjusting for unit area, we found treated cells have a higher level of ROS compared to parental cells. The greatest increase in ROS per area was seen at 24hrs, suggesting there is an initial spike in ROS at the introduction of therapy. This suggests that the ability to enter the PACC state may be due to cell cycle arrest as a response to the extensive ROS caused by therapy. To assess cells that survive therapy in the PACC stateand produce resistant progeny, we induced PACC formation, then released therapy and monitored ROS for 10 days. Adjusted for area, ROS levels remained stable and elevated compared to parental control for 10 days following therapy release. The increase in ROS per unit area shows high ROS is not simply due to increased size. The stability over time suggests PACCs are able to manage ROS levels to prevent death by oxidative stress. Future work will evaluate PACCs induced by non-platinum chemotherapies, as well as, in additional cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5bf1ec44-0045-4f37-8a76-27c88118bf95\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Reactive oxygen species,Therapy resistance,Cell cycle arrest,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14915"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Morgan D.

Immunotherapy (IT) has provided new hope for other hard-to-treat cancers, but PDAC has shown striking resistance to IT by orchestrating mechanisms of immune escape. This spurs an interest to identify novel strategies to improve PDAC sensitivity to IT. We recently unveiled that perturbating redox homeostasis by targeting the antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4) render pancreatic cancer cells highly vulnerable. PRDX4 supports redox homeostasis by metabolizing H2O2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and its loss leads to oxidative stress and toxicity. Interestingly, cell death induced by PRDX4 depletion is accompanied by DNA damage and accumulation of cytosolic DNA, a potent primer for immune therapy. In line with that, PRDX4 knockdown results in the transcriptional upregulation of inflammatory genes, including type I interferons (IFNs), primary cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Importantly, our data indicate that this induction is dependent on the critical regulator of the innate immune responses, STING, as treatment with a STING inhibitor, or a STING knockdown, substantially blunts their upregulation. It is known that following DNA damage detection, the ER-localized STING translocates to the Golgi, where it associates with the kinase TBK1 and mediates the induction of inflammatory target genes, depending on IRF3 and NF-&#954;B transcription factors. We observe an activation of downstream STING effectors upon PRDX4 loss, and co-depletion with NF&#954;B significantly rescues the upregulation of those genes. As such, we propose that PRDX4 links ER-specific redox vulnerability to innate immunity signaling in PDAC. Since PRDX4 loss causes increased DNA damage and inflammatory signaling, our preliminary data suggest that PRDX4 could be a novel therapeutic target that may act synergistically with immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/552850e1-5f1f-44da-9159-8dcc602ab24f\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Redox,DNA damage,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14931"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"0659a55f-c419-4008-8c44-e625eb4b1f7b","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0659a55f-c419-4008-8c44-e625eb4b1f7b\/@D03B8ZKh\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lucie Malbeteau<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pallavi Jain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shane Harding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bradley Wouters<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianne Koritzinsky<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our lab hypothesizes that this resistance is driven by a subpopulation of cells in the tumor that enter the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state by undergoing a polyaneuploid transition (PAT). Cells in the PACC state are found in cell culture, xenograft, and genetically engineered mouse models, as well as in clinical samples. We have shown that cancer cells are induced to undergo a PAT upon exposure to external stress, such as chemotherapeutic treatments that include platinum-based therapy, etoposide, and taxane drugs. In addition, cells that enter the PACC state are resistant to that stress. One mechanism of therapy-induced cancer cell death is due to the resultant oxidative stress. We hypothesize that this oxidative stress drives a subset of cancer cells to undergo the PAT, thus enabling them to persist following treatment. To test the effects of oxidative stress on the PACC state, we treated cancer cells with cisplatin to induce the PAT and measured mitochondrial function and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using fluorescence microscopy with live-cell mitochondrial and ROS dyes, we showed that cells in the PACC state have higher mitochondrial mass, exhibit two to three times more mitochondrial activity per total mitochondria, and have over a five-fold increase in intracellular ROS levels per unit area when compared to typical cancer cell populations that they arise from. Moreover, PACCs exhibit a three-fold increase in their oxygen consumption rate and have higher expression of genes related to mitochondrial respiration and antioxidant pathways when compared to cells that did not undergo the PAT. Taken together, this suggests that cells in the PACC state may have a higher tolerance for stress since they can withstand higher amounts of ROS that result from both therapy and mitochondrial activity without exhibiting cell death. Our goal is to investigate how oxidative stress affects PACC formation and identify mechanisms of how PACCs manage stress to ultimately target these cells. If we can prevent PACC formation or find a method to eliminate cells in the PACC state, we can attack and resolve the issue of therapeutic resistance and incurability of metastatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc07cfde-5800-4641-9ebd-23ed728e9b69\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oxidative stress,Mitochondria,Therapy resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14919"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melvin Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah R.

It is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, which poses difficulties in the treatment of more advanced cancers. Despite this fact, the mechanisms contributing to the emergence of aggressive breast cancers remains poorly understood. We focus on reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are induced by a variety of stimuli in breast cancer cells. Moderately elevated ROS levels are tumor-promoting and facilitate the emergence of more aggressive tumours. Our laboratory has developed a unique model of HER2+ breast cancer that evolved to acquire more aggressive properties under conditions of chronic oxidative stress. We identified 20 transcription factors\/co-regulators that were specifically overexpressed in these aggressive breast cancers, compared to their parental counterparts. We hypothesize that these transcription factors are central to the ability of breast tumors to adapt to chronic oxidative stress and acquire more aggressive properties. To test this, I have performed an <i>in vivo <\/i>functional shRNA screen to identify those transcriptional regulators that drive an aggressive phenotype. This will be followed by functional validation studies to interrogate whether and how these unique transcription factors overexpressed in aggressive breast cancers impact tumour growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. Mechanistically, we will explore whether and how these transcriptional responses mediate adaptive responses to tumor microenvironmental stressors, including altered metabolism, hypoxia, and tumor immune responses. This research will broaden our understanding of how breast cancers adapt to oxidative stress responses and represents a necessary first step in the development of novel therapeutics against these invulnerable malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/01739f62-709e-4438-aff2-b48d508b866e\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oxidative stress,Hypoxia,Stemness,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14927"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caitlynn N.

Focused ultrasound (FUS) is being tested as a targeted noninvasive approach to eliminate the localized PCa foci, and strategies to enhance the anticancer potential of FUS have a high translational value. Since aggressive cancer cells utilize oxidative stress (Ox-stress) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER-stress) pathways for their survival and recurrence, we hypothesized that pre-treatment with drugs that disrupt stress-signaling pathways in tumor cells may increase FUS efficacy. Using four different PCa cell lines, i.e. LNCaP, C4-2B, 22Rv1 and DU145, we tested the <i>in vitro<\/i> effects of FUS, alone and in combination with two clinically-tested drugs that increase Ox-stress (i.e. CDDO-me) or ER-stress (i.e. Nelfinavir). As compared to standalone FUS, significant (p&#60;0.05) suppressions in both survival and recurrence of PCa cells were observed following pre-sensitization with low dose CDDO-me (100 nM) and\/or nelfinavir (2 &#181;M). In drug pre-sensitized cells, significant anticancer effects were evident at a FUS intensity of as low as 0.7 kW\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>. This combined mechanochemical disruption (MCD) approach decreased cell proliferation, migration and clonogenic ability, and increased apoptosis\/necrosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, although activated in cells that survived standalone FUS, pre-sensitization with CDDO-me and\/or nelfinavir suppressed both total and activated (phosphorylated) NF-&#954;B and Akt protein levels in surviving cells. Thus, a combined MCD therapy may be an effective noninvasive approach towards targeted elimination of aggressive PCa cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72c110de-c3ad-44f1-b6b4-9cec0fc77e66\/@D03B8ZKh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Cell death,Stress response,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14930"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hakm Y.

Antioxidant defense adaptations thus accompany metabolic alterations as essential survival mechanisms during metastasis. We observe that oxidative phosphorylation is increased when ovarian cancer (OC) cells transition to anchorage independence (a-i), an important step during metastasis in the peritoneal cavity. To combat the rise in oxidative stress resulting from this metabolic shift, a rapid increase in the sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)\/superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) axis occurs to reduce the mitochondrial superoxide anion surge and to maintain cellular viability. We demonstrate that this upregulation occurs in transcription, translation, and SIRT3-mediated regulation of SOD2 activity. However, the fate of the hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>) resulting from superoxide dismutation through SIRT3\/SOD2 remains unknown. RNAseq analysis of attached versus a-i conditions revealed a significant downregulation of peroxiredoxin 3, a major scavenger of H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2 <\/sub>in the mitochondria, suggesting that OCs have a net increase in mitochondrial H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> in a-i. At sub-lethal levels, H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> serves as a second messenger of redox signaling, primarily via protein cysteine oxidation, which has been implicated with metastasis. We thus hypothesize that increases in SIRT3\/SOD2\/H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> play a role as mediators of redox signaling during OC anchorage-independent survival, spheroid formation and metastasis. Using the HyPer7 redox probe and manipulation of SIRT3 and SOD2 expression, H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> generation and localization in a-i are being assessed using 3D fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, siRNA mediated knock-down of SIRT3 in a-i leads to the downregulation of genes involved in specific signaling pathways, including NF-kB signaling, the inflammatory response, and metabolism. Mass-spec studies are underway to identify specific SIRT3 target proteins upstream of these transcriptional changes, by assessing global cysteine oxidation and the cellular acetylome to determine the role of H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>-dependent redox signaling and SIRT3-dependent protein de-acetylation, respectively. Given the increase in SIRT3-dependent inflammatory signaling in a-i, we are exploring how the SIRT3\/SOD2\/H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> axis influences OC interaction with tumor associated macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells, commonly found in the ascites tumor environment. This work demonstrates a multi-faceted role for the SIRT3\/SOD2\/H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2 <\/sub>axis in a-i survival, a key step during OC metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cef6c820-3329-4b31-a21c-8a985943545c\/@E03B8ZKi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Reactive oxygen species,Tumor metastases,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14926"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Priscilla Tang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeon Soo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Piyushi Gupta-Vallur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amal T.

Components of pomegranate seed extracts (PSOs) have been shown to have antioxidant, anti-glycemic, and antimicrobial activity, and recent research has demonstrated that PSOs can inhibit the growth of select cancers <i>in vitro<\/i>. One of the main components of PSO is punicic acid, an omega-5 fatty acid that is capable of inhibiting breast and prostate cancer cell proliferation, although the mechanisms of action are not yet known. In order to further understand its potential anti-cancer properties, we investigated the effect of punicic acid on proliferation and viability of human MCF7 breast cancer cells. Cells were treated with various concentrations of punicic acid (between 10 and 100ug\/ml) for up to 72 hours, and various endpoints were measured including cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis. We found that all doses led to a significant reduction in cell viability based on an MTS assay. We also found a dose-dependent effect of punicic acid on cytotoxicity, as measured by an LDH release assay. Cell death was confirmed to be, at least in part, due to apoptosis, as detected by Annexin V and propidium iodide fluorescence. While 10 ug\/ml punicic acid induced measurable cell death by 48 hours, higher concentrations were toxic to cells within the first 24 hours of treatment. Since many of the peroxiredoxin (Prdx) family of antioxidant proteins are known to involved in cancer cell survival, and our lab previously demonstrated their regulation in MCF7 cells, we examined the effect of punicic acid on Prdx expression. We found members of this gene family to be significantly elevated within 24 hours of punicic acid treatment. Altogether, our data definitively demonstrates anti-cancer properties of punicic acid, as well as its ability to regulate antioxidant gene expression in these cells.<i> <\/i>This research has important implications in the field of natural products as therapeutic options for cancer treatment, as opposed to conventional chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5ccab751-0f8a-4adb-b833-e00d76e1fce6\/@E03B8ZKi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,MCF-7 cells,Antioxidant,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14925"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Oluwafemi Gbayisomore<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannah Klausner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shelley A.

In the intracellular space, cystine is converted into cysteine which is subsequently used for glutathione (GSH) synthesis (a major antioxidant species). ARID1A is part of the SWI-SNF remodeling complex that binds on the xCT promoter and as such controls its gene expression. ARID1A deficiency which is highly prevalent in many cancers results in downregulation of xCT, impaired GSH biosynthesis and subsequent ROS induction, raising potential rationale to target xCT in ARID1A deficient cancers. By using a selective nanomolar range xCT inhibitor, we first showed that cell lines deficient for ARID1A were significantly more sensitive to the inhibition of xCT. Effects on proliferation could be reversed by N-acetylcysteine supplementation in the culture medium. <i>In vivo, <\/i>the xCT inhibitor confirmed its drug-like properties showing significant target engagement in an ARID1A deficient ovarian cell line xenograft model together with good PK and tolerability profiles.

Gain of function mutations in proteins within the Ras\/MAPK pathway in melanocytes leads to the formation of benign neoplasms, or nevi. Multiple mechanisms prevent the transformation of nevi into invasive cancer, namely, oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and immunosurveillance. Of interest to the melanomagenesis process is the p66ShcA redox protein. We have found that compared to other solid cancers, the majority of primary human melanomas, patient-derived xenografts and melanoma cell lines strongly overexpress p66ShcA, an adaptor protein that induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to stress stimuli. Indeed, UV light, increases p66ShcA levels and p66ShcA-induced oxidative stress, which is relevant to this disease as sun exposure contributes significantly to melanoma development. We hypothesized that p66ShcA may play a crucial role in the early steps of melanocyte transformation, possibly by contributing to the overriding of OIS and immune surveillance.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Melanoma initiation and progression will be examined in a known transgenic mouse model (<i>Tyr::CRE<\/i>\/<i>braf<\/i><sup>CA<\/sup>\/<i>pten<sup>lox\/lox<\/sup><\/i>) either in the presence of endogenous levels of p66ShcA or in an inducible p66ShcA over-expression setting. The necessity of p66ShcA-high expression for melanocyte BRAFV600E-transformation will be tested in immortalized melanocytes. Lastly, to explore the potential selection advantage conferred by p66ShcA, its expression will be silenced in a panel of known melanoma cell lines. Clonogenic assays as well as mouse xenografts will be performed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>TCGA melanoma datasets, immunoblot analysis of human melanoma cell lines (n&#62;10), and a collection of metastatic patient-derived xenografts (PDX) (n=6) indicate uniformly elevated p66ShcA levels compared to other cancer types. Knock-down of p66ShcA in multiple melanoma cell lines reduces their clonogenic potential. This reduction in colony formation is independent of driver mutation (e.g., BRAF, NRAS, NF1). Suggesting that p66ShcA may sustain melanoma proliferation. Furthermore, xenografts of the murine YUMM1.7 cell line (<i>braf <\/i>mutant, <i>cdkn2a<\/i> null and <i>pten<\/i> null) in immune-deficient and immune-competent mice indicate that loss of p66ShcA (YUMM1.7 p66ShcA-KO) delays tumor formation, specifically in mice with an intact immune system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f0f4594-bdf9-41ac-868d-fe27f5cd1c0a\/@E03B8ZKi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transformation,Reactive oxygen species,Senescence,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14932"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eduardo Cepeda Canedo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonia Del Rincon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Siegel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Witcher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josie Ursini-Siegel<\/i><\/presenter>.
