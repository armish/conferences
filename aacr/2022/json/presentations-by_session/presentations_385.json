[{"Abstract":"Antigen-mediated antibody internalization is an important factor influencing kinetics and efficacy of antibody-based therapeutics. Antibodies directed against HER2, CD20, FLT3, EGFR, CD10 and CD22 have been shown to undergo internalization upon binding to their target antigens. Although antibody-induced internalization may be desirable under some circumstances, for example in case of antibody-drug conjugates, it can subvert the therapeutic efficacy of ADCC-inducing antibodies and bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) aiming to mobilize T cells against cancer. Here we examined the turnover of PSMA, a target antigen widely used for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in prostate cancer. As a model system, we used prostate cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of PSMA in functional analyses with our PSMAxCD3 bsAb CC-1 which is currently being evaluated in two clinical trials (NCT04104607 and NCT04496674). Antigen internalization kinetics was analyzed by flow cytometric-internalization assays and live-cell imaging of antibody internalization. These analyses revealed that surface PSMA expression is rapidly downregulated after binding of PSMAxCD3 bsAb. Internalization occured in a dose-dependent manner, with complete negativity observed at concentrations &#8805;0.1 &#181;g\/ml. After withdrawal of the bsAb, antigen surface levels were fully restored within 24 hours. PSMA internalization was found to be partially prevented by inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Currently, we are screening various clinically approved clathrin-dependent endocytosis inhibitors (e.g. statins and chloroquine) to identify compounds for combinatorial approaches to prevent undesired PSMA internalization in patients receiving PSMAxCD3 bsAbs. Altogether, our results document the involvement of clathrin-dependent endocytosis in bsAbs-driven PSMA internalization and provide a basis for combinatorial approaches to increase the efficacy of PSMA-directed therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63bb096e-2caa-4c14-adc0-3ca90f3f088c\/@z03B8ZGg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Bispecific antibody,Prostate cancer,Antigen internalization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16920"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"3c391607-0c1c-4a95-a883-7f5ac0a141c8","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c391607-0c1c-4a95-a883-7f5ac0a141c8\/@z03B8ZGg\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Klimovich<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Latifa Zekri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gundram Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helmut R.

Here we study its performance against three-dimensional tumor organoids in cocultures with T cells as compared to a higher affinity CEACAM5-CD3 (CEACAM5-TCB) bispecific antibody using time-lapse confocal microscopy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pre-labelled spheroids derived from colon cancer cell lines and primary organoids derived from four colorectal cancer surgical specimens, which expressed different graded levels of CEA, were exposed in cocultures to T lymphocytes. Cocultures were treated with CEA-CD3 T-cell engagers and were followed by live confocal microscopy. Caspase 3 activation detected in real-time was used as an indicator of tumor cell death. Co-cultures were also set up with autologous tumor-associated fibroblasts to test the co-stimulatory effect of a fibroblast activated protein (FAP)- targeted 4-1BBL bispecific antibody fusion protein currently undergoing clinical trials.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Tumor-cell killing of 3D colon carcinoma cultures was dependent on the levels of surface CEA expression, in such a way that the lower affinity agent (CEA-TCB) did not mediate killing by human preactivated T cells below a certain CEA expression threshold, while the high affinity construct (CEACAM5-TCB) remained active on the low CEA expressing organoids. Modelling heterogeneity in the levels of CEA expression by coculturing CEA high and low organoids showed measurable but weak bystander killing. Cocultures of tumor organoids, autologous fibroblasts and T cells allowed to observe a costimulatory effect of anti-FAP-4-1BBL both to release IFN&#947; and to attain more efficacious tumor cell killing.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Three-dimensional tumor cocultures with T cells using live confocal microscopy provide suitable models to test the requirements for colon-cancer redirected killing as elicited by CEA-targeted T-cell engagers undergoing clinical trials and treatment allow combinations to be tested in a relevant preclinical system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd34eaec-a9ac-409c-b1de-38aec58f023b\/@z03B8ZGg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Organoids,Carcinoembryonic antigen,Costimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16921"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alvaro Teijeira<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Itziar Migueliz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saray Garasa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Bacac<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Klein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignacio Melero<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, tumor specific CD28 targeting in a tumor associated antigen (TAA)&#215;CD28 bispecific format, similar to the clinically validated tumor specific CD3 bispecific T-cell engagers (TCEs), offers an attractive solution to mitigate the serious safety concerns associated with systemic CD28 activation while delivering potent T-cell costimulatory signal. Our goal is to combine tumor specific bispecific TCEs targeting both CD3 and CD28, the two essential pathways in T cell activation for safe and long-lasting T cell-mediated synergistic immunotherapies. Following our success in utilizing the CD3 POWERbody&#8482; TCE platform for tumor targeting with tight safety control, we further applied our suite of antibody technologies to develop tumor specific bispecific CD28 POWERbody TCE programs. Our NEObody&#8482; and SAFEbody<sup>&#174;<\/sup> technologies enabled us to discover and engineer species cross-reactive anti-CD28 antibodies targeting a unique and conserved epitope of CD28 as well as precision masking of the antigen binding sites for conditional activation in tumor microenvironment. The engineered tailor-made anti-CD28 arm and the tumor specific antigen targeting arm were then integrated into our proprietary bispecific platform that has robust CMC properties. Toward this end we developed multiple TAA&#215;CD28 bispecific TCEs, including B7-H3&#215;CD28, HER2&#215;CD28, and TROP-2&#215;CD28, etc., which possess fine-tuned specificity and safety profiles to minimize their on-target off-tumor toxicities and to prevent the systemic cytokine release syndrome (CRS). These TAA&#215;CD28 bispecific POWERbodies have no superagonist activities on their own and can be activated for tumor antigen binding by the TAA arm and T cell engagement by the CD28 arm. When combined with TAA&#215;CD3 TCEs and\/or checkpoint inhibitors, they show strong synergistic T cell-mediated antitumor responses with robust safety profiles. Taken together, our tumor specific CD28 bispecific POWERbody TCEs exhibit enormous potential to fulfill the promises of safe and durable T cell-mediated immunotherapies when combined with CD3 bispecific POWERbody TCEs and\/or checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6fa3327d-276f-4e6a-8175-ca5b346b1592\/@z03B8ZGg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Costimulation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16922"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guizhong Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengxi Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiagui Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianfeng Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bin Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron N.

The humanized BCMA (clone 4C8A) antibody that effectively targeted multiple myeloma in a CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) format was used for designing several formats of bispecific BCMA-CD3 antibodies. Several different designs including univalent and bivalent BCMA-CD3 CrossMAB; triple chain BCMA-FAB-CD3 ScFv-Fc and tetravalent BCMA ScFv-CD3 ScFv-Fc antibodies were tested for affinity and binding with BCMA-positive cells and T cells. Real time cytotoxic activity (RTCA) and IFN-gamma secretion were also tested with multiple myeloma and CHO-BCMA target cells. All BCMA bispecific antibody designs demonstrated specific affinity with CHO-BCMA but not CHO cells in the nanoM range of 0.3-33 nM; all designs bound to T cells by FACS. The triple chain BCMA-FAB-CD3 ScFv-Fc designs had the highest Kd of binding with CHO-BCMA cells (Kd=0.3 nM) and with multiple myeloma MM1S, and H929 cells (0.1 and 0.3 nM, respectively). All antibodies with T cells specifically killed CHO-BCMA and multiple myeloma cells in a dose-dependent manner but not CHO or K562 cells, measured by RTCA assay.

Herein we have developed a novel Adaptable Drug Affinity Conjugate (ADAC), a refinement of a traditional Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) with a focus on tailored drug design. The cargo for ADAC is synthetic long peptides that can be modified with the profiled genetic data for each patient. The ADAC technology relies on a high-affinity interaction between a short non-immunogenic peptide-tag (pTag) and a single-chain fragment (scFv) and the targeting of CD40 expressing antigen-presenting cells. As a proof-of-concept study, we have generated data supporting a ~20 times improved half-life of peptide therapeutics bound up by the ADAC technology (in vitro), translating to improved peptide half-life in vivo along with a superior expansion of T cells in vitro and in vivo, compared to peptide and antibody mixed but not interacting physically. Through phage-display selection screening of novel CD40 agonistic antibodies, we identified a unique clone (STRIKE-1001). STRIKE-1001 binds a defined structural epitope (HDX-MS) of CD40 in a low nM range and is agonistic in an IgG2 format. Similar to selicrelumab, STRIKE-1001 does not block CD40L binding to Fc-CD40. STRIKE-1001 shows a dose-dependent agonistic activity (EC50 of ~28 nM based on measured induction of HLA-DR expression) on human DCs and can be designed into a bispecific antibody without loss of agonistic activity. STRIKE-1001 is currently incorporated into the ADAC platform to be used as the first-in-class candidate for flexible peptide cargo delivery ensuring T cell priming and expansion in vivo as a means to transform CD40 agonistic antibody to clinically relevant drug candidates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a30ba5c-1615-418e-b380-6349e767b56c\/@z03B8ZGg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),CD40,Neoantigens,Peptides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16924"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ida LaurÃ©n<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed Eltahir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aman Mebrahtu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosanne Veerman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Astorga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aljona Saleh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jimmy Ytterberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annika Lindqvist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leif Dahllund<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anders Olsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oskar Andersson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johan Rockberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helena Persson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sara Mangsbo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Naturally occurring cancer-reactive TCRs have weak affinity and require substantial affinity enhancements for their cognate pMHC. However, the outcome of this process is difficult to predict and bears the risk for off-target cross reactivities in normal tissues, which may lead to severe adverse events in the clinic. Here, we describe a highly potent dual pMHC T-cell engager (TCE) antibody format with high specificity towards tumor-specific pMHCs utilizing an HLA-A*02:01 restricted MAGE-A4 epitope to validate the concept. A series of monovalent and bivalent antibody constructs composed of anti-MAGE-A4 binding arms, ranging in affinities from 30 nM to 100 pM, were fused to an anti-CD3 Fab fragment with lower affinity compared to that commonly used for TCR-fusions. The different antibody constructs were evaluated for selective killing of MAGE-A4\/HLA-A*02 positive human U2OS osteosarcoma and A375 melanoma cancer cells versus a panel of different MAGE-A4-negative\/HLA-A*02-positive human cell lines. Bivalent bispecific antibody variants mediated a 7-fold greater degree of cancer cell killing and similarly increased T cell activation compared to their monovalent bispecific counterparts. EC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranged as low as single digit picomolar, while the overall cross reactivity against MAGE-A4-negative\/HLA-A*02-positive cells was not substantially affected. These results prove that dual targeting of pMHCs on cancer cells provides selective and efficient T cell-mediated target cell killing and T cell activation, even at very low levels of pMHC on the cell surface, highlighting the pivotal roles played by the affinity of the individual arms, valency, and epitope densities. We further analyzed the dual pMHC TCE for potential off-target effects by recognition of similar and physiologically relevant non-MAGE-A4 peptides. T2 cells pulsed with similar peptides and co-cultured with PBMC effector cells showed no significant T cell activation or IFNg release in the presence of the dual pMHC TCE in comparison to MAGE-A4 peptide-pulsed T2 cells. Finally, we compared the dual pMHC TCE against a recombinant TCR fused to an anti-CD3 scFv, a construct that is currently in clinical development. Interestingly, the dual pMHC TCE resulted in a 3-fold more potent cancer cell killing while having significantly lower effect on cytokine production. In conclusion, dual pMHC targeting with TCE antibodies is an attractive alternative to soluble affinity-enhanced TCR-based cancer immunotherapies as they facilitate potent tumor targeting without the need for extensive affinity enhancements.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f9177d10-ec6e-4496-bc6c-596873df7859\/@z03B8ZGg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Immuno-oncology,Targeted therapy,T cell engager,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16925"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephanie Jungmichel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabian Scheifele<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Sobieraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Severin Wendelspiess<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Schleier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Knobel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camilla Winnewisser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Vrohlings<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Richle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannes Merten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqueline Blunschi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Leisner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leonardo Borras<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, identifying appropriate tumor-specific targets that avoid adverse effects in healthy tissue has been challenging. The tight junction protein Claudin 6 (CLDN6) is a validated therapeutic target for many solid tumor types, including ovarian, endometrial, testicular, and gastric. It is differentially expressed on cancer cells with no reported expression in normal, healthy tissue. Despite being an attractive target, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting CLDN6 are difficult to discover due to an abundance of closely related family members and an absolute need for high specificity. There are 26 human CLDN family members, and most are broadly expressed and highly conserved. The extracellular region of CLDN6 closely resembles the widely expressed CLDN9 (3 amino acids different). The few CLDN6 MAbs in clinical development have demonstrated significant binding to other CLDN family members and most have now been halted from development. Using Integral Molecular&#8217;s MPS antibody discovery platform, we have been able to isolate, and optimize rare antibodies against CLDN6 that do not cross-react with other CLDN family members.<br \/>The exquisite specificity of our CLDN6 antibodies makes them amenable to use as the tumor-targeting arm of bispecific T-Cell Engagers. Starting with highly specific CLDN6 antibodies with a range of affinities, we engineered a large set (&#62; 50) of CLDN6xCD3 bispecific antibodies (CLDN6 bispecifics) using multiple formats and CD3 arms that encompass different valencies and geometries. We designed the CLND6 arms to include antibody moieties with different affinities, epitopes, and stoichiometries, as these factors are expected to play a critical role in the potency of these molecules both in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The full panel of bispecifics has been functionally tested in <i>in vitro<\/i> T cell cytotoxicity assays cells and has demonstrated potent killing of CLDN6-expressing cells with minimal killing of cells expressing other closely related claudin family members. We have also extensively characterized this panel of bispecific antibodies for detailed binding to both CD3 and CLDN6, selectivity against closely related claudin family members, and developability. The bispecifics were also screened for specificity against ~6,000 membrane proteins, representing &#62; 95% of the entire human membrane proteome.<br \/>Solid tumors lead to 580,000 deaths annually in the US, and safe and effective therapeutics for many late-stage solid tumors are lacking. Ovarian cancer alone kills 14,000 people each year, and many patients do not respond to currently available treatments. The exquisite specificity of our CLDN6xCD3 bispecifics suggests their potential to address the need for potent therapeutic modalities for ovarian and other cancers without compromising patient safety.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d093fb42-1ad4-4b51-ad93-3421d4533d50\/@A03B8ZGh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody engineering,Bispecific antibody,Ovarian cancer,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16926"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joseph Rucker<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Doolan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Breanna Tyrell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Lobley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nick Molino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Shema<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Guldner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alyssa Cunningham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ross Chambers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riley Payne<\/i><\/presenter>.

They are emerging as a growing class of immunotherapies with potential to further improve clinical efficacy and safety. Besides tumor-targeted and dual immunomodulators, the most important class of therapeutically relevant bispecific antibodies are engagers of cytotoxic immune cells to kill tumor cells. These are mainly engager of T-cells (BiTE&#180;s), but also NK-cell engager several of which have entered clinics with Blinatumomab (anti-CD3\/anti-CD19) being FDA-approved for the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Several studies are under way to address potential combinatorial effects with other compounds in clinics. In order to facilitate analysis of the cytotoxic impact of BiTE&#180;s in high throughput, we developed a 384-well format assay system based on Luciferase-labeled tumor cells. This detection technology has many advantages. As only the tumor cells are labeled, the specific detection of luciferase exclusively correlates to the number of viable tumor cells, allowing for co-cultures with high excess of effector cells without them interfering in the detection. Due to high sensitivity, only few tumor cells are required for a decent signal\/noise ratio, keeping the overall need for primary effector cells to the lowest, even at high effector\/target cell ratios. That can be of great advantage when working with rare cytotoxic subpopulations (e.g. NK-cells), precious samples from patients, or simply saves resources when performing large exploratory studies. In addition, combination of low 384-well format volumes with nanodrop agent dispensing technology minimizes amounts of expensive antibodies and other agents. Applying this technology, we evaluated the combinatorial effects of Blinatumomab with immune modulators (e.g. Lenalidomide), kinase inhibitors (e.g. MEK-inhibitor, Selumetinib) and other clinically relevant agents (e.g. MCL1-inhibitor, S63845) on the Luciferase-labeled GCB-like DLBCL cell line OCI-LY1. Depending on compound combination, we observe synergistic but also antagonistic effects. Our data support the outstanding usefulness of this methodological approach for the exploration of bispecific cytotoxic immune cell engager agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30d3e39a-8832-44fe-868d-18b80ff99964\/@A03B8ZGh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BiTE antibody,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Cytotoxicity,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16927"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carla N.

Engagement of CD47 on tumor cells with SIRP&#945; on macrophages inhibits phagocytosis of tumor cells. Anti-CD47 antibodies block the CD47 - SIRP&#945; engagement and reactivate phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages. Yet the ubiquitous expression of CD47 on normal cells, including red blood cells, presents a therapeutic challenge. Systemic targeting of CD47, by either anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies or SIRP&#945;-Fc fusion proteins, yielded only moderate clinical benefit due to severe adverse side effects, mainly anemia. QL401 is PD-L1 x CD47 bispecific antibody engineered to reduce binding to red blood cells while retaining potent phagocytic activation of macrophages in vitro and delayed tumor growth in vivo. QL401 comprises three functional components: a PD-L1 binding Fab arm, a CD47 binding scFv arm, and a human IgG4 backbone. The PD-L1 binding arm provides both tumor targeting and blocking of PD-1 for reactivating T cells. The CD47 arm blocks the binding of SIRP&#945;, the &#8220;Do Not Eat Me&#8221; signal, while the IgG4 Fc retains Fc gamma receptor binding to provide a phagocytic &#8220;Eat Me&#8221; signal. Therefore, QL401 is multi-functional antibody that re-actives both the innate and adaptive immune response. In preclinical efficacy studies, QL401 potently blocked SIRP&#945; to promote phagocytosis of tumor cells with sub-nanomolar potency. In vivo efficacy studies in mouse models of solid and hematological tumors showed QL401 to be comparable or superior to PD-L1 or CD47 monoclonal antibodies alone and in combination. In vitro safety evaluation of Q401 showed significantly reduced binding and phagocytosis of red blood cells, in contrast to CD47 monoclonal antibodies. In addition, Q401 did not induce hemagglutination. In non-human primates, QL401 was well tolerated up to 100 mg\/kg without reduction of red blood cells below normal range. A phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study is expected to start Q1 2022 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and early efficacy of QL401.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a776c1cf-163a-49a8-ae65-1362690c706e\/@A03B8ZGh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,PD-L1,Bispecific antibody,Phagocytosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16928"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Irene Tang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Schwimmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shenda Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Wei Prior<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hieu V.

T-cell-engaging antibodies, linking tumor cells to T cells, are being developed to treat malignancies. HPN424 is a Tri-specific T-cell Activating Construct (TriTAC), binding PSMA, CD3<i>&#949;<\/i> , and albumin to improve drug half-life. We evaluated the activity of HPN424 to induce T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against organoids generated from patient-derived xenograft (PDX-Os) established from human mCRPC biopsies.<br \/><b>Design: <\/b>PDX-Os from three models were evaluated; their membranous PSMA immunohistochemical expression was quantified using H-scores (HS). PDX-Os were co-cultured with: i) healthy donor allogeneic T cells, ii) healthy donor allogeneic T cells combined with HPN424 (1pM, 10pM or 100pM), or iii) healthy donor allogeneic T cells combined with PL711, a non-targeting TriTAC control (1pM, 10pM, 100 pM). Cytotoxicity was determined by LDH release and visualisation of T cell\/PDO co-localisation and PDO disruption using confocal microscopy. Early and mid-late T cell activation was determined by FACS for CD69 and CD25 expression, respectively. Cytolytic (CTL) and CD4 T cell cytokine release (IFN<i>&#947;<\/i> , TNF<i>&#8733;<\/i> , IL-1<i>&#946;<\/i> \/2\/4\/6\/8\/10) was evaluated using the AlphaLISA kit (MSD). FACS studies were performed after 48- and 72-hours, while microscopy, LDH and cytokine assays were performed after 24, 48, and 72-hours, of co-culture respectively.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the highest PSMA-expressing PDX-Os (CP50c, HS: 225; CP142c, HS: 165), co-culture of resting healthy donor T cells with CRPC PDX-Os led to dose-dependent increases in LDH release at 48-hours (p&#60;0.0001) and 72-hours (p&#60;0.0001), in the presence of HPN424 but not PL711. Correspondingly, in these models, confocal microscopy showed T cells co-localising with and disrupting the PDX-Os by 24-hours across all 3 HPN424 concentrations tested. HPN424 induced T-cell expression of CD25 and CD69 within 48-hours of co-culture across all 3 concentrations in both models. When compared with PL711, HPN424 induced dose-dependent upregulation of IFN<i>&#947;<\/i> , IL-1<i>&#946;<\/i> , IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF&#8733; in the PSMA-high PDX-Os, CP50c and CP142c (all p&#60;0.0001), indicating T cell activation and induction of CTL and Th1\/Th2\/Treg cytokines by HPN424. Interestingly, in co-cultures of T cells and CP89c PDX-Os, which have lower PSMA expression (HS of 25), HPN424 did not significantly increase LDH release when compared with PL711; in this model CD25\/CD69 induction and the upregulation of IFN<i>&#947;<\/i> , IL-1<i>&#946;\/<\/i> 2, and TNF&#8733; was only observed at the highest concentration of HPN424 (100pM).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: HPN424, a PSMA-targeting TriTAC antibody construct, induced T cell activation and elicited T-cell mediated cytotoxicity against PSMA expressing mCRPC PDX-Os. Our data support further evaluation of this agent in advanced PC with membranous PSMA expression. <i><\/i><i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/347de621-5450-4f8f-8b04-8cbaedea80a8\/@A03B8ZGh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16932"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Veronica Gil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Christina Guo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Seed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antje Neeb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorenzo Buroni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bora Gurel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ines Figueiredo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Golzar Hemmati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wade Aaron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johann S.

Targeted depletion of tumor-infiltrating Tregs (TITRs) is an attractive therapeutic strategy with the potential to enhance antitumor immunity in patients who do not respond to current treatments. However, such approaches have been limited to date by a lack of markers that are highly specific for TITRs. CCR8 is a chemokine G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that has recently been shown to be specifically expressed on TITRs as compared to Tregs in the periphery or other T cells within tumors. Here, we report the development and characterization of HFB101110, a humanized monoclonal antibody against CCR8 with potent and specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. HFB101110 specifically recognizes an epitope on the N-terminus extracellular domain of CCR8 and does not recognize the closely related chemokine receptor CCR4. HFB101110 acts through a dual mechanism of action, by both depleting CCR8+ cells via<i> <\/i>ADCC and blocking binding of the CCL1 chemokine to its receptor CCR8. Blockade by HFB101110 inhibited calcium flux and chemotaxis induced by the interaction between CCL1 and CCR8. Furthermore, HFB101110 showed potent single agent anti-tumor activity associated with depletion of intratumoral Tregs in a human CCR8 knock-in mouse model. HFB101110 mediated specific <i>ex vivo<\/i> killing of Tregs from primary patient tumor samples both in the presence, and in some cases the absence, of allogeneic NK cells. HFB101110 showed favorable pharmacokinetic properties and a favorable developability profile, and was well-tolerated in both wild-type mice and cynomolgus monkeys. HFB101110 is currently being developed as a novel immunotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors coupled with a patient biomarker strategy derived from HiFiBiO&#8217;s Drug Intelligent Science (DIS&#8482;) single-cell immune profiling platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2fa9ac7a-90c1-4eb4-9d4c-bd0d4feedc61\/@A03B8ZGh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunotherapy,Immunomodulation,Immunostimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16933"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Roshan M.

Systemic depletion of normal and malignant B-cells by anti-CD20 antibodies (e.g. rituximab and obinutuzumab) and anti-CD37 antibodies (e.g. otlertuzumab and BI 836826) has been well tolerated in clinical studies. Depletion of B-cells is reversible, with the ability to repopulate B-cells from hematopoietic stem cells. Dual targeting CD20 and CD37 may improve the clinical efficacy and decrease drug resistance. PSB202 is a novel biological entity composed of two engineered monoclonal antibodies which are produced from a single stable CHO cell line - a humanized anti-CD20 antibody (PSB102) and a humanized anti-CD37 antibody (PSB107) at a 1:1 molecular ratio. <i>In vitro<\/i> binding studies demonstrated that PSB202 specifically binds to human CD20 and CD37. The antibodies&#8217; binding to Fc&#947;RIIIa was enhanced by reducing the fucose level on each antibody component. PSB202 directly induced potent autonomous killing via target engagement. PSB202 mediated depletion of human and monkey blood B-cells and malignant human B-cell lines through ADCC activity at EC<sub>50<\/sub> of double digit pM and CDC activity at EC<sub>50<\/sub> of low single digit nM. Importantly, PSB202 effectively depleted B-cells in <i>ex vivo<\/i> cultures of blood cells from CLL and NHL patients who were refractive to rituximab treatment. The antitumor activity of PSB202 was demonstrated in human xenograft models in mice. PSB202 was able to reduce different human lymphoma tumors by up to ~97.9% in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that PSB202 might be potentially efficacious against multiple types of B-cell malignancies. Synergy was demonstrated for PSB202 in combination with lenalidomide. Toxicokinetic assessment in cynomolgus monkeys showed a dose proportional exposure for both antibody components, with mean terminal elimination half-life (T<sub>1\/2<\/sub>) of ~60 and ~68 hours for the anti-CD20 and anti-CD37 component, respectively. PBS202 was well tolerated, with observed toxicities mostly related to its activity as a B-cell depletion agent. As expected, PSB202 when administered at &#8805; 10 mg\/kg resulted in nearly complete depletion of B lymphocytes 24 hours following the 1<sup>st<\/sup> dose. B-cells returned to near baseline within 2 months after the last dose at 10 mg\/kg. PSB202 can deplete normal and malignant B-cells by targeting two clinically validated targets through multiple distinct mechanisms including direct B-cell killing, enhanced ADCC activity, and CDC activity. PSB202 offers the potential to improve clinical efficacy, decrease drug resistance, provide administration convenience especially when combining with additional therapeutics, lower the cost for treatment, and reduce the unwanted side effects from chemotherapy. PSB202 is currently being evaluated in patients with previously treated, relapsed, indolent B-cell malignancies (NCT05003141).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e91472de-1652-4e48-a3a9-73f8e025b82b\/@A03B8ZGh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Antibody,CD20,CD37,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16936"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul Algate<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhi Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saying Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina Domeier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiming Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuanzhi Lao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanling Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William C.

To assess the complex mechanisms of action of ISB 1442 in a single system, a multiple mode of action of killing (MMoAK) assay was established to allow for simultaneous killing by natural killer cells, autologous macrophages, as well as complement from human serum. In the MMoAK assay, ISB 1442 exhibited tumor cell killing that was twice as high as daratumumab. <i>In vivo,<\/i> in a therapeutic model of subcutaneously established Raji tumor xenograft in CB17\/SCID mice, ISB 1442 induced higher tumor growth inhibition than daratumumab and comparable tumor regression to magrolimab. On-target specificity was evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> in human and monkey whole blood assays. ISB 1442 did not cause any detectable hemolysis, RBC depletion or platelet aggregation and showed markedly lower RBC hemagglutination relative to magrolimab, suggesting a more favorable on-target specificity profile in humans. On the contrary, due to the higher expression of CD38 in monkey RBC compared to human, ISB 1442 showed more pronounced binding on RBC than magrolimab, suggesting that monkey is a more sensitive species than human for toxicological evaluation of CD38-targeted therapies. Finally, by integrating in vitro pharmacology data along with available clinical information on benchmark antibodies, a quantitative systems pharmacology model was developed to simulate potential efficacious dose range in MM. In summary, we report a novel approach for the treatment for CD38+ cancers by co-targeting CD38 and CD47. Based on its unique design and multiple mechanisms of action, ISB 1442 is anticipated to enhance antitumor activity by overcoming known primary and acquired tumor escape mechanisms of resistance relative to daratumumab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03a012d6-7731-4d11-ac8d-ce58c0cf1b15\/@B03B8ZGi\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD38,CD47,Innate immunity,Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16937"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stefano Sammicheli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camille Grandclement<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elie Dheilly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Panagopoulou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evangelia Martini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Perrine Suere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Blandine Pouleau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carole Estoppey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Frei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Loyau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thierry Monney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Drake<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Rubod<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Agnes Doucey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vinu Menon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Venkatesha Udupa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunitha GN<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Rasmussen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeppe Koch Olsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto Gionannini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Girish Gudi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ankita Srivastava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cyril Konto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mario Perro<\/i><\/presenter>.

This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolytic conversion of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine (Ado) that suppresses tumor-infiltrating immune cells via the adenosine receptors, allowing tumors to escape the immune system. Here, we introduce a novel anti-human CD73 antibody called BP1200 that strongly blocks the generation of Ado by CD73 and thereby reverses immune suppression in tumors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We screened anti-CD73 antibodies by antigen-specific single B cell sorting from mice immunized with recombinant human CD73. CDRs of the antibodies that inhibit the enzyme activity of CD73 were engrafted into human IgG1 framework carrying the mutations of Fc silent. The proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells were analyzed using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence of ATP. Efficacy of BP1200 in vivo was investigated by using mice bearing human CD73 knock-in-MC38 cells and mice implanted with human NSCLC cell line (NCI-H292) and PBMC.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The humanized anti-CD73 antibody (BP1200) binds to both human and cynomolgus CD73 expressed on cell surface with KD value of 0.2 nM (human CD73). BP1200 blocked the hydrolysis of AMP by CD73 expressed as both membrane-bound and soluble form without the hook effect. BP1200 induced internalization of CD73 and remarkably decreased the cell surface CD73, indicating that BP1200 inhibits the enzyme activity as well as downregulates the protein level of CD73 at the cell surface. BP1200 induced in vitro proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity of T cells even in the presence of high level of ATP, suggesting that BP1200 enhances the T cell immunity in immunosuppressive tumor micro-envelopment (TME). In vivo studies showed that the combination treatment of BP1200 with anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 antibodies remarkably retarded tumor growth. Moreover, the mice administrated with BP1200 and anti-PD-1 exhibited long-term immune memory effects that rendered them resistant to rechallenge with tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The novel anti-human CD73 antibody, BP1200, ameliorates immunosuppressive TME caused by adenosine and enhances antitumor immune responses. The combination of BP1200 and immune-checkpoint inhibitors for cancer treatment will be a promising therapeutic option in clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2aa636a-b89b-4bbd-b91b-d270645d9583\/@B03B8ZGi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,CD73,Adenosine,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16939"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"ec5cf748-c024-4587-872b-09ef45b70b31","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec5cf748-c024-4587-872b-09ef45b70b31\/@B03B8ZGi\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Noriko Matsumoto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuji Mishima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshifumi Obonai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haruka Ban<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Motoya Mie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norihiro Nakamura<\/i><\/presenter>.

Interaction of ILT2 with its ligands, HLA-G and classical MHC class I molecules, is reported to impair cytotoxic activity of NK and effector T cells, attenuate B cell function, inhibit antigen-presentation by dendritic cells, and promote immunosuppressive activity of myeloid cells. Further, high ILT2 expression has been associated with poor prognosis in several human malignancies. As a result, ILT2 has been proposed as a therapeutic target to promote antitumor immunity and to overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade. Here, we report that AGEN1571, a fully human anti-ILT2 monoclonal IgG4&#954; antibody, reversed ILT2-mediated immunosuppression and promoted activation of NK, NKT, T cells, and myeloid cells in a series of preclinical studies.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>AGEN1571 binding to ILT2 was analyzed by SPR and flow cytometry. HDX-MS was used to identify the AGEN1571 binding epitope on ILT2. Mechanisms of AGEN1571-mediated modulation of immune cell function were evaluated using reporter cell lines and primary cell-based <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>ex vivo <\/i>assays.<br \/>Results: AGEN1571 bound to recombinant ILT2 with an approximate monovalent binding affinity of 0.38 nM and to cell-expressed ILT2 with an EC50 of 0.07 - 0.55 nM, depending on cell type and donor. AGEN1571 did not cross-react with related LILRA and LILRB family members except with weak reactivity to ILT4 (~370 nM). Consistent with its binding epitope, AGEN1571 potently blocked ILT2 binding to HLA-A, -B, -C, and -G and restored Fc&#947;R signaling inhibited by ILT2-HLA-G engagement in dose-dependent manner. AGEN1571 also augmented NF&#954;B and ISRE activation induced by TLR, Fc&#947;R, and STING agonists in myeloid cells, and promoted polarization of primary human macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. ILT2 blockade with AGEN1571 alone and in combination with a PD-1 antagonist enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of NK, NKT and CD8+ T cells in a PBMC tumor cell co-culture assay. AGEN1571 was designed to have minimal binding to Fc&#947;R and complement which has been confirmed by lack of Fc&#947;R signaling and complement cascade induction <i>in vitro<\/i>. An <i>in silico <\/i>T cell epitope screen predicted AGEN1571 to be non-immunogenic, while AGEN1571 showed no evidence of inducing systemic cytokine release in a cytokine release assay using whole blood and PBMC cultures.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>AGEN1571 is a novel high-affinity ILT2 antagonist antibody that effectively antagonizes ILT2 to enhance T cell, NK cell, NKT cell, and myeloid activity. These data support clinical development of AGEN1571 as a therapeutic agent for patients with solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7528b637-a57e-41cf-8fb2-bca3bdbd180b\/@B03B8ZGi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Monoclonal antibodies,Immuno-oncology,Checkpoint Inhibitors,HLA class I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16941"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Olga Udartseva<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malgorzata Pupecka-Swider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pilar Garcia-Broncano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naxin Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Spencer Campbell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Klakus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Ward<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priyadarshini Iyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Brittsan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beth Wensley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Morin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Slee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhan Chand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claire Galand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Ignatovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emmanuel Briend<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Savitsky<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) is a promising therapeutic strategy for tumor immunotherapy. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2) is highly expressed on Treg cells and is a potential target for anti-tumor therapy. A TNFR2 non-blocking antibody (1C3) was generated from humanized IgG mice (RenMice), which is an effective platform for human antibody generation. 1C3 was selected from a large panel of antibody candidates through an unbiased, high-throughput in vivo efficacy screen in syngeneic tumor mouse models in humanized TNFR2 mice. Compared with other TNFR2 antagonistic antibodies, 1C3 effectively promoted the proliferation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in vitro, a population that is inhibited by Treg cells. To evaluate 1C3 efficacy and safety in vivo, syngeneic mouse tumor models were established. 1C3 monotherapy significantly inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner in syngeneic tumor mouse models in TNFR2 humanized mice. In combination with anti-human PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody, 1C3 also greatly increased antitumor activity compared to the monotherapy of each therapeutic agent. Mechanistically, 1C3 treatment significantly increased the ratio of Teff\/Treg in the TME. In addition, 1C3 was well tolerated in TNFR2 humanized mice, and no side effects were observed even when the dose was increased to 100 mg\/kg. Taken together, our data demonstrates that 1C3 is a novel anti-TNFR2 antibody for anti-tumor therapy and provides a great potential for the next generation of immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0074cf51-4ecc-4b47-8e4e-3f840e8b670d\/@B03B8ZGi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Animal models,Antibody,Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16942"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yongfei Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuzhen Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhe Shao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xueyuan Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingya Duan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maopeng Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sen Mei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Luke (Zhaoxue) Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

While SCLC initially responds well to standard chemotherapy treatment, chemotherapy-resistant recurrence is characteristic and available treatment options for recurrent and refractory diseases are limited. Immunotherapy as an alternative or additional treatment has been very successful in treating many cancers, yet it has shown disappointingly limited benefits in SCLC and notable treatment related toxicities have been observed. Delta like 3 (DLL3) is an attractive target for SCLC immunotherapy, as its expression is highly restricted to SCLC and can therefore be used for targeting purposes. On the other hand, CD47 is also strongly expressed on the surface of SCLC cells, where it inhibits macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing. We have developed PT217, a DLL3\/CD47 bispecific antibody with effector effect competent Fc to specifically target SCLC cells via two mechanisms. First, PT217 blocks the CD47-SIRP&#945; interaction and stimulates phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophage. Second, PT217 exhibits robust effector effect (ADCC by NK cells and ADPC by macrophage) mediated by the functional Fc of PT217. Interestingly, it appears that the tumor cells targeted by NK cells are subsequently engulfed by macrophage. Elevated phagocytosis of the tumor cells by macrophages and dendritic cells is expected to increase the presentation of tumor neoantigens that may eventually lead to T cell-mediated killing of tumor cells that do not expression DLL3. <i>In vivo<\/i>, PT217 demonstrated tumor suppression activity in xenograft mouse models. In addition to the strong tumor killing activity, PT217 also demonstrated good safety profile in NHP studies. Furthermore, PT217 exhibits regular mAb-like manufacturability in process development and CMC. We expect to initiate a phase 1 trial to target SCLC in the first half of 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/722e2825-9a9c-4097-a732-fe0a659561dd\/@B03B8ZGi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Bispecific antibody,Immune therapy,CD47\/DLL3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16943"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Haiqun(John) Jia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dorthy Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Molly Lobsinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Long<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albert Lam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangyang Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaisa Selesniemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Hui Zou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Although treatments like chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplantation and new biotherapies improve the survival of patients, relapse is common and may be due to residual leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Since LSCs express high levels of CD123 (interleukin-3 receptor), CD123 represents an attractive target for relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) AML patients. Here, the expression of CD123 on leukemic cells and LSCs from fresh AML patient samples was confirmed, with a similar receptor density ranging from 350 to 12,500 and from 1,200 to 29,000 sites per cell, respectively. Also, the cytotoxic activity of the bispecific T-cell engager (TCE) CD123-CODV-TCE (that binds to CD3 on T cells and CD123 on blast cells) against primary blast cells isolated from the blood of 30 AML patients was evaluated. CD123-CODV-TCE induced high killing of AML blast cells with both high and low CD123 antigen density (from 298 to 18,719 sites per cell). The Effector: Target (E:T) ratio was highly variable among all patients, ranging from less than 1 to more than 100 blast cells for one T cell, and did not impact the activity of CD123-CODV-TCE. Since cytokine release syndrome is associated with TCE therapies, the release of proinflammatory cytokines was monitored in parallel to cytotoxicity. CD123-CODV-TCE induced the release of all tested cytokines (IL-6, IFN&#947;, TNF&#945; and IL-8) without clear correlation with blast killing efficacy level. Since a similar CD123 expression pattern in human and cynomolgus monkey tissues was found, and CD123-CODV-TCE binds to human and cynomolgus CD3&#949; and CD123, non-human primates were used for the evaluation of pharmacodynamic effects and safety. A repeat-dose monkey study was performed using a progressive, weekly (X4) intra-monkey dose escalation scheme. The depletion of CD123 positive cells in blood was evidenced from the lowest dose tested (0.1 &#956;g\/kg) to the highest (5 &#181;g\/kg) with no adverse effects observed at 0.1 &#181;g\/kg. The main adverse effect consisted of a marked increase of the level of cytokines at 5 hours following compound administration at 1 &#956;g\/kg and above. Importantly, following the dose-escalation scheme 0.1\/1\/3\/3 &#181;g\/kg, only limited cytokine release after the 4<sup>th<\/sup> administration was observed, suggesting that mitigation of cytokine release can be obtained by progressive intra-monkey dose escalation. Taken together, these results indicate that CD123-CODV-TCE leads to potent and specific leukemic cancer cell killing independently of CD123 receptor density and E:T ratio, and that studies monitoring cytokine release in monkeys can be useful for future clinical development of TCEs in the setting of R\/R AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/704e994c-ccd0-48d3-a7a8-c72e3aecfa6b\/@B03B8ZGi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Cancer immunotherapy,T cell engager,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16945"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Helene Bonnevaux<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqueline Courta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wilfried Passe-Coutrin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Laure Bauchet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annelies Roobrouck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Celine Amara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Beys<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marielle Balzano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxime Moulard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Meloni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Dullaers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marielle Chiron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Virone-Oddos<\/i><\/presenter>.

We developed a very stable anti-CD79b-MMAE ADC with this technology showing a higher therapeutic index compared to polatuzumab-vedotin in preclinical models. Our ADC may represent a safe and efficacious alternative for the treatment of patients with diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Using native polatuzumab (non-engineered, same antibody sequence as present in approved polatuzumab-vedotin) as the targeting antibody and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) as payload, we generated within 24hours highly homogeneous and pure ADCs with a well-defined drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 1.9, with a &#38;gt 98% monomer content. The ADC is highly stable under stressed conditions at elevated temperatures and maintains the FcyR\/FcRn-binding properties of the parental mAb. In <i>in-vitro<\/i> assays our ADC demonstrated potent cytotoxicity in four tested cell-lines, similar to the approved polatuzumab-vedotin (Polivy&#174;) . Moreover, our anti-CD79b ADC (ARADC) is highly stable in mouse, cynomolgus and human sera exemplified by the absence of payload deconjugation or linker cleavage. Though highly stable, the ADC is still efficiently released by lysosomal human Cathepsin B cleavage or human liver-lysosome enzymes. Most importantly, the resulting ADC is extremely stable in circulation as shown in pharmacokinetic studies in mice and rats demonstrating an antibody-like exposure profile comparable to the unmodified polatuzumab antibody and twice as long as the approved polatuzumab-vedotin (half-life 10d vs 5d).Most importantly, the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of ARADC (DAR 1.9) was compared with approved polatuzumab-vedotin (DAR 3.5) in two CD79b-expressing tumor models: Granta-519 and Ramos. ARADC provided equal tumor growth inhibition and survival at about half the payload dose relative to polatuzumab-vedotin in both models. At approximately equal payload doses, ARADC treatment led to greater antitumor effects and a considerably longer survival advantage over polatuzumab-vedotin in both models. Finally, the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) of ARADC was determined at 30mg\/kg in a 4-week repeat dose toxicology study in rats. This observation, together with the high anti-tumor potency at low dose - the minimal effective dose (MED), results in an overall 4-6-fold increased therapeutic index (TI).These encouraging results obtained so far indicate that ARADC a) has very favorable biophysical properties, b) shows a clearly defined drug-to-antibody ratio, c) is highly stable <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, d) is highly potent and efficacious in multiple tumor models and e) showed an improvement in TI by a factor of 4-6 and ultimately warrant further development of ARADC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0a0269b-f384-4f10-9ae5-010fdb60d2be\/@B03B8ZGi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),CD79b,Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL),B-cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16946"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isabella Attinger-Toller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Probst<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Romain Bertrand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramona Stark<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roger Santimaria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Renard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachael Fay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dragan Grabulovski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernd Schlereth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp RenÃ© Spycher<\/i><\/presenter>.

We are developing the ISAC BDC-2034 to target the tumor antigen, CEA (CEACAM5), which is expressed in many solid tumors. BDC-2034 comprises our proprietary antibody, CEA1, covalently conjugated to a potent TLR7\/8 agonist via a non-cleavable linker. The strong pro-phagocytic capacity and slow internalization rate of CEA1 makes it an ideal antibody for the ISAC approach.<br \/>Methods: The ability of BDC-2034 to induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines was evaluated in vitro using co-cultures of tumor cells and primary immune cells (including monocytes and dendritic cells). Anti-tumor efficacy was demonstrated in vivo with xenograft and syngeneic mouse tumor models. In parallel studies, the mechanism of BDC-2034 action was assessed by quantifying intratumoral immune infiltration, cytokine levels, and transcript profile.<br \/>Results: In co-cultures of CEA-expressing tumor cells and immune cells, BDC-2034 induced the secretion of cytokines and chemokines that are essential for a broad anti-tumor immune response, including IL-12p70, CXCL10, and TNF&#945;. These effects were accompanied by myeloid cell activation as demonstrated by elevation in costimulatory surface markers such as CD40. In vivo, BDC-2034 inhibited tumor growth in multiple xenograft and syngeneic mouse tumor models having CEA expression comparable to human cancers. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, BDC-2034 induced intratumoral immune cell infiltration, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and myeloid re-programming in a dose-dependent and CEA-dependent fashion. The constellation of BDC-2034 effects translated to durable therapeutic activity.<br \/>Conclusions: These preclinical findings demonstrate the potential of BDC-2034 to generate anti-tumor activity in CEA-expressing cancers through direct innate immune activation and the induction of adaptive anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/edb1cd06-5d9d-4b64-86dc-46f4b11d858b\/@B03B8ZGi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carcinoembryonic antigen,Antigen presentation,Phagocytosis,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16947"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lisa K.

A variety of factors may be contributing to this lack of success in the solid tumor setting, including insufficient exposure of tumor cells to these targeted therapeutics due to target-independent interactions with peripheral T cells. Not only can circulating cells act as a sink for CD3 bispecifics but these interactions can lead to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a common and dose-limiting toxicity for this class of therapeutics. We have developed a CD3 bispecific platform, CONTRA-MAB&#174; (<u>Con<\/u>strained <u>T<\/u> Cell <u>R<\/u>edirecting and <u>A<\/u>ctivating <u>M<\/u>ultispecific <u>A<\/u>nti<u>b<\/u>ody), that combines high-affinity tumor-associated antigen binding single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) with a constrained CD3-targeting V<sub>H<\/sub>\/V<sub>L<\/sub> pair that has been strategically positioned and affinity engineered to minimize T cell activation and cytokine production in the absence of target antigen engagement. INBRX-130 is a CONTRA-MAB&#174; that targets trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG; 5T4), a cell-surface protein that is upregulated across many solid tumor indications but has restricted expression on normal adult tissues. As determined by flow cytometry, INBRX-130 exhibits specific and high-affinity binding to 5T4-positive cells but shows no detectable binding to T cells, absent target, at concentrations up to one micromolar. Additionally, treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with high concentration INBRX-130 does not result in production of detectable levels of CRS-associated inflammatory cytokines. Upon binding to 5T4-expressing tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, INBRX-130 potently induces T cell activation, proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity, resulting in target cell death. INBRX-130 has favorable pharmacokinetic properties and the capacity to effect regression of 5T4+ tumors in humanized mice, even in models that display minimal initial T-cell infiltrate. INBRX-130 is well-tolerated by cynomolgus monkeys at the maximally administered dose of 2 mg\/kg without the requirement of a priming dose. Preliminary <i>in vitro <\/i>data with CONTRA-MABs&#174; targeting other solid tumor antigens supports the broad applicability of this unique T cell engager platform. CONTRA-MABs&#174; have the potential to have enhanced accumulation in solid tumors relative to other CD3 bispecific antibodies as a result of reduced systemic engagement of T cells and increased tolerability at high doses. These attributes, coupled with the broad tumor biased expression of 5T4 across solid tumors, may enable INBRX-130 to have a greater therapeutic index and provide a significant benefit to patients in need.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/57bf0689-6be0-40fe-b2a2-f06337dbe2bd\/@B03B8ZGi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,5T4,Bispecific antibody,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16948"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katelyn M.

Despite recent advances in therapy, clinical outcomes remain poor and there is a great unmet need for newer therapies for ovarian cancer patients. Bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) consist of two single chain variable fragments (scFVs) linked via a peptide linker and are being studied as a tool against many different cancers. BiTEs redirect T cell activity towards tumor cells in an MHC independent manner by bringing T cells close to a tumor associated antigen (TAA). A BiTE targeting CD19 has been approved for treating ALL, however the success of BiTEs in treating solid tumor remains limited. Two reasons that reduce the efficacy of BiTEs in solid tumors are 1) their short half-life which drastically reduces their availability 2) tumor heterogeneity preventing targeting by a single BiTE. Tumors downregulate TAA expression in response to targeted therapy allowing treatment escape. Development of novel BiTEs with longer serum half-lives and <i>in vivo<\/i> delivery strategies which allow rapid customization of BiTEs is important. Here we describe a strategy for <i>in vivo<\/i> assembly using the Knob-in-hole (KIH) approach. We designed two different DNA encoded KIH (dKIH), targeting Her2 and FSHR, and studied their ability to be assembled <i>in vivo<\/i> into functional therapeutics. The knobs encoded full length antibodies engineered to target either Her2 or FSHR. We designed a third construct as the hole to target CD3. Following <i>in vitro<\/i> characterization, we injected NSG mice with KIH pairs for Her2+CD3 or FSHR+ CD3 and studied their expression and function. Sera from mice injected with Her2 or FSHR dKIH bound tumor cells expressing Her2 or FSHR respectively. Sera from mice from both groups also bound to T cells. We observed that both dKIH resulted in mouse sera with high potency (pg level) killing of ovarian cancer cell lines expressing Her2 and FSHR in an <i>in vitro<\/i> killing assay. A single injection of either dKIH allowed for <i>in vivo <\/i>expression and tumor killing for over a month post injection which is a significant improvement over delivery of protein KIH. This study demonstrates the potential of <i>in vivo<\/i> assembly of KIH. The patients produce their own therapy, which allows to skip complex bioprocessing steps and makes KIH delivery simpler and cheaper. This study illustrates the potential to improve immunotherapy outcomes for ovarian cancer patients via <i>in vivo<\/i> assembly of multiple BiTEs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b229ab23-9bc0-43bb-8d33-228c2a82fff1\/@C03B8ZGj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Bispecific antibody,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16949"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pratik Sanjivkumar Bhojnagarwala<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Raza Ali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Drew Frase<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhijeet Kulkarni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Devivasha Bordoloi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David B.

V&#948;1 T cells are the most abundant &#947;&#948; T cells in epithelial tissues including the gut and skin and form a significant proportion of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a number of solid tumour indications. Tissue-resident cytotoxic V&#948;1 &#947;&#948; T cells are of particular interest in immunotherapy approaches for their role in recognising and eradicating cancer cells, providing new avenues for antibody tissue-based immunological intervention. V&#948;1 &#947;&#948; T cells combine features of innate and adaptive immunity: in contrast to &#945;&#946; T cells that rely on antigen-presentation via MHC, &#947;&#948; T cells recognize and kill transformed cells by direct recognition of a pattern of stress associated ligands expressed on their surface, opening up a potential range of cold tumours with decreased or impaired tumour antigen presentation. Adaptate&#8217;s first-in-class approach is to harness the specific anti-tumour properties of V&#948;1 T cells using activating immunomodulatory antibodies.<br \/>Methods: Adaptate&#8217;s ADT-010 is a first-in-class, fully human, monoclonal antibody which selectively recognizes and binds to the V&#948;1 TCR leading to V&#948;1 T cell activation. ADT-010 was selected via high-stringency antigen binding using a human phage display library. To elucidate its mechanism of action, the binding and functional activity of ADT-010 was evaluated on expanded skin-derived V&#948;1 T cells in vitro.<br \/>Results: ADT-010 specifically enhanced the V&#948;1 killing of cancer cells whilst sparing healthy non-diseased cells. The functional activity of ADT-010 on expanded skin-derived V&#948;1 T cells was investigated in the presence or absence of tumour cells. ADT-010 mediated activation of V&#948;1 T cells in the presence of target tumour cells was demonstrated through TCR downregulation, CD107a and CD25 upregulation, and enhanced anti-tumour cytotoxicity. Taken together the data indicates that V&#948;1 TCR engagement on &#947;&#948; T cells by ADT-010 results in their full activation and enhanced cytotoxicity only in the presence of target tumour cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Despite recent advances in immune therapies in oncology, there currently remains a significant unmet need for effective and safe treatments for solid tumours. The challenges of treating such tumours which include infiltration into the tumour tissue and discrimination between healthy and tumour cells have the potential to be addressed by novel approaches such as Adaptate&#8217;s ADT-010 antibody. ADT-010 specifically activates a population of tumour-resident V&#948;1 T cells that can then orchestrate a potent and highly selective anti-tumour response through direct killing.Adaptate&#8217;s first-in-class ADT-010 is being progressed to the clinic for the treatment of solid tumour indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gamma-delta lymphocytes,Immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Cytotoxic T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21552"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jose Munoz-Olaya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aoife McGinley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Foxler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Samuel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanguy Lechertier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shefali Bhumbra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Good<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luke Cave<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oxana Polyakova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Uden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mihriban Tuna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Mount<\/i><\/presenter>.

Analogously, a novel class of immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs) has recently emerged to achieve tumor-targeted activation of anti-tumor immune responses, avoiding dose-limiting immunotoxicities seen with the systemic immune agonist delivery. Most of the ADC or ISAC to date utilize random payload conjugation to native surface-exposed lysines or cysteines, and relatively labile linkage chemistries, leading to conjugation site and drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) heterogeneity, and ADC\/ISAC instability in systemic circulation. In particular, the presence of high-DAR species and linker instability can lead to off-tumor toxicity, thus limiting the therapeutic window. Here we describe the generation and preclinical characterization of a site-specific TLR7-agonist (TLR7a) ISAC targeting an undisclosed TAA1. To specify the conjugation site and DAR, a non-natural amino acid (nnAA), para-acetyl-L-phenylalanine (pAF) was genetically incorporated at defined sites within the anti-TAA1 antibody, providing an orthogonal chemical handle for covalent TLR7 agonist payload conjugation through a highly stable oxime bond. Using this site-specific, homogenous ISAC platform, we systematically screened different conjugate sites and TLR7 agonist payloads to obtain an optimized TAA1-TLR7a ISAC drug candidate. ISAC platform stability, homogeneity, and flexibility were critical, because conjugation site and payload structure dramatically influenced ISAC <i>in vitro<\/i> activity, PK profile and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy. Using <i>in vitro<\/i> co-culture assays with human immune cells and tumor cell lines, we showed that the optimized TAA1 ISAC can induce multiple anti-tumor immune mechanisms, including proinflammatory cytokine production, the myeloid cell activation markers induction and enhanced ADCC mediated tumor cell killing. The TAA1 ISAC is 100-fold more active than the free, unconjugated TLR7 agonist, and all activity is conditional on the presence of TAA1-expressing tumor cells. Finally, we demonstrated <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in both xenograft and syngeneic tumor models. In a syngeneic MC38-tumor model expressing human TAA1, ISAC treatment led to complete tumor regression and formation of immunologic memory. These results provide a strong rationale for site-specific TLR7 agonist ISAC as a next generation platform for tumor-targeted, innate immune agonist immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),TLR7,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21768"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mingchao Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung-Ju Moon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andy Beck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Molly Allen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Nelson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keith Tatsukawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hon Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manoj Pal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Gray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nick Knudsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lillian Skidmore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>David Mills<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingchun Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Buechler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sukumar Sakamuri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shawn Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Tian<\/i><\/presenter>.
