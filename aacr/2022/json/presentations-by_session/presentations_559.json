[{"Abstract":"[Purpose] In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) which is characterized by an intense desmoplastic feature, the extracellular matrix (ECM) can significantly influence the tumor microenvironment (TME). Hyaluronan (HA), a major component of ECM, is associated with elevated tumor pressure, vascular collapse, and poor perfusion in TME, conferring hypoxia. HA expression is also correlated with poor prognosis in the patients with PDAC. PEGylated human hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) enzymatically depletes hyaluronan in tumors. The resultant improvement in vascular patency and blood perfusion is expected to increase the delivery of therapeutic molecules. The aim of this study was to investigate the change in physiologic and metabolic profile of the tumor in response to treatment with PEGPH20 using multi-modal imaging techniques. We also investigated the capability of PEGPH20 to enhance treatment effect of radiation. [Methods] Athymic nude mice were inoculated with BxPC3 (human pancreatic adenocarcinoma) tumor cells transduced with hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) to the right tibial periosteum. BxPC3-HAS3 tumor treated with PEGPH20 or control buffer were scanned with Electron paramagnetic Resonance imaging (EPRI), dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) MRI, Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), and Hyperpolarized <sup>13<\/sup>C-MRI using [1-<sup>13<\/sup>C] pyruvate to evaluate intratumor pO<sub>2<\/sub>, intratumor perfusion, blood volume, O<sub>2<\/sub> saturation, and glycolysis, respectively. [Results] EPRI showed significantly increased pO<sub>2<\/sub> in PEGPH20 treated group. DCE-MRI and USPIO-MRI showed improved perfusion\/permeability and local blood volume, respectively after PEGPH20 treatment, accounting for the increase in tumor oxygenation. PAI provided the evidence of immediate changes in tumor oxygenation after treatment. Hyperpolarized <sup>13<\/sup>C-MRI using [1-<sup>13<\/sup>C] pyruvate suggested the decreased glycolytic flux evaluated by lactate\/pyruvate ratio after PEGPH20 treatment. Combination of radiotherapy and PEGPH20 synergistically delayed tumor progression and prolonged the survival. [Conclusions] This study examined the effect of PEGPH20 on TME in PDAC xenograft model by using non-invasive multimodal imaging techniques. In summary, the non-invasive imaging modalities were useful in evaluating the changes in hemodynamics and metabolism in TME induced by modulation of ECM such as PEGPH20 treatment. PEGPH20 enhanced treatment effect of radiation therapy. The results validated the utility of the imaging methods to non-invasively monitor the changes in TME and predicted the radiosensitizing effect of hyaluronan depletion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ba75f4ea-b009-4abf-887e-77e069fed67c\/@s03B8ZTW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-03 Imaging in animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hyaluronan,Imaging,Pancreatic cancer,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18054"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yu Saida<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomohiro Seki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shun Kishimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey R.

Segmentectomy is a minimal resection surgery required for elderly patients or small sized early-stage lung cancer patients, in which accurate detection of tumor margins with simultaneous identification of the lung intersegment plane is the key to success. However, non-small cell lung cancer is difficult to detect intraoperatively, and the identification of intersegmental plane is challenging during minimal resection surgery. Here, we report dual-channel image-guided lung cancer surgery using renal clearable and physiochemically stable targeted fluorophores to visualize the tumor margins and intersegmental plane separately with different colors but simultaneously: cRGD-ZW800-PEG (800 nm channel) allows for tumor-specific targeting and ZW700-1C (700 nm channel) for discrimination of segmental planes. Armed with the dual-channel imaging, image-guided surgery enables complete tumor resection with minimal negative margins that can reduce the recurrence rate and increase the survival rate of lung cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f814c105-c4d1-47b8-b5b4-9b5c1196e5c0\/@s03B8ZTW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-08 New targets for imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18055"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yu Hua Quan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Bao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyungsu Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haoran Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shinya Yokomizo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>G.

ICAM-1 is highly expressed in inflammatory conditions, chronic diseases and several cancers, like anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This rationale has motivated the pursuit of ICAM-1 as an emerging Immuno-Onco target, with many groups developing adoptive cell therapies against ICAM-1. Visualizing the ICAM-1 expression in the patients noninvasively is critical for a successful treatment. Identifying the ideal candidate patient, track the therapeutic effect of these treatments, the changes implicated in these diseases, or even after therapy for efficacy. PET imaging would be ideal due to its quantifiability, but unfortunately so far there is no such PET tracer to image ICAM-1 in patients. Here, we developed a nanobody based PET platform to image ICAM-1. Nanobodies are the smallest known functional antibody fragment. They are derived from heavy-chain only antibodies (HcAbs) in camelids. They retain high affinity and specificity for their target antigens, with low off-target accumulation due to their hydrophilic properties. Their nanoscale dimensions enable deep penetration of tumors, tolerance of high temperatures, elevated pressures, non-physiological pH, and even strong chemical denaturants. We generated these nanobodies by immunizing alpaca with Fc-fused human ICAM-1, produced and purified from mammalian cell transfection media. The harvested B cells from these immunized alpaca were used to generate a cDNA library, containing transcripts of the VHH domain of the HcAbs. This cDNA library was subsequently cloned into a yeast-surface display platform. After three rounds of panning we screened 160+ ICAM-1 binding clones from which we identified 8 unique clones with high to moderate binding to ICAM-1. Among which, clone A7 was utilized for nanobody-PET due to its high affinity (~115nM) and specificity to ICAM-1. With the goal of having a nanobody-PET that would be easy to execute at a moment&#8217;s notice and translated into clinic, we decided to utilize NOTA\/aluminum-fluoride chemistry to radio label our PET tracer. For consistency in labeling, we utilized sortase to label the nanobody with NOTA at a 1:1 ratio. We demonstrated the utility of this ICAM-1 nanobody-PET tracer in subcutaneous tumor mouse xenograft model. PET\/CT imaging shows clear localization to ICAM-1-positive xenograft, with low background uptake apart from minor gallbladder and kidney clearance. The success of this tracer in conjunction with the ease of NOTA\/aluminum-fluoride chemistry opens up the possibility to carry over nanobody-PET to other targets (e.g., MSLN, EpCAM).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/210a6693-8daf-4cda-b7bb-3b3523e936fd\/@s03B8ZTW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-08 New targets for imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PET,Antibody,In vivo imaging,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18056"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yogindra Vedvyas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Gonzalez-Valdivieso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yago Alcaina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanping Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moonsoo M.

The leaky and compressed vessels in the tumor lead to impaired blood flow and oxygen delivery and cause hypoxia. Significant tumor hypoxia exists in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is closely associated with radiation-resistant and poor survival. Recently, we have identified a new class of antitumor drugs, cyclopamine tartrate (CycT) and heme-sequestering peptide 2 (HeSP2). They are heme-targeting agents that effectively inhibit NSCLC oxidative metabolism, oxygen consumption, and ATP generation, which lead to the suppression of tumor progression. By using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), an advanced noninvasive imaging modality that monitors the changes in blood oxygen saturation and vascular function in real-time, we observed the effect of heme-targeting agents in normalizing tumor vasculature and alleviating tumor hypoxia. To investigate the impact of heme-targeting agent on mediating the lung cancer radiotherapy response, we characterized the vasculature and antigenic profile of NSCLC growth during the treatment of CycT in combination with radiotherapy by performing MSOT, together with other imaging approaches including bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We demonstrated that the heme-targeting agents increased tumor radiation sensitivity by regulating tumor vasculature and oxygenation. Our novel combination therapy can be a powerful strategy in improving the treatment of lung cancer and potentially other radiation-resistant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4c582940-c2b5-46b3-8180-e1d33e773523\/@s03B8ZTW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-04 Imaging of molecular and cellular events in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography,Radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18387"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tianyuan Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hashini Wanniarachchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorena Arango<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

This diverse response can be attributed in-part to heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, affecting therapeutic delivery and efficacy. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to spatially resolve intratumoral heterogeneity into distinct tumor subregions, or habitats. We investigated whether MRI-derived tumor habitats identified prior to initiation of NAC were predictive of pathological response in TNBC patients.<br \/>Methods: Women with stage II\/III TNBC who received a pre-treatment (baseline) breast MRI and NAC at our institution (2012-2019) were retrospectively identified. Pathological response was determined at surgery, with pCR defined as no residual tumor within the breast or lymph nodes. Both diffusion-weighted (DW) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data were collected prior to initiation of NAC. The apparent diffusion coefficient (a measure of cell density) was calculated for each voxel from DW-MRI. Signal enhancement ratio, percent enhancement, and wash-out slope were calculated for each voxel from DCE-MRI, providing measures of vascularity. Hierarchical clustering of voxel data was used to identify tumor habitats, with each subregion labeled in terms of &#8220;high&#8221; or &#8220;low&#8221; vascularity and cellularity based on mean parameter values for the subregion. Tumor composition was quantified as percent tumor volume comprised by each habitat. Differences between pCR and non-pCR patients were assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum test, with p&#60;0.05 considered significant.<br \/>Results: 46 women with TNBC were retrospectively identified (median age: 48, range 31-77 yrs), of which 14 (30%) achieved pCR. No significant differences between pCR and non-pCR patients were observed in baseline tumor volume or longest diameter (p&#62;0.05). Clustering analysis yielded four tumor habitats: low-vascularity low-cellularity (LV-LC), low-vascularity high-cellularity (LV-HC), high-vascularity low-cellularity (HV-LC), and high-vascularity high-cellularity (HV-HC). Patients who achieved pCR had significantly higher fraction of the HV-HC habitat at baseline (p=0.02). No significant differences were observed for other habitats.<br \/>Discussion &#38; Conclusion: Our findings suggest multiparametric MRI can identify physiologically-distinct tumor habitats prior to NAC, which are predictive of response. A higher fraction of HV-HC habitat was associated with pCR, potentially suggestive of increased therapeutic delivery\/sensitivity. Clinical translation of this approach would enable more specific characterizations of tumor heterogeneity and prediction of response, which could aid in personalizing regimens for optimal outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/edafae2b-7b8e-4a5a-856a-66fd68ea476b\/@s03B8ZTW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-02 Application of imaging technology to the clinic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Heterogeneity,Magnetic resonance imaging,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18388"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anum S.

The local level of oxygen experienced by a cell will determine its response, making it critical to understand tissue oxygen levels with a spatial resolution on the order of the size of a cell. While microenvironment normalization strategies alleviate global hypoxia, how local oxygen levels change are not known because there are no in vivo techniques to longitudinally assess tumor vessels and interstitial oxygen in tumors with sufficient resolution. Understanding the heterogeneity of oxygen levels after microenvironmental normalization will help improve the efficacy of various normalization strategies.<br \/>Experimental Design: We developed a multiphoton phosphorescence quenching microscopy system using a low-molecular weight palladium porphyrin probe to measure perfused vessels, oxygen tension and their spatial correlations in vivo in mouse skin, bone marrow, and tumors. Further, we measured the temporal and spatial changes in oxygen and vessel perfusion in tumors in response to microenvironmental normalization.<br \/>Results: We found that vessel function was highly dependent on tumor type. Although some tumors had vessels with greater oxygen carrying ability than normal skin, most tumors had inefficient vessels. Further, inter-vessel heterogeneity in tumors coincided with heterogeneous response to microenvironmental normalizing agents. Using both vascular and stromal normalizing agents, we show that spatial heterogeneity in oxygen levels persist, even with global reductions in hypoxia.<br \/>Conclusions: We present the first study to examine the high-resolution spatial and temporal response of tumor vessels to two agents known to improve vascular perfusion globally. Our measurements demonstrate that the heterogeneities in the local imbalance of pro- and anti-angiogenic signaling lead to spatially heterogeneous changes in vessel structure and function. Microscale dynamic vascular changes should be considered in optimizing the dose and schedule of microenvironment normalizing therapies to improve function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7971050a-0996-4fba-8110-d33a6c18b256\/@s03B8ZTW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-04 Imaging of molecular and cellular events in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Hypoxia,Imaging,Angiogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20459"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John Martin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Lanning<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dai Fukumura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Padera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakesh Jain<\/i><\/presenter>.
