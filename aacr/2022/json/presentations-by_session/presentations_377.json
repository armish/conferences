[{"Abstract":"Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy is reported as a fifth pillar of cancer therapy. CAR-T therapy has success against DLBCL&#8217;s. Although it is an effective cancer treatment, CAR-T cells still faces challenges like persistence, exhaustion and its leaky entry into the organs causes off-target tissue destruction. Genetic modifications and the use of ectopic stimulants have showed promising way to increase the persistence and decreases the exhaustion. However, most of these modifications either increase persistence or decrease the exhaustion but does not limit its leaky migration to tissues. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) is a mucin-like selectin counterreceptor on T-cells that binds to P-selectin, E-selectin, and L-selectin on endothelial cells.In our study, we observed CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of P-Selectin Glycoprotein Ligand-1(PSGL-1)in human Pan-T cells showed increased persistence by enhancing the anti-apoptotic pathway and further reduces the exhaustion by reduced expression of PD-1, TIM3 and LAG3. Interestingly, knocking out PSGL-1 in CD19-CAR-T cells impaired its ability to migrate into tissues. Moreover, CD19-CAR-T cells didn&#8217;t lose their cytotoxicity upon Knock out of PSGL-1. Hence PSGL-1 can be used as a potential target in the reprogramming of CAR T-cells and successful CAR T-cell therapy might be achieved with a smaller number of infusions to the patients. Our preclinical study in B6 mouse model, pre-B-ALL disease model clearly shows PSGL-1 KO CD19-CAR-T cells, effectively clears the tumors, persist for longer time by maintain the central memory phenotype and having lower exhaustion profile. KEGG and GSEA pathway enrichment analysis from RNAseq of PSGL-1 KO CD19 CAR-T cells shows PSGL-1 KO CD19-CAR-T cells has central memory phenotype and lower exhaustion profile, further confirmed by immunophenotyping these PSGL1-KO CD19-CAR-T cells. IHC study clearly shows migration of CD19-CAR-T cells into different organs significantly reduced, which limits or reduce the cytokine storm, neurotoxicity and tissue destruction. Recent literature shows VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation) as a ligand for the PSGL-1, and most of the solid tumors express VISTA and its high level of expression related poor immunotherapeutic outcome and lower survival percentage. From our study, it is evident that PSGL-1 KO CAR-T cells can overcome the limitations of CAR-T cells hurdles like maintaining the memory phenotype, exhaustion and leakiness into different organs, more overPSGL-1 KO CAR-T cells can over comes VISTA dependent CAR-T cell functional inhibition. In summary, our study is clear evident that PSGL-1 KO CAR-T cells can be used as universal CAR-T system to target all kind tumors not limiting to hematological cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,PSGL-1,CAR-T cell,Cancer Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16695"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jayadev Mavuluri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajsekhar Alli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsay Jones<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite standard therapies, more than 50% of patients experience relapse, eventually with metastatic disease. The CRC microenvironment is densely infiltrated by T-cells, which presence correlates with improved overall survival, thus sustaining the rational for immunotherapy. Here, we paired high-dimensional flow cytometry, bulk RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to describe the phenotype and the exhaustion status of T-cells infiltrating primary and metastatic CRC. Analysis of the healthy, peritumoral and neoplastic tissues of treatment-na&#239;ve primary CRCs and of the peritumoral and tumoral tissues of CRC patients undergoing surgery for liver metastasis, revealed extensive transcriptional and spatial remodeling across tumors. Unsupervised analysis of flow cytometry data performed by an advanced pipeline of data handling by dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms allowed the definition of a peculiar inhibitory receptors signature on TILs enriched both in primary CRCs and liver metastases. Of note, CD39 was upregulated in both the signatures retrieved from primary and metastatic CRC, thus suggesting its relevance as molecular target for T-cells engineering. By CRISPR\/Cas9 we disrupted the CD39 gene in T cells with &#62;80% efficiency. We combined CD39 knock-out with the genetic disruption of alpha and beta chains of the endogenous TCR, observing &#62;90% efficiency for both genes, thus generating triple-knockout T-cells. By repetitively stimulating healthy donors&#8217; peripheral blood mononuclear cells with autologous antigen-presenting cells loaded with a pool of peptides selected to be immunogenic and expressed by CRC, we obtained a library of anti-tumor TCRs to redirected the specificity of triple knock-out lymphocytes. Our preliminary experiments showed a functional advantage for TCR-redirected, CD39 disrupted T-cells in recognizing and killing CRC target cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/89df335e-07d1-4384-bd58-bc9adb394809\/@y03B8ZFC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Immune checkpoint,Colorectal cancer,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16696"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alessia Potenza<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Balestrieri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Albarello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Pedica<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorena Stasi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Manfredi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Spiga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Tassi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatrice Claudia Cianciotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danilo Abbati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ugo Elmore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Biondi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Aldrighetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia De Lalla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giulia Di Lullo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo Dellabona<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eliana Ruggiero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riccardo Rosati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Bonini<\/i><\/presenter>.

Natural killer (NK) cells are an attractive platform for immunotherapy owing to their superior safety, multiple mechanisms of target killing, and reduced risk of alloreactivity. Recently, paradigm-shifting studies have shown that brief activation of NK cells with inflammatory cytokines induces differentiation into cytokine induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells. CIML NK cells have demonstrated potent anti-leukemia activity in preclinical settings and in recent clinical trials and therefore represent a novel platform for genetically modified chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cells for OVC therapy. Mesothelin (MSLN) is expressed in around 82% of OVCs and its expression is corelated with chemoresistance, increased metastasis, and poor overall survival in patients. We hypothesize arming CIML NK cells with a CAR targeting the proximal mesothelin domain will enhance their antitumor responses. We designed and tested anti-MSLN CAR CIML NK cells for their anti-cancer functionality against OVC cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). We first validated the mesothelin expression in 13 OVC patient samples which, based on pathological scoring showed high mesothelin in 8, moderate in 3, and low in 2 patient samples. PDOs also showed high expression of mesothelin, confirming it as an attractive candidate for CAR cells. We designed the aMSLN-CAR using an ScFv sequence against the proximal domain of the protein with 4-1BB and CD3&#950; as co-stimulatory domains. Primary NK cells were purified from peripheral blood, activated using IL-12, IL-18, and IL-15 to afford CIML NK cells. The CAR gene was transduced into CIML NK cells via our optimized baboon lentiviral system to achieve a high transduction efficiency of 40-60%. The direct cytotoxic effect of these NK cells was tested against OVC cell lines. OVC cell lines were co-cultured with NK cells at various effector:target (E:T) ratios for 6 hours and analyzed using apoptotic markers. Compared to CIML NK cells, aMSLN-CAR CIML NK cells showed enhanced cytotoxicity against OVCAR3 (47.9% vs 14.8%), SKOV3 (29.3% vs 8.0%) and OVCAR8 (60.7% vs 39.8%) at 10:1 ratio. To test the therapeutic potential of CAR CIML NK cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, three different PDOs were used. Cytotoxicity was determined by evaluating apoptotic EpCAM+ cancer cells amongst the organoid cell population after 18-hour co-culture with NK cells. The aMSLN-CAR CIML NK cells were shown to cause increased apoptosis in cells from PDOs compared to CIML NK cells; 58.2% vs 11.0%, 4.5% vs 61.0%, and 10.5% vs 32.0%. We are currently evaluating the <i>in vivo<\/i> functionality of aMSLN-CAR CIML NK cells in a xenograft mouse model using OVC cell lines and PDOs. The successful application of CAR CIML-NK cells will pave way for the use of NK cell platforms for other solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41e7582a-3597-4a77-b08e-6c39aef6c955\/@y03B8ZFC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Mesothelin,Adoptive cell therapy,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16697"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mubin Tarannum<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliana A.

Mesothelin represents a promising surface tumor antigen, since it has been associated with tumor invasion and is highly expressed on various cancer types, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. As clinical trials of mesothelin targeting CAR have yet to show efficacy, we hypothesized that tumor stromal cells such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may play a role in this resistance. To provide a more favorable TME for CAR T cells, we generated a bicistronic lentiviral vector encoding a mesothelin CAR along with a secreted T cell engaging molecule (TEAM) that targets fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is expressed by CAFs. We termed our constructs CAR<sup>TEAM<\/sup>, and in this case, meso<sup>FAP<\/sup>. We have assessed the activation and proliferative capacity of these CAR<sup>TEAM<\/sup> through <i>in vitro<\/i> assays. We showed that TEAMs secreted by CAR T cells bind their appropriate target antigen by adding supernatant from CAR<sup>TEAM<\/sup> to target cells expressing FAP. In a co-culture assay using a transwell system we demonstrated the cytotoxic effect of secreted TEAM interacting and recruiting bystander T cells against CAFs. In a real-time cell analysis (RTCA) co-culture assay with a pancreatic cancer cell line (AsPC1) and FAP expressing CAFs, we showed cell death of AsPC1 upon CAR recognition and cell death of CAFs through TEAM-mediated recruitment of bystander T cells and CART cells. We show in these co-culture systems, mimicking tumor and TME, that our CAR<sup>TEAM<\/sup> construct is superior in the elimination of both cancer cell line and CAF, in comparison to control constructs, including mesothelin targeting CAR T cells (meso CAR) and meso CAR T cells secreting an unspecific CD19 TEAM (meso<sup>CD19<\/sup>). We also used acoustic force microscopy to evaluate the additive effect of the TEAM molecule secreted to binding to tumor cells by mesothelin CAR T cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments of subcutaneously injected tumor cells admixed with CAFs, show superior tumor control when treated with CAR<sup>TEAM<\/sup> in comparison to control constructs. Based on these data, we demonstrate both the effective <i>in vitro<\/i> elimination of CAFs and pancreatic cancer cells through the application of CAR<sup>TEAM<\/sup> and control of pancreatic tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our studies provide a deeper insight into a dual targeting strategy using a novel CAR T cell secreting a TEAM against pancreatic cancer and its tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea4a844f-bfa1-4cff-bbd7-91acc4bcbbda\/@z03B8ZFD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Mesothelin,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16699"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marc Wehrli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Kuo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Larson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Scarfò<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Bouffard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Korneel Grauwet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Leick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Schmidts<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Bailey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tamina Kienka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Kann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonika Vatsa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harrison Silva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathleen Gallagher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Max Jan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Ting<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcela Maus<\/i><\/presenter>.

Universal or modular CARs do not directly recognize the tumor target antigen, but bind via an adaptor molecule to their respective tumor target. We describe the P329G-CAR-T platform as a novel modular CAR-T cell platform that recognizes the P329G mutation in the Fc portion of IgG1 antibodies, a mutation frequently applied to abolish the Fc immune effector function of therapeutic antibodies. In contrast to other adaptor CAR-T cell platforms this approach does not rely on haptens or artificial tags fused to the targeting antibody.The crystal structure analysis of the anti-P329G Fab fragment in complex with a P329G-Fc portion showed that the Fab fragment recognizes the Fc mutation with 1:1 binding stoichiometry. Surface plasmon resonance analysis determined the equilibrium binding affinity of the P329G antibody to the P329G Fc-portion to be 15 nM. Cell assays using Jurkat-NFAT reporter cell lines and primary T cells transduced with the P329G-CAR showed specific recruitment of P329G CAR-T cells by P329G-containing antibodies, and potent and dose dependent tumor cell killing accompanied by IFNg release and subsequent T cell activation for several unrelated tumor antigens including CD20, CD33, HER2, FOLR1 and mesothelin. Notably, P329G-CAR-T cell killing activity was comparable to the activity of the respective direct scFv-based CAR-T cells, both in terms of kinetics and absolute killing potency. Finally, comparable activity was determined in comparison to CD16 extracellular domain (ECD)-based CAR-T cells engaging the CAR-T cells via the Fc-CD16-ECD interaction. In summary, P329G-CAR-T cells mediate potent tumor cell killing in combination with various tumor targeting antibodies as adaptor molecules. The combination with tumor targeting antibodies enables control of CAR-T activity by adjusting the dose and schedule of the respective antibody adaptor molecule. Importantly, different from CD16-ECD-based CAR-T cells, P329G-CAR-T cells cannot be engaged by endogenous immunoglobulins. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies to investigate efficacy and safety of P329G CAR-T cells are currently being completed and will be reported.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad3cde3c-c5f6-422f-a2b3-8f6dc1142bb4\/@z03B8ZFD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Antibody engineering,Adoptive cell therapy,Monoclonal antibodies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16700"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Diana Darowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed-Reda Benmebarek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Jost<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kay Stubenrauch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uwe Wessels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joerg Benz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Freimoser-Grundschober<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ekkehard Moessner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pablo Umana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastian Kobold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Christian Klein<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

To enhance tumor recognition by T cells, chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) consisting of signaling domains fused to receptors that recognize tumor antigens can be expressed in T cells. While CAR T cells can successfully treat hematopoietic malignancies, CAR T cells have not shown success in treating solid tumors. There are many factors that may enhance CAR T cell efficacy and safety for solid tumor treatment, including addition of costimulatory domains to increase T cell functions and switching the T cell type used from alpha beta to gamma delta T cells. We developed a novel CAR (chimeric PD-1, chPD1) that targets the programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1) ligands expressed on many types of solid tumors. The aim of this study was to compare anti-tumor efficacy and safety of chPD1-expressing gamma delta and alpha beta T cells in murine breast and ovarian cancer models. Inclusion of different costimulatory domains, CD28, 4-1BB, and Dap-10, in the chPD1 receptor was also compared. There were no differences in T cell viability and proliferation when comparing costimulatory domains or T cell type. Additionally, there were no significant differences in killing of murine breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. ChPD1-CD28 T cells had increased secretion of proinflammatory and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)-inducing cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-6, GM-CSF, and nitric oxide, compared to chPD1-41BB and chPD1-Dap10 receptors. Additionally, alpha beta chPD1 T cells had increased cytokine secretion of inflammatory cytokines compared to chPD1 gamma delta T cells. Furthermore, while gamma delta and alpha beta T cells expressing chPD1 receptors with a Dap10 domain had similar anti-tumor efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>, chPD1-Dap10 gamma delta T cells had the lowest serum levels of inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-6, and GM-CSF. Therefore, inclusion of Dap10 domains in gamma delta T cells may be a safer and more efficacious option for CAR T cell therapy of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a43efbb7-9f9a-44ef-9ca4-d42eada4576c\/@z03B8ZFD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Chimeric antigen receptor,PD-1,Costimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16701"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amorette E.

Based on this preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data, TAC01-HER2, a first-in-class TAC T product targeting HER2 (ERBB2), has entered a phase I\/II clinical trial in patients with HER2-positive solid tumors. Here, we present the development of a new TAC T product targeting Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) to treat gastric cancer. CLDN18.2 belongs to a family of Claudin tight junction proteins whose expression is naturally exclusive to normal stomach. In gastric cancer cells, however, CLDN18.2 surface expression is upregulated and perturbed, leading to tumor-selective surface expression of CLDN18.2. Thus, CLDN18.2 is a preferred antigen for the specific targeting of tumor cells via TAC T cells.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods: <\/b>CLDN18.2-TAC receptor functionality was characterized using a variety of <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> assays. <i>In vitro<\/i> assays were based on flow cytometric analysis of TAC surface staining and cytokine release. Cytotoxicity was assessed via luminescence-based co-culture assays and real-time microscopy. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies examined the anti-tumor effect of TAC-engineered T-cells against established solid CLDN18.2 expressing tumor xenografts.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The CLDN18.2-TAC receptor showed strong surface expression and specific activation when co-cultured with a variety of cancer cells expressing CLDN18.2 <i>in vitro<\/i>. Secretion of IL2, IFNg and TNFa were comparable with cytokine levels produced by activated control TAC T cells. <i>In vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity assays demonstrated a strong anti-CLDN18.2 response and killing of CLDN18.2 expressing target cell lines. No increases in cytokine levels and no cytotoxicity were observed in non-transduced T cells and CLDN18.2-TAC T cells co-cultured with CLDN18.2-negative target cells, indicating that the T cell response is specific to the CLDN18.2 antigen. Intravenous administration of CLDN18.2-TAC T cells in mice carrying CLDN18.2-positive solid tumor xenografts led to a sustained anti-tumor response.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> data confirm strong and specific activity of CLDN18.2-targeted TAC T cells against CLDN18.2-expressing solid tumor models and highlight the versatility of the TAC platform for therapeutic applications in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a2c49a51-af6e-4161-bee1-e5177bac8507\/@z03B8ZFD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive immunotherapy,Claudin 18.2,Cancer immunotherapy,T cell antigen coupler (TAC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16702"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tania Benatar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ling Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thanyashanthi Nitya-Nootan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather MacGregor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanna Prosser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philbert Ip<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prabha Lal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Shaver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadhak Sengupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher W.

Poor in vitro cell expansion, inefficient T-cell migration and T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment greatly limits the broader application of this approach. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Casitas B-lineage lymphoma b (CBL-B) is highly expressed in T cells, where it limits cell activation following TCR engagement, therefore functioning as an important intracellular checkpoint that limits T cell mediated anti-tumor responses. We have developed NX-0255 a highly potent small molecule inhibitor of CBL-B that increases TCR-mediated activation of T cells in the presence or absence of CD28 co-stimulation. Here we used the OT-1 ACT\/E.G7-OVA lymphoma and the Pmel-1 ACT\/B16 melanoma tumor models to investigate whether adding NX-0255, during the <i>in vitro<\/i> expansion of tumor-specific T cells would have favorable effects on their ability to reject tumors following adoptive transfer <i>in vivo<\/i>. OT-1 CD8+ T cells were expanded <i>in vitro<\/i> using anti-CD3 stimulation and either NX-0255 alone, IL-2 alone, or NX-0255 combined with IL-2 and subsequently transferred <i>in vivo<\/i> to mice bearing established E.G7-OVA. ACT of OT-1 CD8+ T cells cultured with the combination of NX-0255 plus IL-2 demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity against E.G7-OVA lymphoma tumors, resulting in significant improvement in survival when compared to mice receiving OT-1 CD8+ T cells cultured with NX-0255 alone or IL-2 alone. Importantly, OT-1 CD8+ T cells cultured in the presence of NX-0255 or the combination of NX-0255 plus IL-2 were found at an increased frequency in the blood and in the tumor and persisted longer in circulation when compared to cells cultured with IL-2 alone. A lower percentage of the tumor-infiltrating OT-1 cells were triple-positive for exhaustion markers PD1+TIM3+LAG3+ expression when cultured with NX-0255 alone or the combination of NX-0255 and IL-2 compared to culture with IL-2 alone. Similarly, ACT of Pmel-1 CD8+ T cells cultured with the combination of NX-0255 plus IL-2 provides a robust and durable anti-tumor response compared to mice receiving Pmel-1 CD8+ T cells cultured with IL-2 alone in the aggressive B16-OVA model. Flow cytometry analysis showed that Pmel-1 CD8+ T cells cultured in the presence of NX-0255 plus IL-2 were found at an increased frequency in the blood and showed an increased central-memory phenotype (CD44+CD62L+) after adoptive transfer when compared to cells cultured with IL-2 alone. Collectively, these data suggest that adding the CBL-B inhibitor, NX-0255, during the <i>in vitro<\/i> expansion of tumor-specific T cells increases the frequency and absolute numbers of less exhausted CD8+ memory T-cells, increasing their in vivo persistence and ability to infiltrate the tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/69fb0b7b-0c66-4178-b40c-205b44fcca7e\/@z03B8ZFD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Small molecule drugs,Mouse models,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16703"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marilena Gallotta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Gomez Romo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Borodovsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Austin Tenn-McClellan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Stokes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifa Gosling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gwenn M.

Beside classical approaches via antibodies against HER2, the use of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) cells also in a solid cancer context is getting more and more attention. In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of Trastuzumab versus HER2 targeting CAR-T cells in a panel of human cancer cell lines (SK-OV3, Hs578T and JIMT-1) with different HER2 expression levels <i>in vitro<\/i> in 2D as well as 3D and <i>in vivo<\/i> in immunocompromised mice. <i>In vitro<\/i>, the tumor growth and invasion of the CAR-T cells was measured via fluorescence-based live cell imaging. On the last experiment day, a metabolic read-out (CellTiter-Glo, CTG assay) was performed. <i>In vivo<\/i>, we measured tumor growth inhibition (TGI) via caliper measurement and tumor tissue and hematopoietic organs were analyzed by flow cytometry (FC), Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and multiplex cytokine analysis. The HER2 targeting CAR-T cells eradicated the 3D spheroids of the HER2+ SK-OV3 as well as JIMT-1 in a dose-dependent manner. The untransduced control T cells did not influence the tumor growth<i> in vitro<\/i>. Trastuzumab displayed efficacy in 2D and 3D in SKOV3. As expected, JIMT-1 cells were resistant to trastuzumab treatment despite their positive HER2 status. The HER2- cell line Hs578T served as a negative control and proved to be resistant to any treatment in this study. The HER2-targeting CAR-T cells were applied <i>in vivo<\/i> in two different doses to JIMT-1 tumor bearing NSG mice (n=8\/group) and tumor volume was measured over time. Again, the CAR-T cells were able to induce a complete remission. In contrast, the tumors displayed progressive disease under therapy with the untransduced T cells or Trastuzumab. Interestingly, the CAR-T cells induced a tumor swelling between eight- and twelve-days post injection very similar to the situation in the patient. Four weeks post injection the human T cells could be detected in spleen, peripheral blood, liver and bone marrow of the JIMT- bearing mice. The implication of this finding for possible side effects of the HER2 CAR&#180;s remains to be elucidated. A PK\/PD study is currently ongoing for this purpose.

Tumors were collected from 43 patients undergoing surgery to remove primary kidney tumors. Tumor types included clear cell RCC (86.0%), papillary RCC (11.6%) as well as chromophobe RCC (2.3%). Tumors were minced into fragments, placed in individual wells of a 24-well plate containing media with high dose IL-2 (6000 IU\/mL), and cultured for four weeks. Successful expansion was considered when at least one fragment expanded to a minimum of 2 wells. Successfully expanded TIL were then evaluated for T-cell phenotypes as well as reactivity to the autologous tumor. Of all RCC tumors collected, TIL were successfully grown for 79% of the samples (34\/43). The T-cell phenotype of these TIL was highly variable across samples, although there was a higher percentage of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells relative to CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells. The reactivity of expanded TIL was then assessed by IFN&#947; release. We found that TIL secreted IFN&#947; in response to autologous tumor in 71% of the samples. Together, these results demonstrated the feasibility of expanding functional tumor reactive TIL from RCC. Given that hypoxia plays an important role in the development of RCC tumors and is associated with poor prognosis, we then evaluated the ability to expand TIL under hypoxic conditions. To this end, primary TIL were cultured at various O<sub>2<\/sub> levels (20% O<sub>2<\/sub>, 5% O<sub>2<\/sub> or 1% O<sub>2<\/sub>) and the cell yield as well as the T-cell memory phenotypes were evaluated. We found that the yield of TIL grown in hypoxic conditions was lower when compared to normoxic conditions (20% O<sub>2<\/sub>), suggesting a reduction of TIL proliferation in hypoxia. TIL grown in hypoxic conditions displayed increased percentage of central memory T-cells compared to TIL cultured at 20% O<sub>2<\/sub>, as evaluated by CD45RA and CCR7 expression (CD45RA<sup>-<\/sup>CCR7<sup>+<\/sup>). Primary TIL were then expanded to larger numbers using a rapid expansion protocol (REP) by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody in the presence of allogenic feeder cells. REP of TIL was carried out at either atmospheric O<sub>2<\/sub> (20% O<sub>2<\/sub>) or at a hypoxic O<sub>2<\/sub> level (5% O<sub>2<\/sub>), and the T-cell phenotype as well as reactivity to the autologous tumor were assessed. Unlike pre-REP TIL, TIL that underwent REP were able to expand in hypoxic conditions (5% O<sub>2<\/sub>) and displayed increased percentage of tissue resident memory T-cells (CD69+CD103+; 19%) when compared to the starting TIL population (0.11 %) or TIL expanded at atmospheric O<sub>2<\/sub> (0.17%). When co-cultured with the autologous tumor, hypoxic TILs displayed increased IFN&#947;, TNF&#945; as well as increased Granzyme B release (p&#60;0.001) when compared to TIL expanded in normoxia (20% O<sub>2<\/sub>). Collectively, these results support the advantage of adapting TIL to hypoxic conditions in the production of tumor-reactive TIL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c7b3787c-9a8d-4642-bf1f-46a60d5a90be\/@z03B8ZFD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Hypoxia,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16707"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohammed Alkhouli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Martinez-Brockhus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew S.

Checkpoint molecule PD-L1 is widely overexpressed on multiple tumor types, and PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction is a primary mediator of immunosuppression in the TME. Here, we generated anti-PD-L1-specific shark single domain V<sub>NAR<\/sub>-based CAR T cell strategy and explored its anti-tumor efficacy in xenograft mouse models.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We isolated anti-PD-L1 single domain antibodies from semi-synthetic shark V<sub>NAR<\/sub> phage display libraries. The binding of isolated V<sub>NAR<\/sub>s was validated by ELISA, flow cytometry, and Octet. A peptide library based on human PD-L1 was synthesized to predict the epitope of select V<sub>NAR<\/sub>s. Anti-tumor efficacy of CAR T cells was determined via cell luciferase-based cell assay as well as xenograft mouse models. Two tumor models, MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast cancer) and Hep3B (hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC) were used in the present study. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a tumor-specific target in the Hep3B model.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified three anti-PD-L1 phage binders, B2, A11, and F5 from our shark phage libraries. All three binders showed cross-activity to human, mouse, and canine antigens, whereas only B2 functionally blocked the interaction of human PD-1 to PD-L1. Moreover, CAR (B2) T cells specifically lysed both MDA-MB-231 and Hep3B tumor cells by targeting constitutive and inducible expression of PD-L1. Importantly, the combination of anti-GPC3 CAR (hYP7) T cells with CAR (B2) T cells regress Hep3B tumors synergistically in mice.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> PD-L1-targeted shark V<sub>NAR<\/sub> single domain-based CAR T cell therapy is a novel strategy to treat breast cancer and liver cancer. This work provides a rationale for a potential use of anti-PD-L1 CAR T cells as a monotherapy or combination with a tumor-specific therapy in clinical studies for solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6ffce1be-88bc-4d78-ac25-140beb52b4c6\/@A03B8ZFE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single chain antibodies,PD-L1,CAR T cells,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16710"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dan Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hejiao English<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tianyuzhou Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Glenn Merlino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chi-Ping Day<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Ho<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, challenges related to safety exist: major concerns remain surrounding the cross-reactivity of T cell receptors (TCRs) as well as the ability of therapeutics to discriminate between on-target vs off-target pHLAs while maintaining high potency. Therefore, approaches that survey the diversity of the T cell repertoire to discover optimal TCRs, as well as platforms to comprehensively identify potential off-target liabilities, are critical to de-risking and accelerating the development of this promising class of pHLA-targeting therapeutics. We have developed a strategy that (1) queries the TCR repertoire to enrich and identify multiple active, sequence-distinct endogenous TCRs; (2) uses 3T-TRACE, a high-diversity pHLA library, to screen for cross-reactivity; and (3) exploits functional selections to simultaneously optimize for TCR potency and specificity. We applied this approach to identify TCRs of optimal specificity and potency targeting a peptide derived from the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 (SLLMWITQC) displayed by HLA-A2. We profiled 6 sequence-distinct TCRs using 3T-TRACE and validated potential endogenous off-target cross-reactivities. Many of the identified off-targets exhibited little to no sequence homology to the NY-ESO-1 epitope, highlighting the importance of diverse combinatorial libraries in identifying unexpected cross-reactivities. Leveraging the off-target liabilities identified by 3T-TRACE, we designed a functional library and selection scheme that enabled the identification of TCRs with increased potency and specificity. Optimized TCRs exhibited enhanced killing activity and improved safety against an NY-ESO-1-expressing melanoma cell line compared to benchmark TCRs, indicating that this approach has potential to improve clinical safety and efficacy. Using this multi-faceted and comprehensive approach we rapidly identified highly potent and specific TCRs against NY-ESO-1. Identifying cross-reactivities using 3T-TRACE proved to be critical in selecting TCRs suitable for engineering and functional selections. This approach can be extended to any pHLA target to create safe and effective TCR-Ts for clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/621c729d-968d-4f63-88c0-e01f7a4bff88\/@A03B8ZFE\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Solid tumors,Cancer therapy,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16713"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>John D.

The lack of novel therapies and limited immune checkpoint blockade efficacy suggests that CAR-T therapy would be a promising therapeutic approach for RMS and other sarcomas. The key to CAR specificity is to guide engineered T cells to a molecular target that is tumor specific, expressed on the cell surface, and expressed at high enough levels for CAR-T activation. Previous work identified Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 (FGFR4, CD334) as being specifically and consistently upregulated in RMS, making it a candidate target for CAR-T cells. We tested the feasibility of an FGFR4 targeted CAR for treating RMS using an NSG mouse with RH30 orthotopic (intramuscular) tumors. A previous CAR designed to target FGFR4 was active in vitro but failed to control orthotopic tumors in the NSG mouse model. A new generation of FGFR4 binders was produced targeting the membrane proximal domain of FGFR4. When engineered as CARs, these binders exceeded the activity of previous generation binders in vitro with regard to cellular cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Nevertheless, new candidate binders failed to control orthotopic tumors in vivo. We then interrogated the specific tumor defenses employed by RMS to evade immune control. First, we optimized CAR signaling domains to target low density antigen. Quantitative flow analysis determined FGFR4 expression to be a very low 700 molecules per cell on in vivo RH30 tumors, as opposed to 2-3,000 in tissue culture. We also found that RMS tumors produced a collagen-rich stroma, replete with immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Stroma was induced by T cell therapy and absent in untreated mice. This stroma sequesters CAR-T cells, and produces an immune-excluded phenotype, as assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemistry identified that M2 macrophages, and to a lesser degree MDSC, were the major cellular constituents of the therapy-induced stroma. RNA expression panel analysis (Nanostring) identified the induction of tumor defense-associated transcripts, including MIF, IDO1, and TGF&#946;, upon T cell therapy. Based on these results, we devised a strategy to augment CAR-T activity while removing the immunosuppressive barriers. The exposure of mice to anti-myeloid poly-pharmacy (targeting CSF1R (PLX3397), IDO1 (epacadostat), iNOS (L-NAME), TGF&#946; (SD208), PDL1 (&#945;PD1 antibody), MIF (gene knockout), and myeloid misdifferentiation (ATRA)) allowed FGFR4 CAR-T to successfully clear orthotopic RMS tumors. Our results demonstrate that RMS tumors, even with low copy number targets, can be targeted by CAR-T upon reversal of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, modeling an approach to treating pediatric sarcomas with CAR-T therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bbf3ee28-6fda-44f8-9d49-e0da898fb4c2\/@A03B8ZFE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Tumor associated macrophages,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4  (FGFR-4),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16714"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peter M.

The detection of tumors based on mammalian immunoglobulin scFvs has been a significant innovation in immunotherapy but is impacted by limits of immune tolerance and immune system evolution. The discovery of unique variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) - analogues to antibodies in evolutionarily distant jawless vertebrates - in the Cooper lab (Pancer, Nature) provides an opportunity to target antigens beyond those recognized by conventional antibodies. A particular VLR, termed MM3, was found to identify a distinct epitope specific to human plasma cells (PCs) and plasmablasts (PBs), created by CD38 dimerization with activity as an NAD+ glycohydrolase (Yu, JCI Insight). CD38 is an extensively explored target for treating multiple myeloma (MM); however, specific scFv-based targeting of CD38 on malignant plasma cells is difficult, as the protein is expressed on a variety of other immune cell lineages. Therefore, MM3 provides a unique, novel mechanism to target CD38 in a tumor-specific manner in MM and other plasma cell dyscrasias. Here, we present a CAR T cell with an MM3 binding domain replacing the standard scFv. Our CAR construct consists of the MM3 binding domain, a CD8 hinge and transmembrane domain, and 4-1BB and CD3zeta intracellular domains. Staining of MM patient bone marrow specimens revealed that the strong specificity for PCs and PBs previously observed in healthy donors was maintained in MM bone marrow, illustrating the ability of MM3 to target the malignant PC population. To assess <i>in vitro<\/i> function of the MM3 CAR T cells, flow cytometry analysis of co-cultures using healthy donor-derived MM3 CAR T cells and target cell lines revealed specific increased degranulation (CD107a expression), activation (CD69 expression), and killing (target cell Annexin V binding) over untransduced control T cells only in cell lines sensitive to MM3 binding, with no differences in negative control cell lines, demonstrating specific recognition and killing of target cells. Preliminary <i>in vivo <\/i>studies in the MISTRG6 myeloma xenograft mouse model were performed using intrafemorally injected INA-6, an IL-6-dependent MM cell line, which MM3 binds after growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. After treatment with MM3 CAR T cells via intravenous injection, we observed that the MM3 CAR T cells specifically homed to and were retained in the injected femur along with the tumor cells, suggesting tumor recognition and potential for <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy. In summary, these data demonstrate that VLR-based targeting may allow design of novel CAR constructs. Specifically, the VLR MM3 is a promising novel, non-scFv mechanism for targeting CD38 in a malignant PC-specific manner, and the MM3 CAR T cells have shown promising preliminary activity. Therefore, the VLR-based MM3 CAR T cell platform may provide a novel strategy to improve T cell redirection to target tumors in MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79ea716d-edc7-49db-9772-3e4c566f6e42\/@A03B8ZFE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Multiple myeloma,Adoptive cell therapy,CD38,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16715"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samuel S.

However, only 30-40% of patients treated with commercially available CART cell therapies obtain long term remission, highlighting the need for more efficacious and durable therapies. Emerging clinical data suggest several failure modes for CD19 CAR T cell therapies: including loss or downregulation of CD19 antigen, loss of co-stimulation pathways on tumor cells, exhaustion of CAR-T cells, and immunosuppressive microenvironments. To overcome these hurdles, we devised the next-generation autologous CAR-T cell therapy bbT369. bbT369 is dual targeted (CD79a\/CD20) CAR T cell therapy that uses an OR gate design to limit antigen escape, has split 41BB and CD28 co-stimulatory domain architecture to augment T cell activation, and contains a knock-out of the <i>CBLB<\/i> gene to enhance potency and reduce T cell exhaustion. Here we report the first results with bbT369, demonstrating anti-lymphoma activity in <i>in vitro<\/i> assays and <i>in vivo<\/i> using xenograft mouse models.<br \/>We demonstrate that CD79a and CD20 expression is B cell lineage restricted in normal human tissue and confirm that these proteins are co-expressed in diffuse large B cell samples. To target these antigens, we show a split dual-targeting CAR configuration is optimal for bbT369-directed tumor cell killing. Using an engineered megaTAL, we demonstrate high on-target activity of greater than 75% insertions and deletions (Indels) at the CBLB target site using clinical-scale manufacturing processes and low off-target activity (all off-targets less than 0.2%). In<i> in vitro <\/i>tumor co-culture assays, we show that inclusion of the CBLB gene edit in bbT369 increases Interleukin (IL)-2 production relative to an unedited anti-CD79a\/CD20 CAR T cell control. Using various xenograft mouse models, we showed that bbT369 has similar or improved efficacy compared to anti-CD19 CAR drug product, including in low tumor-antigen models. In the Toledo subcutaneous xenograft model, bbT369 showed a 3-fold increase in T cell expansion compared with an unedited anti-CD79a\/CD20 dual-targeting CAR T cell control. Furthermore, while a fraction of mice (3\/5) receiving the unedited anti-CD79a\/CD20 dual-targeting CAR T cells experienced late relapses (between 60-80 days following initial tumor clearance), all mice (n=5) receiving bbT369 were fully protected from late relapses (up to day 104 of follow-up). Collectively, the data support a first-in-human trial for bbT369 to evaluate initial safety and efficacy in NHL patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55fe1def-e623-4808-a872-f98db740ce8a\/@A03B8ZFE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16717"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"aefad2cc-a741-4a5f-9480-b453adefad91","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aefad2cc-a741-4a5f-9480-b453adefad91\/@A03B8ZFE\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Certo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Baldeviano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharlene Adams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Asimis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Astrakhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andy Chavkin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria L.

Our previously developed human chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-M) platform has shown potent anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical solid tumor models<sup>1<\/sup>, and the anti-HER2 CAR-M CT-0508 is currently being evaluated in a Phase I trial. The use of myeloid cells as a platform for cell therapy provides the tools to overcome critical solid tumor challenges such as infiltration, immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment, lymphocyte exclusion, and target antigen heterogeneity. Currently, CAR-M are generated in a week-long <i>ex-vivo <\/i>process in which peripheral blood monocytes are differentiated into macrophages prior to genetic manipulation. Here, we demonstrate the production feasibility, phenotype, pharmacokinetics, cellular fate, specificity, and anti-tumor activity of human CD14+ CAR monocytes.<br \/>Experimental: Using the chimeric adenoviral vector Ad5f35, we engineered primary human CD14+ monocytes to express a CAR (CAR-mono) targeted against HER2. We established a process that allowed for same day manufacturing (from Leukopak to cryopreserved CAR-mono cell product).<br \/>Results: CAR-mono showed high CAR expression and viability (&#62;90%), and efficiently differentiated into CAR-expressing macrophages. Adenoviral transduction led to pre-conditioning of CAR-mono, resulting in a strong M1 phenotype upon differentiation into CAR-M. CAR-mono derived macrophages demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity regardless of exposure to GM-CSF or M-CSF, and were protected against M2 switching by immunosuppressive factors. Treating CAR-mono with GM-CSF and IL-4 resulted in their differentiation to monocyte-derived CAR-DCs with an activated phenotype, indicating that these cells retained their myeloid differentiation potential. <i>In vivo<\/i>, CAR-mono induced anti-tumor activity in various HER2+ solid tumor xenograft models. Following IV administration, CAR-mono demonstrated the ability to traffic to both GM-CSF<sup>high<\/sup> and GM-CSF<sup>low <\/sup>expressing tumors. Notably, CAR-mono showed long-term CAR expression and persistence (&#62;180 days) in both NSG and NSG-S mouse models, demonstrating lasting persistence irrespective of human cytokine support.<br \/>Conclusions: The CAR-mono platform enables an automated, same-day manufacturing process while maintaining the key characteristics of CAR-M therapy. The use of Ad5f35 for human monocyte transduction primes the cells toward M1 macrophage differentiation and produces a cell population phenotypically and functionally similar to our established CAR-M platform. These data provide strong pre-clinical support to advance the CAR-mono platform into clinical testing.<sup>1<\/sup>Klichinsky M, et al.

While initially effective in up to 90% of patients with B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, over 40% of patients will relapse, with sub-optimal persistence of functional CAR-T cells underlying many of these relapses. The major challenges of CAR-T cell to effectively eliminate cancer cells are extending persistence of CAR-T cells and retaining the effector function of CAR-T cells <i>in vivo<\/i> after prolonged <i>in vitro<\/i> expansion. To overcome such limitations, enhancing mitochondrial metabolism is emerging as an appealing approach to regulate CAR-T cell function, however, increasing mitochondrial respiration and ATP production is a challenging strategy. We have previously identified MCJ\/DnaJC15 as an endogenous negative regulator of Complex I of electron transport chain. The absence of MCJ in CD8 cells (MCJ KO CD8 cells) increases Complex I activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial respiration without affecting glycolysis. Lack of MCJ enhances cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity (two processes dependent on mitochondrial ATP) in CD8 cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Using the B16 melanoma cell model, we have shown that antigen-specific MCJ KO CD8 cells are superior in killing melanoma cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We have generated WT and MCJ KO CD19-41BB CAR-T cells and tested their anti-tumor activity against B-cell leukemia. The results reveal that MCJ-deficient CAR-T cells exhibit superior killing capacity against leukemia B cells and prolong survival of the leukemia-bearing mice. Together, these data demonstrate MCJ as an attractive target to enhance CAR-T cell therapy efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/35982d4e-ad91-41f3-9c33-fa2f001ee67f\/@B03B8ZFF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Mitochondria,CAR T cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16719"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meng-Han Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Giddlings<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Danis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan McCalab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Eric Kohler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mercedes Rincon<\/i><\/presenter>.

The major obstacle solid tumors present for cell therapy is the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which can impair the function of endogenous as well as therapeutic immune cells. To overcome this challenge, Senti Bio is developing gene circuits to arm CAR-NK cells with multiple cytokines to improve the cytotoxicity and persistence of CAR-NK product candidates. Cytokines, as well as other immune effectors, can act in autocrine or paracrine manner, benefiting the CAR-NK cells as well as potentially engaging the local immune system in the TME. Secreted cytokines can be widely distributed and stimulate other immune cells in the TME, however this is often associated with systemic toxicity as well as reduced impact on the CAR-NK cells. On the other hand, membrane-bound cytokines result in a localized and potent stimulation of the CAR-NK cells but have limited impact on the broader TME. Since IL-15 is known to stimulate NK cell survival and function, Senti Bio has created a novel calibrated release (cr) technology to specifically optimize IL-15 signaling in its CAR-NK platform. crIL-15 is tethered to the NK cells via a cleavable linker that allows for IL-15 release upon cleavage by a ubiquitously expressed protease on the cell surface of NK cells. The rate of linker cleavage can be calibrated by engineering the sensitivity of the cleavable linker sequence to the cell surface protease, thereby enabling the tuning of the ratio of membrane tethered versus fully secreted protein. We compared the function of the wildtype IL-15 protein with different variants of crIL-15 that have a faster or slower release. We demonstrated that crIL-15 has a more potent function, stimulating pSTAT5 signaling and driving expansion and survival of NK cells. CAR-NK cells armed with crIL-15 significantly outperformed CAR-NK cells that expressed the wildtype IL-15 protein, had enhanced function, and demonstrated significantly improved cytotoxicity over three rounds of serial killing (p&#60;0.0001). In parallel, we armed CAR-NK cells with gene circuits that encoded various combinations of two or more cytokines. In particular, the combination of IL-15 and IL-21 resulted in a synergistic effect, leading to longer survival in the absence of cytokines compared to NK cells armed with IL-15 alone. Furthermore, CAR-NK cells armed with IL-15 + IL-21 had significantly increased activity and cytotoxicity compared to CAR-NK cells armed with either cytokine alone (up to 4-times increased cytotoxicity, p&#60;0.0001) when co-cultured with tumor cells. Overall, our results suggest the advantage of multi-arming CAR-NK cells with cytokines, using controlled release systems and cytokine combinations, resulting in improved NK cell function in solid tumor models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/15dbc113-7760-44cb-9dc8-6c756181ffe5\/@B03B8ZFF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Colorectal Cancer,Immuno-oncology,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16720"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alba Gonzalez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Hung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcela Guzman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aldo Sotelo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Frankel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yin Yin Chong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepika Kaveri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Poornima Ramkumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Leitner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priscilla Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronni Ponek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alyssa L.

To address these challenges we have engineered AB-1015, an integrated circuit T cell (ICT cell) intended for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The AB-1015 transgene cassette encodes an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic gate designed to limit off-tumor toxicity through dual tumor antigen recognition and a dual shRNA-miR to resist TME suppression and improve ICT cell function and persistence. The AB-1015 DNA cassette is inserted into the T cell genome at a defined novel genomic site via CRISPR-based gene editing. The AB-1015 logic gate consists of a priming receptor that induces expression of an anti-mesothelin (MSLN) CAR upon engagement of a ALPG\/P (alkaline phosphatase germ-line\/placental). The dual-antigen specificity of the logic gate was assessed in mice engrafted with MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> and ALPG\/P<sup>+<\/sup>MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> K562 tumors established on contralateral flanks. AB-1015 ICT cells eliminated ALPG\/P<sup>+<\/sup>MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> tumors, while sparing tumors that lacked ALPG\/P. To assess the ability of AB-1015 to mediate killing of MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells in the context of heterogeneous cultures, we utilized an admixed co-culture system where ALPG\/P<sup>+<\/sup> target cells were spiked into cultures that were otherwise MSLN<sup>+<\/sup>. AB-1015 was able to eliminate admixed co-cultures where as few as 5-15% of the target cells expressed ALPG\/P.The AB-1015 also contains a dual shRNA-miR that targets FAS and PTPN2, two critical mediators of T cells survival and function. FASL, the cognate ligand for FAS receptor, is expressed on the surface of activated T cells and is significantly overexpressed in the ovarian cancer TME. In vitro, AB-1015 demonstrated resistance to FAS-mediated apoptosis. Knockdown of PTPN2, a phosphatase involved in T cell proliferation and functional persistence, resulted in enhanced AB-1015 ICT cell expansion during repetitive stimulation over a period of 14 days, as well as a 30-fold reduction in tumor outgrowth compared with logic gated T cells alone. In summary, AB-1015 ICT cells are specific for ALPG\/P<sup>+<\/sup>MSLN<sup>+<\/sup>, demonstrate superior potency, expansion, and persistence compared with logic gated T cells alone, and are resistant to ovarian TME suppression. These results support further evaluation of AB-1015 as a novel therapy for indications including ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4b4be833-7300-4b30-9cd4-6379fbbed0ee\/@B03B8ZFF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutics,T cell,Mesothelin,Fas,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16721"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen Santoro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Cooper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Bezman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kanika Chawla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer McDevitt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tarjei Mikkelsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susie Jun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>W.

However, challenges including poor T cell effector function, lack of proliferation, and limited persistence have prevented ACTs from reaching their full curative potential. In addition, ACTs typically require lymphodepletion to aid cell engraftment. Lymphodepletion has been shown to improve persistence and efficacy of ACTs by elevating T-cell common gamma-chain cytokines like IL-7 and IL-15. However, lymphodepletion regimens have been identified as a risk factor for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and infectious complications from opportunistic pathogens. IL-2, another common gamma-chain cytokine, is a potent stimulator of T cells, making it an attractive cytokine to support ACT and potentially bypass the need for lymphodepletion. However, therapeutic use of IL-2 is limited by systemic toxicity due its promiscuous activation of immune cells.<br \/>To facilitate selective delivery of an IL-2 signal to engineered T cells and avoid signaling in bystander T cells and NK cells, we developed a mouse orthogonal receptor\/ligand system consisting of a mutated IL-2 Receptor Beta (moR&#946;) and a pegylated, IL-2 mutein (moIL-2) that does not significantly activate the wild type IL-2&#946; receptor but does activate moR&#946;. T cells from pmel-1 T cell receptor-transgenic mice, recognizing gp100 on B16 melanoma cells were transduced with moR&#946; (orthoPmel). A highly active moIL-2 was continuously dosed for four weeks in mice. Thy1.1<sup>+<\/sup> orthoPmel T cells were tracked by FACS and IHC systemically and in the tumor.<br \/>During orthoPmel manufacturing, moIL-2 specifically enriched orthoPmel compared to mouse WT IL-2. OrthoPmel in combination with moIL-2 controlled tumor growth in lymphoreplete mice bearing established B16 tumors while neither component alone inhibited tumor growth. moIL-2 significantly expanded orthoPmel systemically and intratumorally, with orthoPmel ultimately accounting for greater than 80% or 40% of all peripheral and intratumoral T cells, respectively. Systemic orthoPmel maintained a consistent central memory and effector memory mix throughout the four-week moIL-2 treatment course. moIL-2 also induced the expression of activation markers, CD25 and Granzyme B, in intratumoral orthoPmel.<br \/>These findings validate than an orthogonal IL-2\/IL-2R&#946; platform can enhance efficacy of ACTs without peripheral expansion or activation of NK cells or non-tumor specific T cells and the toxicities typically associated with high dose IL-2 therapy. Importantly, these results demonstrate the potential of this platform overcome the requirement of lymphodepletion in adoptive cell therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/57f8b591-c0cd-405f-944e-c43d3b16685d\/@B03B8ZFF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,T cell,Immuno-oncology,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16722"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christina Kochel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meng Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Navneet Ratti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandro Vivona<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahalaksmi Ramadass<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Semana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Bauer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammed Ali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Emmerich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rob Kastelein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick J.

However, those successes are often associated with serious dose-limiting adverse events including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector-cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), as well as frequent tumor relapse. Specifically, in AML, there is a need for controllable and adaptable cellular therapeutics that can address intra- and inter- patient disease heterogeneity and off-target antigen expression that contribute to these dose-limiting adverse events. Herein, we report a novel T cell therapy, ACLX-002, comprised of a soluble tumor targeting protein (SPRX002) that specifically binds CD123-expressing AML cells and targets those cells for destruction by <i>ex <\/i>vivo transduced T cells known as Antigen Receptor Complex (ARC) T cells. Functional <i>in vitro<\/i> studies of ARC-T cells produced from healthy subjects demonstrated SPRX002 dose-dependent cytokine production, T cell proliferation, and cytotoxic activity of co-cultured CD123-expressing cancer cell lines. The cytolytic machinery of the ARC-T cells is only activated when the tri-complex of the ARC-T cell, SPRX002, and CD123-expressing cell is fully formed. ACLX-002 also demonstrated dose- and schedule-dependent <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in both the MOLM14 and MV4-11 disseminated CD123-expressing tumor models in NSG immunocompromised mice, as well as multiple AML patient derived xenograft models. A single dose of 5 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> ARC-T cells together with SPRX002 doses of 0.3 mg\/kg daily were able to eliminate measurable tumor burden that was similar to a CD123-directed traditional CAR-T that uses the same CD123-binding domain as SPRX002. Furthermore, the <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy was not limited by the expression of CD123 on donor T cells, an attribute that is induced by <i>in vitro<\/i> activation and expansion of ARC-T cells. The data support the paradigm that ARC-T cells can be activated and silenced by controlling the dose and schedule of administered SPRX002, which may improve the safety and effectiveness of T cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a461f392-8174-455f-981b-334cfc512f94\/@B03B8ZFF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,CD123,CAR T cells,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16723"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justin P.

Tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG72) is an aberrantly glycosylated protein overexpressed on ovarian cancer and is an exciting target for CAR T cell immunotherapy. Our lab previously developed a second-generation TAG72 CAR T cell product and showed its potency against TAG72-expressing ovarian tumor cells both in vitro and in preclinical mouse models. We report here further modification of our TAG72 CAR T cells, with incorporation of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-15 (IL-15), and evaluate the therapeutic benefits in peritoneal ovarian tumor models.<br \/>In this preclinical study, we build upon our earlier work with in vitro and in vivo evaluation of 9 different second-generation TAG72 CAR constructs varying in single-chain variable fragment, extracellular spacer, transmembrane, and intracellular co-stimulatory domains. We then engineer CAR T cells with two types of cytokines - IL-12 and IL-15 - and put these engineered cells against challenging in vivo tumor models.<br \/>Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we identified the most optimal construct with which we aim to evaluate in a phase 1 clinical trial targeting TAG72-positive ovarian cancer in early 2022. Despite thorough optimizations to the CAR backbone, CAR T cells can be additionally engineered for improved anti-tumor response. Therefore, we further engineered CAR T cells with IL-12 or IL-15 production that greatly improved the effectiveness of TAG72-CAR T cells in difficult-to-treat in vivo tumor models. We observed that modification of CAR T cells with IL-15 displayed toxicity when regionally delivered <i>in vivo<\/i>, yet introduction of IL-12 not only demonstrated safe and superior therapeutic responses, but also allowed the regional administration of CAR T cells to address systemic disease. We are now expanding these findings by evaluating these therapies using syngeneic immunocompetent mouse tumor models.<br \/>The tumor microenvironment (TME) harbors various factors that thwart the killing of tumor cells by CAR T cells. Thus, CAR T cells will likely require further engineering to overcome this barrier. We show that amplifying cytokine pathways is one way to overcome the TME and improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3d22d0d3-f75d-46ab-bd77-f73f8c2b7db3\/@B03B8ZFF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Cytokines,Interleukin-12,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16724"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hee Jun Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saul Priceman<\/i><\/presenter>.
