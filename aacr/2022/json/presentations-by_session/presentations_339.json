[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b><b> <\/b>An association between red and processed meat and esophageal cancer (EC) and gastric cancer (GC) has been suggested. Northern Iran is one of the most burdened countries by these malignancies. This study aims to investigate the effect exerted by different meat types on both EC and GC, including their subtypes, in a high risk population.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><b> <\/b>Golestan cohort study (GCS) is a population-based cohort of 50,045 individuals aged 40-75 years from northeast Iran. The participants were selected by random sampling of people without a history of upper-GI cancer. Detailed data on different exposures were collected upon enrolment using validated questionnaires, in particular a 116-item food frequency questionnaire was specifically designed and validated for this population and was used to assess dietary habits among the cohort. Total meat items included unprocessed red meat (lamb, beef, and hamburger), organ meat (liver, kidney and heart), processed meat (sausage and deli meat), white meat (chicken and fish). For the analysis, a term for total red meat intake was created including the first three types of meat. We considered quintiles of meat consumption, using grams and density (g\/total kcal). The outcomes were EC, carcinoma of the lower third of the esophagus, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), GC, cardia GC and non-cardia GC. We used proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs for the association between meat types and cancers.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> The cohort reported a mean intake of 18.4 g\/day (95% CI=17.8-18.6) for total red meat, and 72.1 g\/day (95% CI=70.3-73.8) for white meat. These values correspond to an intake density of 8.11 g per 1000 kcal (95% CI=8.05-8.19) and 32.3 g (95% CI= 32.0-32.5) per 1000 kcal for total red and white meat respectively. Of 49,585 participants included in the analyses after 12 year mean follow-up, 369 developed EC, including 141 cases of the lower esophagus, 309 ESCC cases and 20 EAC, and 368 developed GC, of whom 216 cardia and 97 non-cardia. No association was found for EC except for red meat among women (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.27 for one-quintile increase in intake). The risk of GC was increased for total red meat (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.17) and red meat intake separately (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.18). These trends were stronger among men, non-cardia GC, and red meat (HR 1.23, 95% CI=1.02-1.48). Cooking type did not influence the risk of developing any cancer, while we observed strong associations between red meat unprocessed and overall and GC among opium users, suggesting an effect modification.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Red meat intake is associated to GC, but not EC. Other types of meat show no relation. Lifestyle habits such as opium use can increase this risk of GC in high meat consumers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9eb595bd-5d0d-43d6-9b3c-2c16f7e11632\/@B03B8ZD3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13444"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Giulia Collatuzzo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arash Etemadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Farin Kamangar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abnet Christian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandy Dawsey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Brennan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masoud Sotoudeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hossein Poutschi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masoud Khoshnia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akram Pourshams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reza Malekzadeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo Boffetta<\/i><\/presenter>.

Studies suggest that weight gain after age 18 plays a role in the development of breast cancer; however, the research related to their association is inconsistent. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations between weight gain after age 18 and risk of breast cancer and to clarify whether there is heterogeneity stratified by menopausal status.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed a comprehensive literature search of all relevant studies published prior to February 19, 2021, according to the established inclusion criteria, utilizing Medline (Ovid), Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Two reviewers independently reviewed the articles for final inclusion. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of studies. Summary risk estimates (REs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effect or fixed-effect model, based on heterogeneity significance. Subgroup analyses were performed based on types of study design (case-control vs. cohort), country of study (the USA vs. other countries), and menopausal status (premenopausal vs. postmenopausal). We conducted sensitivity analysis and publication bias detection. We performed all statistical analyses with STATA version 16.1, and all P values were two-tailed, the test level was 0.05.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Seventeen out of 4,368 unique studies (12 case-control studies and 5 cohort studies) met the selection criteria. All studies were considered moderate to high quality with NOS scores that ranged from 5 to 8. Overall, weight gain after age 18 was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (RE = 1.27; 95%CI = 1.13 - 1.42). In subgroup analyses, menopausal status was a source of heterogeneity. Weight gain after age 18 was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women (RE = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.31 - 1.62), but not among premenopausal women (RE = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.95 - 1.11). We did not find differences in associations by type of study design (case-control study: RE = 1.28; 95%CI = 1.09 - 1.51; cohort study: RE = 1.24; 95%CI = 1.07 - 1.44) nor country of study (the USA: RE = 1.28; 95%CI = 1.13 - 1.45; other countries: RE = 1.25; 95%CI = 0.94 - 1.66). The sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the results. The funnel plot suggested no publication bias.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The current meta-analysis demonstrates that weight gain after age 18 is associated with increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women but not in premenopausal women. These findings suggest that it is important to keep weight within the healthy range and manage weight gain in adult life to fight against breast cancer among postmenopausal women.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b31dfc5-5270-4ae3-b02c-40c5a8061e29\/@B03B8ZD3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Obesity,Incidence,Risk factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13435"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yunan Han<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ebunoluwa E.

Using the full model, we assessed heterogeneity of associations by race\/ethnicity.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Over a mean of 19 years of follow-up, 2,398 incident UC cases were identified. The prevalence of T2D was highest among African Americans (15.7%), followed by Latinos (15.6%), Native Hawaiians (14.8%), Japanese Americans (10.5%), and non-Hispanic whites (5.9%). The age-standardized UC incidence rates were highest among whites (60\/100,000) followed by Japanese Americans (42\/100,000), Native Hawaiians (40\/100,000), African Americans (37\/100,000), and Latinos (29\/100,000). Incidence of UC was 1.11 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.26)-fold greater in those who reported a history of T2D, and this association differed between racial-ethnic groups (p<sub>heterogeneity<\/sub>=0.04). Estimates of the association between T2D and UC achieved statistical significance among African Americans (HR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.98) and Native Hawaiians (HR=1.68; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.60), but not among non-Hispanic whites (HR=1.06; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.43), Latinos (HR=0.96; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.29), or Japanese Americans (HR=0.95; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.21).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> In this multiethnic analysis, estimates of the association between T2DM and UC were strongest among African American and Native Hawaiian participants. The apparently stronger associations in these groups may be due to greater severity and\/or poorer control of T2DM. African Americans and Native Hawaiians may benefit from targeted interventions to better manage T2D in these populations to reduce risk of UC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2073fe84-4780-496a-9e74-dd13f5712549\/@C03B8ZD4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Cancer prevention,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13441"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Bogumil<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victoria Cortessis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lynne Wilkens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Wendy Setiawan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Haiman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loic Le Marchand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gertraud Maskarinec<\/i><\/presenter>.

Glucose intake enhances the secretion of insulin, may contribute to cell growth and proliferation, leading to CRC development. Epidemiologic studies have shown that individuals with diabetes history are at increased risk of CRC. A low-carbohydrate diet, represented by a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) score, may reduce the risk of diabetes. Yet, little is known about the association between LCD scores and the risk of CRC.<b> <\/b><br \/><b> <\/b><b>Methods.<\/b> We evaluated the associations between LCD and CRC risk in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a population-based prospective cohort study that includes 61,321 Chinese men and women in Singapore who were 45-74 years old at enrollment. Food and dietary supplement consumption were assessed by a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Participants were assigned a score from 0 to 10 according to their rankings by daily intake of calories from carbohydrates, fat and protein, respectively. A score of 0 was assigned to a subject ranked in the highest one-eleventh of calorie intake from carbohydrates or in the lowest one-eleventh of calories from fat or protein, respectively. In contrast, a score of 10 was given to each subject in the lowest one-eleventh of carbohydrate intake or the highest one-eleventh of fat or protein intake. The LCD score for each subject was the sum of the 3 individual ranking scores. The highest possible value was 30, which represented the lowest carbohydrate intake and the highest fat and protein. In addition, animal-based and plant-based LCDs were similarly created from the daily consumption of calories from animal or plant protein and fat, respectively, as well as carbohydrates. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC according to higher quartiles of LCD scores with adjustment for potential confounders.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> After an average of 17.5 years of follow-up, 2,140 participants developed CRC. Overall, there was a null association between total LCD and CRC risk. A moderate positive association was found for animal-based LCD with CRC risk. The multivariable-adjusted HRs(95%CIs) for CRC in quartiles 2, 3, and 4 of animal-based LCD were 1.12(0.99-1.26), 1.18(1.04-1.33), and 1.11(0.98-1.25)(<i>P<sub>trend<\/sub><\/i>=0.06) compared with the lowest quartile. There were no statistically significant differences in the animal-based LCD and CRC risk in subgroups stratified by sex, body mass index, smoking status, and history of type 2 diabetes.<br \/><b>Conclusions.<\/b> This large population-based prospective cohort study shows that a high animal-based LCD score, which represented low intake of carbohydrates and high intake of animal protein and fat, was associated with ~10% increased risk of CRC. Our findings suggest that replacing low-carbohydrate food with animal-based food may increase the risk of developing CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f49a0ef-4a03-4de3-a436-94f1db9c7343\/@C03B8ZD4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Diet,Epidemiology,Cancer prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13445"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yi-Chuan Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pedram Paragomi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aizhen Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renwei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert E.

Infertility is also characterized by various underlying causes and can be treated with different types of fertility drugs. However, most studies to date have been unable to properly address these important issues when examining the infertility-ovarian cancer association due to small numbers of patients and a lack of detailed infertility and risk factor information.<br \/><i>Methods<\/i>: We pooled self-reported data from 8,324 invasive, epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 13,325 control women in eight population-based case-control studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC) to study the infertility-ovarian cancer relationship. Women classified as having a history of infertility were those who had spoken to a doctor about infertility problems or those who had regular sexual intercourse without birth control for a prolonged period (usually one year) without getting pregnant. Cause of infertility as well as use of fertility drugs was examined among those who experienced infertility issues. These associations with risk of ovarian cancer were evaluated using logistic regression models and quantified using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Gravidity and endometriosis were considered in the analyses as well as potential confounding factors.<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: Overall, infertility was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.95-1.09). However, women who reported their infertility was due to problems with ovulation or menstruation showed a decreased risk (OR=0.72, 95% CI 0.52-1.01 and OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.91, respectively) whereas women who reported their infertility was due to endometriosis were at an increased risk (OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.19-1.98). Among women who reported infertility issues, use of fertility drugs was not associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer regardless of their gravidity status (OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.76-1.05).<br \/><i>Conclusions<\/i>: The relationship between infertility and risk of ovarian cancer is complex. Although infertility does not appear to be an independent risk factor for ovarian cancer, specific causes of infertility may be differentially associated with ovarian cancer risk, which may shed light on the disease&#8217;s underlying etiology. In addition, for women experiencing infertility issues, use of fertility drugs did not show an increased risk of ovarian cancer, which may have important clinical implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/117e7530-51f6-4413-b50c-a29ee318ded7\/@C03B8ZD4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Risk factors,Epidemiology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13447"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alice W.

Several MM treatments including receiving immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), cytotoxic chemotherapy, and high-dose dexamethasone also increase VTE risk. Clinical guidelines recommend thromboprophylactic regimens to mitigate the risk of VTE in MM patients. However, practices vary with respect to medications used for thromboprophylaxis, ranging from prescribing of aspirin to anticoagulant regimens with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and warfarin. We aimed to describe patterns of warfarin- and DOAC-based thromboprophylaxis in newly diagnosed MM patients initiating IMiD-based treatment.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of MM patients using the IBM MarketScan <i>Commercial Claims and Encounters <\/i>and Medicare Supplemental databases. We included newly diagnosed MM patients initiating IMiD-based treatment between 2010 and 2017 with continuous health plan enrollment 12 months prior to and following diagnosis. We collected information on comorbidities, VTE risk factors and other MM therapies. The primary outcome of interest was initiating thromboprophylaxis with warfarin or DOAC within 90 days of treatment initiation. We evaluated prescribing trends over time and characteristics associated with DOAC- or warfarin-based thromboprophylaxis, we used univariate and multivariate multinomial logistic regression models comparing these two forms of thromboprophylaxis to those who did not receive thromboprophylaxis.<br \/>Results: In a cohort of 6227 MM patients initiating IMiD-based regimens, the median age was 62 years and 43% were female. Over the entire study period, warfarin-based thromboprophylaxis was more prevalent relative to DOACs (10.5% vs. 6.9%). However, we observed a trend of increasing adoption of DOAC thromboprophylaxis from 2.4% of patients in 2010 to 12.7% in 2017; and the use of warfarin thromboprophylaxis consistently declined over time from 16.5% of patients in 2010 to 3.2% in 2017. In multivariable analyses, trends associated with increasing or decreasing odds of thromboprophylaxis with these agents were robust after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics including VTE risk factors and other MM treatment (DOAC: OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.28-1.44 and warfarin: OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.86).<br \/>Conclusions: Over the study period, our findings indicate that DOAC-based thromobprophylaxis regimens were increasingly used over warfarin-based treatment in newly diagnosed commercially insured MM patients initiating IMiD therapy. Further research is needed to determine whether these patterns are associated with differences in clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2c62b68-8d0f-4c7e-87ba-0bfbf0acc031\/@C03B8ZD4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-16 Pharmacoepidemiology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Immunomodulation,Cohort study,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13602"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Abdullah I.

Prior studies of ACS guideline adherence have relied on self-reported leisure physical activity (PA), which shows low correlations and may inaccurately estimate objectively assessed activity in Hispanic\/Latino adults. We examined variations in guideline adherence score and levels according to how moderate to vigorous (self-reported and accelerometer-measured) physical activity (MVPA) was operationalized in the Hispanic Community Health Study\/Study of Latinos (HCHS\/SOL) cohort. Data were from 16,415 adults enrolled in the HCHS\/SOL between 2008-2011 from the Bronx, Chicago, Miami and San Diego. Following ACS guidelines, we categorized dietary scores (derived from quartiles of proportion of whole grain, quartiles of red and processed meat, fruit &#38; vegetables (&#60;5, &#8805;5 servings\/day), and tertiles of total carotenoids), alcohol intake, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI). Behaviors were scored from 0 (least adherent) to 2 (most adherent): BMI &#60; 25, 25 to &#60;30, or &#8805; 30 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>; 0-2, 3-6, 7-9 diet points; no alcohol, &#62;0 - &#8804;1 drink\/day women\/0- &#8804;2 drink\/day men, more alcohol). PA was operationalized as: (1) self-reported leisure and (2) accelerometer-measured MVPA as 0 mins\/week, &#62;0 to 150 mins\/week of moderate activity or &#62;0 to &#60;=75 mins\/week of vigorous activity, &#62;150 mins\/week moderate activity or &#62;75 mins\/week of vigorous and (3) self-reported total (leisure, work, and transportation) MVPA as &#60;8.75 MET-h\/week, 8.75 to 17.75 MET-h\/week, &#62;17.5 MET-h\/week. Components were summed with possible range of &#8220;0&#8221; (does not meet recommendations) to &#8220;8&#8221; (meets all recommendations), and further categorized as low (0-3), moderate (4-5), and high (6-8) adherence. Weighted Chi-square tests compared the three scores.<b><\/b> Overall mean ACS guideline adherence &#177; standard error (SE) was 3.7 &#177; 0.03 when using leisure-MVPA, 5.3 &#177; 0.02 for total-MVPA and 4.0 &#177; 0.2 for accelerometer-measured MVPA. Percentages for low, moderate, and high guideline adherence differed by PA measure used: self-report leisure-MVPA (49.4%, 40.1%, 10.6%, respectively), self-report total-MVPA (14.9%, 40.8%, and 44.3%, respectively), and accelerometer-measured MVPA (33.2%, 53.2%, and 13.6%, respectively). Differences were found for leisure vs. total-MVPA (p=0.000); leisure vs. accelerometer-measured MVPA (p=0.000); and total vs. accelerometer-measured MVPA (p=0.000). Level of ACS guideline adherence among Hispanic\/Latino adults is dependent on how MVPA is measured and operationalized. Our study demonstrates potential misclassification in the level of ACS guideline adherence in studies operationalizing ACS adherence scores based solely on self-reported leisure MVPA data for this population. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cfed0d31-b0c6-4ada-97de-737308688a8c\/@C03B8ZD4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Nutrition and Physical activity,Hispanic\/Latinos,Cancer prevention guidelines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13443"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Margaret Saira Pichardo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Pichardo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheila F.

Gene expression profiling has identified two major biologically distinctive DLBCL subtypes defined by their cell-of-origin (COO): germinal center B-cell (GCB) - characterized by <i>BCL2<\/i> rearrangement and C-REL amplification, and activated B-cell (ABC) - characterized by constitutive activation of the NF-kB pathway. We evaluated putative DLBCL risk factors for etiologic heterogeneity as defined by COO.<br \/>Methods: We used a clinic-based study of newly diagnosed NHL cases and frequency matched controls, enrolled from 2002-2014, with a total of 687 DLBCL cases and 2253 controls for this analysis. Using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, we determined COO by either digital expression profiling (NanoString; classified as GCB, ABC, undetermined) or clinically using the Hans algorithm (immunohistochemical markers; classified as GCB, non-GCB, undetermined). Integrating these two sources of COO data, there were 271 GCB, 170 non-GCB, and 246 undetermined\/missing (mainly due to lack of tissue) cases. Risk factor data were collected from self-administered questionnaires and included family history of hematologic malignancy; history of atopy, allergy, asthma, eczema, or autoimmune disease; blood transfusion; vaccination history; regular low-dose aspirin use; body mass index (BMI) 2 years prior diagnosis\/ enrollment; smoking history; alcohol consumption (never\/current\/former); leisure-time physical activity; and recreational sun exposure. Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for COO subtypes, adjusted for age, sex and residence.<br \/>Results: The median age of cases was 64 years with 55% male; the median age of controls was 64 years and 53% male. The association with BMI (30+ vs. 18.5-24.9 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) was stronger for non-GCB (OR=2.21; 1.40-3.49) than for GCB (OR=1.70; 1.21-2.40) DLBCL (P-heterogeneity 0.02), while a family history of hematologic malignancy was associated with non-GCB (OR=2.27; 1.47-3.50) but not GCB (OR=1.30; 0.86-1.96) DLBCL, although the P-heterogeneity was not significant (P=0.13). For GCB, there was an inverse association with former (vs. never) alcohol use for GCB (OR=0.57; 0.39-0.83) but not for non-GCB (OR=0.98; 0.61-1.57) DLBCL (P-heterogeneity 0.007), and an inverse association with regular use of low-dose aspirin for GCB (OR=0.64; 0.47-0.87) but not for non-GCB (OR=0.88; 0.61-1.25) DLBCL (P-heterogeneity 0.05). No other risk factors evaluated showed important heterogeneity by COO.<br \/>Conclusions: These initial results suggest most DLBCL risk factors do not show etiologic heterogeneity by DLBCL COO, although associations with BMI and family history with non-GCB DLBCL and alcohol and low-dose aspirin use with GCB DLBCL warrant follow-up.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72479c0e-8693-464c-bd5f-18cf6b617460\/@C03B8ZD4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Risk factors,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Body mass index,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13440"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Geffen Kleinstern<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis P.
