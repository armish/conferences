[{"Abstract":"The reprogramming of cellular metabolism is an important hallmark of cancer allowing tumor cells to survive and proliferate. Recent data revealed that subsets of ovarian cancer with invasive and metastatic phenotype are highly metabolically active with increased mitochondrial respiration. To better understand the metabolic profiles of ovarian cancer, we utilized patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) derived from high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), and performed comprehensive analysis of metabolic pathways by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA). The RPPA analysis revealed PDX subsets with high or low mitochondrial activity and metabolism, and we identified succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA) to be a top differentially expressed metabolic protein between those PDX subsets. SDHA is a mitochondrial enzyme that participates in the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain, which are both essential for cellular metabolism. Analysis of the TCGA data demonstrated that <i>SDHA<\/i> gene alterations are highly prevalent in HGSOC patients (19% cases). Despite these findings, the impact of SDHA amplification on cancer biology is poorly understood. To assess the effect of SDHA overexpression on energy metabolism, we used SDHA-overexpressing ovarian cancer cell lines and measured cellular respiration by Seahorse. The results revealed that the overexpression of SDHA leads to a significant increase in basal and maximal respiration shifting cellular metabolism towards increased oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Further, we determined if SDHA overexpression redirects cellular metabolism in response to deprivation of selected nutrients. In the conditions with low glucose or glutamine, SDHA overexpressing cells significantly increased basal respiration when compared with controls. In galactose medium that disrupts glycolysis, the SDHA lost its ability to induce cellular respiration, which indicates that SDHA relays on glycolysis to increase mitochondrial respiration. Together, our data indicate that SDHA requires glycolysis to fuel TCA cycle and and support cellular respiration. Next, we performed <i>in vitro<\/i> drug screening and found that SDHA overexpressing cells are highly sensitive to glycolysis inhibitor Shikonin. Our pilot <i>in vivo<\/i> data showed that Shikonin significantly reduces growth of SDHA-amplified tumors. In summary, our studies indicate that SDHA upregulation plays a role in reprogramming of cellular metabolism and pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Moreover, the unique metabolic state of ovarian cancer associated with SDHA amplification could be successfully targetable offering a potential new treatment strategy for ovarian cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7f679e8b-e8ae-4a21-9f35-8ea0fe62419d\/@v03B8ZXy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Ovarian cancer,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Magdalena Cybula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Rostworowska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Summer Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Luiza Drumond-Bock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Magdalena Bieniasz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

As such, there is considerable interest in targeting mitochondrial OXPHOS in cancer. The present project was based on the premise that the development of efficacious mitochondrial-targeted anti-cancer compounds requires answering two fundamental questions: 1) is mitochondrial bioenergetics in fact different between cancer and non-cancer cells? and 2) If so, what are the underlying mechanisms? To address these questions, we developed a methodological workflow designed to integrate in vitro functional readouts of mitochondrial flux with mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. This allowed us to directly quantitate both total respiratory capacity and OXPHOS kinetics on a per mitochondrion basis. Experiments were performed in isolated mitochondria prepared from freshly resected human colorectal adenocarcinomas (COAD). Relative to adjacent normal colonic mucosa, tumor mitochondria consistently presented with partial disruptions in respiratory complex I (CI). Surprisingly, CI functional limitations did not impair absolute oxidative flux. Instead, the tumor mitochondrial network displayed clear evidence of intrinsic remodeling. Such remodeling maintained respiratory competence at the expense of decreased oxidative ATP synthesis (i.e., OXPHOS inefficiency or increased &#8216;uncoupling&#8217;). Given recent findings demonstrating that mitochondrial OXPHOS is dispensable for tumor growth, our data raise the intriguing possibility that the requirement for mitochondria in COAD may have little to do with oxidative ATP production, but instead reflect a requirement for accelerated mitochondrial flux to support other aspects of anabolic growth (e.g., extracellular nutrient uptake, NAD<sup>+<\/sup> regeneration, nucleotide synthesis). In this respect, rather than functioning as energy producers, COAD mitochondria may primarily function as &#8216;energy sinks&#8217;.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b8fe0cc4-aa24-46cd-8f6b-8fb5646daa0b\/@v03B8ZXy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Cancer metabolism,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ilya Boykov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>McLane M.

Here, we assessed the contribution of the tumor suppressor, Annexin A6 (AnxA6) in the metabolic adaptation of rapidly growing versus invasive TNBC cells as well as in Lapatinib resistant (Lap-R) TNBC cells. AnxA6 expression in cultured TNBC cell lines, Lap-R cells and in crude isolates of mitochondria was determined by Western blotting and\/or immunofluorescence assays. The oxygen consumption rates (OCR), extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) and mitochondria activity were assessed using the Seahorse XF Analyzer. Intracellular metabolites were detected by 1H-NMR analysis. Using model proliferative basal-like and invasive mesenchymal-like TNBC cell lines, we show that TNBC cells also exhibit metabolic heterogeneity. Down regulation of AnxA6 in TNBC cells attenuated mitochondrial respiration, glycolytic flux, and cellular ATP production capacity, resulting in a quiescent cellular energy phenotype. We further show that AnxA6-depletion was associated with decreased lipid droplet accumulation and the lipolytic phenotype by enhancing the uptake and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation for ATP production. Chronic Lapatinib-induced up regulation of AnxA6 in AnxA6-low TNBC cells reversed their lipolytic to a more lipogenic\/glycolytic metabolic phenotype with gluconeogenic precursors as additional metabolites. Collectively, these data suggest that the expression status of AnxA6 in TNBC cells underlies significant metabolic adaptation during stress and\/or chronic Lapatinib treatment and provide additional insights into the potential of AnxA6 as a biomarker for not only therapeutic intervention but also the metabolic subtyping of TNBC subsets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/70b870b0-97b7-4344-acf3-8735c138b33b\/@w03B8ZXz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,EGFR TKI resistance,Mitochondria,Lipid metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen D.

We have previously developed an oHSV that encodes for PTEN&#945; (HSV-P10) and stimulates anti-tumor immunity. This virus is currently licensed by and is being developed by Mesoblast to evaluate safety and efficacy in patients. To understand the effect of PTEN&#945; on tumor cell responses to oHSV therapy we performed RNA sequencing of primary GBM cells infected with control or oHSV-P10. We identified a dysregulation of glycolysis in cells infected with oHSV-P10 relative to control oHSV. Since cancer cells rely heavily on glycolysis for energy production (Warburg effect) the impact of PTEN&#945; on metabolic switch was significant. RNA sequencing PCR and western blot analysis showed a significant reduction in cellular Hexokinase II expression and downregulation of HIF-1&#945; in HSV-P10 infected cells. Consistent with the function of HIF1 and hexokinase in driving glycolysis we also observed a significant reduction in glucose uptake and lactate release: implying a reduction in glycolysis in cells after being treated with oHSV-P10. Thus, cellular energetics of HSV-P10 infected cells was directed away from glycolysis relative to HSVQ infected cells. Consistent with this we observed increased, oxidative phosphorylation, production of reactive oxidative species and ATP production. Many cancers, including Glioblastoma are known to utilize the glutamine as a substrate for energy production through its entry into the TCA cycle. Blocking this shows a significant decrease in cell viability and ATP production when combined with HSV-P10. These results indicate that combination of HSV-P10 with radiation has a significant therapeutic potential and should be tested in patients for safety and efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30961e33-b7fb-45d0-88b9-ad1b95dd1369\/@w03B8ZXz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,PTEN,Oncolytic virus,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew P.

These small-molecule compounds can be used as a stand-alone treatment approach or may be combined with other compounds to bring enhanced effects. Compound therapeutic discovery relies heavily on high-throughput screening assays for measurement of phenotypic responses following compound treatment of oncology cell cultures which can range from very targeted assays to wide-ranging unbiased approaches. Standard whole transcriptome RNA-seq is a preferred method for unbiased measurement of phenotypic responses but is often overlooked due to limited scalability and high sample screening costs.<br \/>To address these challenges, we have developed a high-throughput gene expression (HT-GEx) assay that combines a variety of strategies to enable a low-cost and high-throughput alternative to standard RNA-seq. First, a simplified workflow removes upstream RNA isolation steps and tags transcripts directly from cell lysate. This is achieved by incorporating both a sample barcode and a unique molecular index (UMI) during the reverse transcription reaction. Next, we leverage a 3&#8217; end counting approach to enable a reduction in sequencing depth coverage (i.e. sample cost) without compromising gene detection sensitivity. With these key advances, a high-plex and high-throughput screening assay is achievable at a reduced cost by removing the need to purify RNA, tagging transcripts early in the workflow to allow pooling of samples and reducing sequencing depth. We have combined these high-throughput and cost-saving strategies and present results which confirm HT-GEx offers results on par with standard RNA-seq. Gene detection sensitivity based on number of genes detected per millions of reads is highly similar, with gene detection sensitivity saturated at approximately 2 million reads. Additionally, the number of genes detected between replicates for RNA samples and lysate samples demonstrate strong linear correlation, implying highly reproducible results. Thus, high-throughput gene expression is an ideal method for phenotypic screening in oncology cell lines following stand-alone or combined compound treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fe2068c3-4ecb-4abe-aa9d-3341b0e70f72\/@w03B8ZXz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),High-throughput assay,Gene expression profiling,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrea O'Hara<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Stephens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilaria DeVito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laure Turner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Mozdzierz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haythem Latif<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ginger Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>.

Chemotherapy remains the first-line treatment for TNBC. Despite the great research efforts, above half of TNBC patients have developed drug resistance after chemotherapies. Thus, the study of chemo-resistance and identification of novel targets are critical to improving TNBC treatment. In our study, we compared genomic profiles between TNBC cell lines and patients' samples and selected the most representative one, MDA-MB-231,for TNBC chemotherapy-poor responders. Then, Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen and RNAseq were performed in MDA-MB-231 to identify potential synthetic lethal targets to Cisplatin\/ Doxorubicin.<br \/>To identify cell lines that correspond to poor responder patients, we selected genomic profiles of 17 good responders, 36 poor responders, and 21 TNBC cell lines from GEO database. We used Hierarchical clustering analysis, Spearman's rank correlation, and GSEA analysis to determine the representative cell lines in gene expression level and pathway level. With the results from our analysis, MDA-MB-231 is most representative among 21 TNBC cell lines.&nbsp;<br \/>To identify essential genes and pathways for cell survival under Cisplatin\/ Doxorubicin treatment, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in MDA-MB-231 and introduced CRISPR library TKOV3 into cells by lentivirus. After puromycin selection, the surviving cells were treated with Cisplatin\/ Doxorubicin for 21 days and sgRNAs were sequenced at ~80 million reads per sample to achieve a 600x coverage over the TKOV3 library. To accurate the CRISPR-Cas9 screen results and capture the transcriptomic changes during the Cisplatin\/ Doxorubicin treatment, we performed RNAseq from MDA-MD-231 after treating in&nbsp;same drug conditions matched with the CRISPR screen.&nbsp;By the&nbsp;MAGeCK&nbsp;algorithm, we generated the list of candidate genes that can form a synthetic lethal partnership with Cisplatin\/ Doxorubicin. Our negative selection screen confirmed that loss of essential genes from DNA damage repair and regulation of DNA replication pathways, such as BCL2L1, ATM, CDC25B, NBN, sensitizes cells to Cisplatin\/ Doxorubicin, which has been reported in DNA damage drug synthetic lethal studies. Meanwhile, our analysis also revealed hundreds of unrecognized genes involved in the G2\/M DNA damage checkpoint, AMPK signaling pathway,&nbsp;mTOR signaling pathway, and Hsp90-mediated&nbsp;pathways. In addition, the pathways related to transcriptomic response to Cisplatin\/ Doxorubicin from RNAseq data show many differences with essential pathways shown in the CRISPR screen, which proposed a complex regulation system in cell response to DNA damage drug.&nbsp;<br \/>In general, Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen along with transcriptome RNAseq is efficient to identify essential genes that have potential synthetic lethal interaction with Cisplatin\/Doxorubicin. This provides new opportunities for combination therapies in TNBC chemo-resistant patients.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,CRISPR\/Cas9,Cisplatin resistance,Doxorubicin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shuai Shao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shan Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xue Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yue Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huo Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lijun Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lang Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the multiple role(s) of EGFR in breast cancer are not fully elucidated. In this study, we characterized a unique antiestrogen resistant breast cancer subline and provide compelling data that upregulation of the EGFR\/MEK1\/MAPK1\/2 signaling axis during antiestrogen treatment facilitated escape from senescence, autophagy, and BimEL-dependent apoptosis. Our studies were conducted with the antiestrogen resistant TR5 cell line established by our laboratory, using a step-wise drug selection with the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) of the estrogen receptor &#945; (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells. A preliminary microarray comparing mRNA expression between 4-OHT-selected TR5 cells and MCF-7 parent cells identified upregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Western blot showed a greater than 5-fold upregulation of EGFR expression and downregulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) compared to the levels in MCF-7 and T47-D (antiestrogen sensitive). Selective inhibition of EGFR, phosphorylated at Tyr 1068, was achieved with erlotinib. Inhibition blocked MEK1\/MAPK1\/2 signaling, which was also upregulated in 4-OHT selected TR5 cells, with detectable increases in the pro-apoptotic BH3 protein BimEL, and a fifty percent reduction in cell viability. However, a high number of cells survived erlotinib therapy due to autophagy induction determined to be cytoprotective. Autophagy induction was identified by analyzing the expression\/ turnover of autophagy proteins LC3-II and p62, a standard approach to ascertain autophagy levels in cells. Further, erlotinib treatment induced a 2-fold increase in the number of senescent cells in the surviving population. Senescent cells were identified by &#946;-galactosidase staining of erlotinib-treated cells utilizing confocal microscopy. Interestingly, blockade of autophagy with the lysosomotrophic compound chloroquine enhanced the senescence cell population, suggesting that either autophagy blocked senescence induction or lysosome impairment increased senescence. Mechanistically, we have identified phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) as being elevated under conditions of erlotinib treatment, and reduced in 4-OHT-selected TR5 cells relative to MCF-7 parent cells. This correlation supports the hypothesis that pAMPK was downregulated during 4-OHT selection of TR5 cells by elevated EGFR\/MEK\/MAPK1\/2 signaling to allow surviving cells escape senescence induction and\/or anti-proliferative autophagy. Overall we propose that EGFR mediated downregulation of pAMPK is a major regulatory pathway in breast cancer cells surviving endocrine treatment. Our current studies are dissecting the role of EGFR-mediated AMPK regulation with somatic cell-based studies and pharmacological intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bc8ca9cd-6e9c-4cfc-b8c5-be6970b7c2c6\/@w03B8ZXz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-04 Senescence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,Autophagy,EGFR,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mackenzie L.

Despite their shared mutant C-termini and mutual ability to bind and activate MPL, patients with type 1 and type 2 CALR mutations display significant clinical and prognostic differences. Type 1 mutations are primarily associated with an MF phenotype and a higher risk of fibrotic transformation from ET, while type 2 mutations are more common in ET. Molecularly, type 2 CALR mutant proteins retain many of the calcium binding sites present in the wild type protein, while type 1 CALR mutant proteins lose these residues. The functional consequences of this differential loss of calcium binding sites remain yet unexplored. Current targeted therapies for <i>CALR<\/i> mutated MPN are not curative, and treatment does not differentiate between type 1 versus type 2 mutant CALR-driven disease, despite the different phenotypic and prognostic outcomes in these patients. In order to improve treatment strategies for <i>CALR<\/i> mutated MPN patients, it is critical to identify specific dependencies unique to each CALR mutation type that can be exploited for therapeutic gain. Here, we show that type 1 CALRdel52 but not type 2 CALRins5 mutations lead to activation of and dependency on the IRE1&#945;-XBP1 pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Mechanistically, we found that the loss of calcium binding residues in the type 1 mutant CALR protein directly impairs its calcium binding ability, which in turn leads to depleted ER calcium and<br \/>subsequent activation of the IRE1&#945;-XBP1 pathway. Using cell lines and primary MPN patient samples, we identified two novel transcriptional targets of XBP1 specific to CALRdel52-expressing cells - the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and the calcium efflux channel IP3R. We show that BCL-2 acts downstream of XBP1 to promote survival in the face of depleted ER calcium, while IP3R is up-regulated downstream of XBP1 to promote continued ER calcium efflux in order to sustain IRE1&#945;-XBP1 pathway activation and survival. We found that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of IRE1&#945;-XBP1 signaling induced cell death only in type 1 mutant but not type 2 mutant or wild type CALR-expressing cells. Moreover, we show that <i>in vivo<\/i> inhibition of IRE1&#945; significantly abrogates type 1 mutant CALR-driven disease in a bone marrow transplantation model. This work is the first to demonstrate that type 1 and type 2 mutant CALR-expressing cells display differential molecular dependencies that can be exploited for therapeutic gain. Moreover, this study answers an enduring question regarding the functional consequence of the loss of calcium binding sites on the type 1 mutant CALR protein, and demonstrates how type 1 CALR mutant-expressing cells rewire the UPR, downstream calcium signaling, and apoptotic pathways to drive MPN.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ba465527-a358-45a3-be45-21d8d4642ea9\/@w03B8ZXz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Unfolded protein response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Calcium,Unfolded protein response (UPR),Bcl-2 protein family,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juan Ibarra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yassmin Elbanna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katarzyna Kurylowicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Ciboddo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harrison S.

This research expands on our previous studies investigating the ability of DFP to alter metabolism of breast and prostate cancer tumors and enhance treatment response. We used the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, unpolarized (M0) &#38; polarized (to M1 by LPS, to M2 by IL-4), <i>in vitro<\/i> to evaluate the effects of DFP on macrophage (i) doubling times (cell count assay), (ii) polarization (flow cytometry), (iii) functional response by measuring cytokine (IL-12, IL-10, TNF&#945;), secretion (Luminex multiplex cytokine detection system, Millipore), phagocytosis (IgG-coated latex beads), and reactive oxygen species production (fluorometric detection), (iv) glycolytic and oxidative metabolism (Agilent xFe96 analyzer), and (v) glycolytic metabolism (measuring incorporation of 1-<sup>13<\/sup>C-glucose by <sup>1<\/sup>H &#38; <sup>13<\/sup>C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of cell extracts and supernatants). The EC<sub>50<\/sub>s of 48 h DFP exposure are 79&#177;5 &#181;M, 93&#177;3 &#181;M, and 114&#177;5 &#181;M for M0, M1, and M2-polarized RAW 264.7 cells, respectively. The effect of DFP is cytostatic and increases cell doubling times. Exposure to 100 &#181;M DFP for 48 h increases the number of M1-polarized cells in M0 and M1 cultures, but not in M2-polarized cells. While M2-polarized cells secreted more anti-inflammatory IL-10 and less pro-inflammatory TNF&#945; than M0 cells, their cytokine secretion was unaffected by DFP. M1-polarized cells stimulated the secretion of TNF&#945; and IL-10. The IL-10 secretion may be a feedback mechanism to curtail the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS. DFP decreased IL-10 secretion by ~33% in M1-polarized cells, enhancing their M1 activation state. IL-12 secretion was minimal and inconsistent. The ~21% phagocytosis in M0 cells remained unchanged by M2 polarization and increased to ~37% in M1-polarized cells. DFP exposure increased phagocytosis efficiency in M0, M1, and M2-polarized cells but highest in M1 cells. While no detectable H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> was produced, RAW 264.7 cells make detectable nitric oxide (NO), with M1-polarized cells yielding the most NO. NO yield was unchanged by DFP. Like the results above, we found the greatest effect of DFP to be on mitochondrial metabolism in M1 macrophages, specifically, significant reductions of maximal, basal, and ATP-linked respiration. The increased suppression of oxidative metabolism in M1-polarized macrophages by DFP conforms with the observed reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The DFP increased phagocytosis, specifically dominant in M1 macrophages, suggests an increased reliance on glycolysis. To support the above observations, we currently study the incorporation of 1-<sup>13<\/sup>C-Glucose into cellular metabolites of M0, M1, and M2-polarized cells without &#38; with DFP. Our data support a pro-inflammatory effect of DFP on macrophages, which may enhance their anti-tumor effect <i>in vivo<\/i> through altering tumor and macrophage metabolism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/83b0e8ce-a552-4d65-a2e6-d5c43e4c88ae\/@w03B8ZXz\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Deferiprone,Metabolism,Magnetic resonance spectroscopy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ellen Ackerstaff<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadna Budhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dov P.

The key hurdles to effective treatment for GBM, the &#8220;most deadly&#8221; form of brain cancer, are resistance to chemotherapy, to radiation, and to immune check point inhibitor therapy. The overarching goal of our experiments has been to determine if a well-characterized small molecule inhibitor of PI3K, GCT.Glio.1, would improve treatment outcomes for GBM patients. The PI3K pathway has been shown to confer both chemotherapy and radiation resistance in GBM. GCT.Glio.1 (NPT520-337), a small molecule compound known to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), was developed to target PI3K to treat GBM. GBMs, like other &#8220;difficult to treat&#8221; tumors, often over-express and actively utilize the PI3K pathway for survival, cell growth, and cell division. We used this small molecule inhibitor to determine how targeting the PI3K pathway impacts treatment resistance in GBM. We hypothesized that targeting PI3K would result in growth arrest, increase cell surface expression of a key immune check-point inhibitor target PD-L1, and would sensitize the GBM to treatment with radiation. Treatment of GL261 mouse GBM and U251 human GBM cell lines with GCT.Glio.1 resulted in profound growth arrest at the G2\/M checkpoint, increased the cell surface expression of PD-L1, and synergized with radiation to cause growth arrest and subsequent cell death. In conclusion, these results indicate that GCT.Glio.1 may be a strong candidate for treatment of GBM, and suggest that GCT.Glio.1 is a candidate for rationally designed combinations with currently available radiation and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Currently, the animal studies using GCT.Glio.1 in the GL261 mouse model of GBM have been initiated. Based on our promising pre-clinical data and early encouraging results from pre-clinical pharmacology and safety studies, we anticipate filing a pre-Investigational New Drug application (pre-IND) as the next step toward our goal of a clinical trial using GCT.Glio.1 for GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6931180b-7310-426f-969c-a831cfce4f97\/@x03B8ZXA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 Cell cycle checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Glioblastoma multiforme,Cell cycle checkpoints,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ekokobe Fonkem<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>M.

N-MYC and activated CDK9 act as oncogenic drivers sufficient to transform human-derived prostate cancer cells to take on NEPC phenotypic changes resulting in a more aggressive disease identified in late-stage human PC patients. Additionally, N-MYC is required for tumor resistance, and its downregulation through CDK9 inhibitors lessens the tumor burden. Our efforts in this study have proven that the targeting of N-NYC as a driver of NEPC with CDK9 inhibitors such as BLX-3030 and its series could be a viable approach for therapeutic intervention of mCRPC and NEPCs.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: Utilizing our FIELDS fragment-based design strategies, we have developed and synthesized a series of novel small molecule CDK9 agents that reversibly bind to CDK9, competitively block the ATP site, and elicit pharmacological responses in N-MYC and other prostate cancer cells<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vitro<\/i>. CDK9 cell-free kinase binding, CDKs selectivity,<i> <\/i><i>p<\/i>CDK9 inhibition assays were performed and confirmed its on-target efficacy and potency of lead CDK9 inhibitor BLX-3030.<br \/>Results and Summary: In these studies, our lead CDK9 kinase inhibitor BLX-3030 from over 60 plus analogs demonstrated potent activity with an IC50 of &#60;5 nM in inhibiting CDK9. CDK9 and N-MYC expression has been detected in PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP, and in LASCPC-01, NCI-H660 and 22RV1 cell lines. HCI-3030 exhibited potent cellular efficacy with an IC50 of 22 to 590 nM in PC cell lines and in N-MYC expressed cells had an activity of 76, 470, and 132 nM respectively and reduced<i> <\/i><i>p<\/i>CDK9, C-MYC, Mcl-1, N-MYC and its downstream RNA Pol II (Ser-2) and<i> <\/i><i>p<\/i>AR (Ser-81) dose-dependently. Our preliminary results support the hypothesis that inhibition of CDK9 reinstates anti-tumor and blocks tumor progression in both mCRPC and NEPCs cellular models. BLX-3030 and a few of its analogs had excellent PK properties in mouse species in the range of 28-94% F, low clearance, and &#62;3 hours half-life. BLX-3030 is nominated as a pre-clinical agent for additional 3D, FACS\/apoptosis, cell migration, live-cell imaging including immunofluorescent studies along with<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vivo<\/i> prostate cancer mouse model efficacy studies as well and these results will be presented.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, a series of BLX-3030, its analogs as CDK9 inhibitors, display a range of potency in prostate cancer and NEPC cells with ideal PK parameters, were identified. Within compounds of this profile, BLX-3030 was selected as a candidate CDK9 inhibitor upon in-depth evaluation of the in vitro and in Vivo PK properties further supporting our conclusion that BLX-3030 had the appropriate qualities for development as a pre-clinical candidate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c69320ed-c37c-450e-8ef7-809e6826accc\/@x03B8ZXA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"N-myc,Small molecule inhibitor,Prostate cancer,Neuroendocrine tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyle Medley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaoliang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saisha Vankayalapati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sowmya Paritala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongqing Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Coffman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neeraj Agarwal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David J.

In breast and other cancer types, genes involved in lipogenesis are highly upregulated, but the mechanisms that control their expression remain poorly understood. DAXX modulates gene expression through binding to numerous transcription factors although the functional impact of these diverse interactions remains to be defined. Our recent analysis indicates that DAXX is overexpressed in diverse cancer types and metastases. However, mechanisms underlying DAXX&#8217;s oncogenic function remains elusive. Using global integrated transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses, we show that DAXX plays a key role in lipid metabolism in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. DAXX depletion attenuates, while its overexpression enhances, lipogenic gene expression, lipid synthesis and tumor growth. Mechanistically, DAXX interacts with SREBP1 and SREBP2 and activates SREBP-mediated transcription. DAXX associates with lipogenic gene promoters through SREBPs. Underscoring the critical roles for the DAXX-SREBP interaction for lipogenesis, SREBP2 knockdown attenuates tumor growth in cells with DAXX overexpression, and a DAXX mutant unable to bind SREBPs are incapable of promoting lipogenesis and tumor growth. In TNBC patients, DAXX expression levels are increased in breast cancer brain metastasis and correlate with poor patient survival. Our results identify the DAXX-SREBP axis as an important pathway for tumorigenesis in TNBC.

However, despite this success, only a minority of them respond to ICIs, with 10-40% objective response rate. The clinical experience with ICIs has identified several potential biomarkers associated with treatment efficacy, including tumor mutational burden, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-L1 expression, and intestinal microbiota, but they still have not been useful in clinical practice. Our study aimed to investigate the influences of RNA gene signature and spatial distribution of immune cells on the treatment outcomes of malignant melanoma patients receiving ICIs.<br \/>Method Clinical: data were retrospectively collected malignant melanoma patients who had been treated with ICIs between Jan. 2016 and Dec. 2018 at Seoul St. Mary&#8217;s Hospitals. Among them, 23 cases with sufficient tumor tissue to examine RNA expression profile by NGS and the composition, and spatial distance of immune cells by multiplex immunofluorescent staining.<br \/>Results: The cell densities of T cells, cytotoxic T cells, Treg cells, CD8+Treg cells, and exhausted T cells in the good response group tended to be higher, which was clearer in the peritumoral (PT) area than the intratumoral (IT) area. Meanwhile, the cell densities of macrophage and activated M1 were significantly higher, which was more pronounced in the IT area than the PT area. For the good response group, M1\/M2 ratio in the IT area was significantly higher compared to that of poor response group (p=0.045). The distribution (%) of cancer cells present at a close distance from T cells in the PT area was relatively higher in the good responders compared to that of the poor responders. In most cases, the distribution of cancer cells (%) present at a close distance from M1, M2, and NK cells tended to be higher in the IT area than PT area. For the cases with higher distribution of cancer cells at a close distance from M1 in the IT area, OS was significantly extended (p=0.036). For the cases with higher distribution of cancer cells at a close distance from NK cells in the IT area, PFS was significantly prolonged (p=0.057), but OS was not (p=0.324). The gene sets with relatively higher RNA expression in the good response group, were as follows; hematopoietic cell dedifferentiation gene, T-cell related adaptive immunity gene, interferon-related cytokine gene, and macrophage, NK, cell, T-cell innate immunity gene set. In the good response group, innate immune response (TLR7, PTPRC, CCL5), INF&#947; and JAK signaling molecules (CD8A, STAT1, CD86, IRF3, CXCL10, CXCL9, OAS1, IL10R &#945;, IRF1, IFNAR2, CXCR3, PYHIN1, KIRK1, IFIH1) showed more than 2-folds increase of RNA expression. Meanwhile, in the poor response group, inflammatory immune response (CTSV, HMGB3, KIT, CDC4EP4, TRIM28), extracellular immune response (SPON1, SRPX, SOX10, SNAI2, LING01, LAMC3), fibrosis response genes (TGF&#946;2, TGF&#946;1) was increased.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that the distinguishing spatial distribution of T-cells, macrophages and NK cells and RNA signature of immune-related genes have close associations with therapeutic outcomes in malignant melanoma patients treated with ICIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0038761-f64a-4684-b221-d30a1fcac5ab\/@x03B8ZXA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Microenvironment,Malignant melanoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"95d58f73-7c7c-4f3e-a50f-dc98ac09cffa","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95d58f73-7c7c-4f3e-a50f-dc98ac09cffa\/@x03B8ZXA\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seoree Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Su In Jo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang-Yeob Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Jun Bae<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong-Oh Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong-yeon Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joo-re Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cookjin Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang hoon Chun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gyeongsin Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Hyoung Kang<\/i><\/presenter>.

They comprise of primary (de novo) AS and secondary AS. The etiology of primary AS is unknown. Secondary AS arise due to DNA damaging factors like prior radiotherapy (RT), ultraviolet (UV) light exposure or chronic lymphedema (Stewart Treves syndrome). Treatment options are limited and their prognosis is poor. Development of new treatment strategies is difficult due to the rarity of these subgroups of STS. Genomic profiling of primary and secondary AS may provide a rationale for targeted treatment strategies.<br \/>Method: Tumor samples were retrospectively collected from patients diagnosed with AS in the Netherlands. Patients were categorized as primary\/secondary AS. Genomic profiles were analyzed using &#8220;TruSight Oncology 500&#8221;, a Next Generation Sequencing panel that analyzes variants in 523 cancer relevant genes.<br \/>Results: Tumor DNA from 51 treatment naive AS patients was analyzed. The cohort comprised of 26 patients with a primary AS, divided in 5 subgroups: Heart (n=5, 10%), primary breast (n=5, 10%), skin not UV associated (n=4, 8%), soft tissue (n=5, 10%) and visceral (n=7, 14%) AS. The other 25 patients had a secondary AS, subdivided in RT-associated (n=13, 25%), Stewart Treves (n=5, 10%) and UV-associated (n=7, 14%) AS. Mean Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) was 7.1 mutations per Mb for all patients (4.2 mut\/Mb in primary AS vs 10.1 in secondary AS, <i>p = 0.91<\/i>). High TMB (&#8805;10 mut\/Mb) was found in 6 patients (12%) divided over 3 subgroups: UV associated AS (n=3\/7 (43%)), visceral AS (n=2\/7 (28%)) and skin not UV associated AS (n=1\/4 (25%)). No patients were microsatellite instable. A pathogenic mutation, amplification or deletion was identified in 82% of all patients (n=42, 70% of primary AS vs 100% of secondary AS (<i>p<\/i>=&#60;0.01)). In 36 patients (71%) at least one (likely) pathogenic mutation was detected (54% primary vs 88% secondary AS, (<i>p<\/i>=0,013)). In 20 patients (39%) a mutation in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway was detected (12% primary vs 68% secondary AS (<i>p<\/i>=&#60;0.01)). The most frequently found mutations were <i>TP53 <\/i>(10%), <i>BRAF <\/i>(6%), <i>ERCC4<\/i> (6%), <i>PTPRD<\/i> (6%), <i>WETD2<\/i> (6%), <i>SETD2 <\/i>(6%) and <i>PIK3CA (4%)<\/i>. Amplifications were found in 49% (n=25) of all patients (15% primary vs 84% secondary AS, (<i>p<\/i>=&#60;0,01)). <i>MYC<\/i> amplifications were detected in 41% of all patients (15% of primary vs 68% of secondary AS), including 100% of Stewart Treves AS, 92% of RT associated AS and 75% of skin not UV associated AS. <i>FLT4<\/i> (20%) and <i>CRKL<\/i> (12%) amplifications occurred only in secondary AS. <i>FLT4<\/i> was seen in 31% of RT-associated AS.<br \/>Conclusion: We showed a clear distinction in genomic profiles of AS subgroups with specific pathogenic alterations. Especially secondary AS may benefit from treatment with ICI based on frequent MYC amplifications, DDR mutations, and high TMB. These data show clear evidence for the development of future treatment strategies with targeted therapy and ICI for this rare heterogeneous group of STS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/505334c0-245c-40e3-9465-57fdef327686\/@x03B8ZXA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Genomics,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stefan G.
