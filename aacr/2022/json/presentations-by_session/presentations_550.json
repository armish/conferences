[{"Abstract":"<b>Purpose:<\/b><i> <\/i>We examined disparities among female cancer survivors in associations between race\/ethnicity, United Statues (US) nativity, and odds of meeting the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) weekly exercise recommendations for adult cancer survivors, determining if different by comorbidity and obesity status.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><i> <\/i>We analyzed 2,044 adult females with a history of cancer 2+ years since initial cancer diagnosis from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2018). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression for associations between race\/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white [NHW], non-Hispanic Black [NHB], Hispanic\/Mexican American, additional racial\/ethnic groups), US nativity (US-born, foreign-born), and time of acculturation (US-born, foreign-born &#60;15 years in US, foreign-born &#8805;15 years in US) and odds of meeting weekly exercise recommendations accounting for examination weights and covariates. Statistical interactions between stratifications (comorbidity status [none, at least one]; BMI [underweight\/normal, overweight\/obese]) were conducted.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><i> <\/i>Most were breast cancer survivors (33.8%), NHW (64.1%), born in the US (84.5%), overweight\/obese (69.9%), and did not meet recommendations (66.5%). NHB survivors were significantly less likely to meet recommendations (aOR, 0.66, 95% CI, 0.47-0.92) than NHW survivors. Foreign-born women were 3.41 times more likely to meet recommendations (95% CI, 1.18-9.85) compared to US-born women. Survivors who were foreign-born and lived in the US for &#8805;15 years were significantly less likely to meet recommendations (aOR, 0.43, 95% CI, 0.21-0.87) compared to US natives. Comorbidity status significantly modified (<i>p<\/i>-interaction&#60; 0.05) the associations between US nativity and time of acculturation and BMI modified the relationship between race\/ethnicity and odds of meeting recommendations (<i>p<\/i>-interaction=0.013). NHB survivors who were underweight\/normal weight were 2 times more likely (95% CI, 0.96-4.77) to meet recommendations while overweight\/obese NHB survivors were significantly less likely (aOR, 0.27; 95% CI 0.13-0.56).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study results confirm that racial\/ethnic disparities exist in meeting exercise recommendations among NHB survivors, particularly those overweight\/obese. Our findings provide new evidence for disparities in meeting exercise recommendations among female cancer survivors born outside of the US. While foreign-born survivors were more likely to meet recommendations, living in the US for 15+ years was significantly associated with reduced odds of meeting recommendations. Results can inform researchers and clinicians to better tailor lifestyle and exercise interventions for these women to identify barriers for improving adherence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/83b2cab3-942a-4730-91a5-1ffc986177df\/@B03B8ZTa\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-03 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Exercise,US nativity,Race\/ethnic disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17924"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kate E.

The colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among Latinos is 54.8% and AI\/AN is 35%, compared to the overall Arizona screening rate of 62.6%, potentially contributing to higher CRC mortality rates in these groups.<br \/>Objective: Utilizing an inflatable colon to measuring CRC knowledge and intent to screen among Arizona&#8217;s diverse populations by administering a pre\/post test.<br \/>Methods: An inflatable colon with signs in both English and Spanish describes the progression of CRC. Spanish-speaking health educators and culturally tailored flip charts geared toward the AI\/AN population are utilized at community events throughout Arizona. Survey distribution measured pre- and post-CRC knowledge and intent to screen following a walking tour of the inflatable colon. Additional efforts include the production of a virtual tour of the giant colon in English and Spanish as an educational tool easily accessible on the UArizona Cancer Center YouTube page.<br \/>Results: Convenience sampling is utilized, and participants are recruited at outreach events where the inflatable colon is set up (n=15). Preliminary findings show that individuals increased their knowledge about CRC (76.9% vs 100%), understanding the pathology of CRC (i.e., colon polyp, normal colon tissue vs. cancerous tissue, etc.) (53.8% vs 100%), and CRC screening recommendations (30.8% vs 91.7%).<br \/>Conclusions: Colorectal cancer education is reaching diverse populations in Arizona. CRC education is delivered in both English and Spanish, and additional CRC educational tools such as the culturally tailored colon health flipbook for AI\/AN population are utilize. The use of the inflatable colon has increased CRC knowledge, CRC pathology, and CRC screening options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b2128c25-fcb8-40cc-9b38-80b48e6d31cd\/@B03B8ZTa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-01 Behavioral science and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Colon cancer,Cancer education,Community Outreach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18851"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Desiree Jones<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriela Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Contreras II<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rene D.

Addressing unmet SDoH needs may reduce interruptions to cancer care caused by ED visits and hospitalizations (EDH). We aimed to determine feasibility of systematic patient-reported SDoH collection at a large academic cancer center and association of unmet SDoH needs with EDH.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of SDoH needs among new oncology patient (pt) consults from 5\/15-9\/21at Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DCFI). Pts completed an intake questionnaire including demographic, disease, as well as SDOH needs on a dichotomous or 5-point Likert scale, specifically health literacy (&#8220;how confident are you in filling out medical forms?&#8221;), health numeracy (&#8220;how confident are you in understanding medical statistics?&#8221;) , financial distress (&#8220;how difficult is it for you, or your family, to meet monthly payments on your\/your family&#8217;s bills?&#8221;) and social isolation (&#8220;do you currently live alone?&#8221;). We ran bivariate and multivariable models on the association between demographics, SDoH and EDH within 30 days of initial oncology visit using robust generalized estimating equations controlling for clustering by consult provider. RESULTS: 125,997new consults were seen from 05\/15-09\/\/21, of which 20,913 completed the intake questionnaire and were alive at 30 days of consult. Of those pts, most were female (60%), aged 40-64 (50%), White (90%), non-Hispanic (84%), primarily English-speaking (9%) and 7% had an EDH within 30 days of their 1st outpatient visit. The most reported SDOH need was limited health numeracy (26%). In bivariate analysis, factors associated with ED visits included: limited English proficiency lung or GU\/GYN cancer, living &#62; 25 mi.from DFCI, and limited health literacy and numeracy (all p&#60;0.05). Demographics associated with hospitalizations included: White race and English as primary language (EPL) (both p&#60;0.05). Multivariable analysis showed female gender (OR 1.53, p &#60; 0.01), lung (OR 3.22*) and GU\/GYN (OR 2.21*) (p &#60; 0.05 for both) cancer, and living &#62; 25 mi from DFCI (OR 2.50, p &#60; 0.0001) were associated with increased likelihood of ED visit while EPL (OR 1.80, p&#60;0.05) and GU\/GYN (OR 1.65, p&#60;0.01*) cancer were associated with increased likelihood of hospitalization.CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to systematically screen for unmet SDoH which are associated with increased frequency of ED visits. Differences in characteristics associated with ED vs. hospitalization could indicate possible bias or suggest SDoH needs as a reason for avoidance of costly medical care. Further study will expand both the content and site of SDoH data collection, non-English languages used for data collection, and measure impact of resource matching to reduce disruptions to cancer care.<br \/>*Compared to breast cancer","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f47e12c3-8173-4bb2-97fa-39149a5a0224\/@C03B8ZTb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-01 Behavioral science and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prevention,Social determinants of health,Implementation science,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18852"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"313489b7-e529-4fbf-a179-e213cadb2e86","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/313489b7-e529-4fbf-a179-e213cadb2e86\/@C03B8ZTb\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ashley Odai-Afotey<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ellana Haakenstad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunyi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bridget A.

However, whether obesity impacts sexual functioning (SF) in GynCa patients has been understudied. Limited studies have used body mass index (BMI) as the only obesity indicator, which may result in a misunderstanding of the effect of obesity on SF in GynCa patients with different body compositions. This study aimed to explore the role of obesity via two different measures in determining SF in GynCa patients pre-and post-radiotherapy (RT).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this secondary analysis, obesity was measured pre-RT by both BMI and body fat percentage (BFP). BFP was calculated by using the Clinica Universidad de Navarra-Body Adiposity Estimator. SF, physical and emotional well-being were assessed pre-RT by the Female Sexual Function Index and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. At 6 months post-RT, SF was reassessed. Generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with a log-link were implemented to identify the effect of obesity (using BMI and BFP) on SF pre-and post-RT. Regression-based mediation analysis was used to identify mediating effects of physical and emotional well-being between obesity and SF.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among 54 (24 cervical and 30 endometrial) patients, 48% were Black, 52% were married or in a domestic partnership, and 59% were treated with surgery and\/or chemotherapy pre-RT (i.e. prior treatment). Less patients were classified as being obese when obesity was measured by BMI (48%) compared to BFP (61%). Patients with endometrial cancer and prior treatment history were more likely to be obese and reported better SF. Unadjusted GLM showed that patients with obesity had better SF than those without obesity pre-RT regardless of obesity measures (BMI <i>p <\/i>= .018; BFP <i>p <\/i>= .016). However, we found no association between obesity (both BMI-and BFP-based obesity) and SF pre-RT after adjusting for cancer type and prior treatment history. GLMM showed that BFP-based obesity had a negative effect on the improvement in SF from pre-RT to post-RT (<i>p <\/i>= .013) after adjusting for cancer type and prior treatment history. Patients without BFP-based obesity showed a significant improvement post-RT (<i>p <\/i>= .019), but those with obesity (per BFP) showed no changes in SF post-RT (<i>p <\/i>= .949) compared to pre-RT. BMI-based obesity did not affect the changes in SF post-RT. We found no mediation effects of physical and emotional well-being between obesity and SF.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Obesity may play a negative role in SF improvement in GynCa patients post-RT. More rigorous research and clinical attention to obesity measurement are necessary to determine the association between obesity and SF in GynCa patients and thus lead to the discovery of new interventions for this long-neglected topic of SF in GynCa patients, particularly for those who are obese.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/91442a7a-1324-48bb-9430-64905694bc2f\/@C03B8ZTb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-07 Quality of life\/late effects\/survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Gynecological cancers,Obesity,Sexual function,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18853"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"9a0c4588-ca16-452f-90a9-1eda8d305e42","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9a0c4588-ca16-452f-90a9-1eda8d305e42\/@C03B8ZTb\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haerim Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deborah W.

In spite of rapid technological progress being made in genomics, a 'genomic divide' is emerging between developed and developing countries. This is partly because of the limited genomic literacy of healthcare professionals and a scarcity of available genomics workforce that reportedly deters them from proposing genomic testing. We aim to help reduce this 'genomic divide' by proposing a genomic test report design for clinicians in Pakistan, that incorporates user-centered design principles. We tested two commonly used genomic reportswiththat varied in language, content and layout. Report A was a one-page genomic report from the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, of a patient with suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Report B was a report from FoundationOneCDx, of a breast carcinoma specimen with confirmed findings mentioned. We employed a qualitative descriptive study design, including a survey for trainees, non-specialists, and specialists. The parameters recorded were: subject comprehension, overall visual impression, level of difficulty of the language, and ease of understanding, along with, actionability and degree of trust. A total of 49 medical professionals across 11 institutes in Pakistan participated in the survey, of which 11 were specialists and 38 were non-specialists. We extracted 19 recommendations from the survey and broadly grouped them into three categories: communication style, report content, and layout. About 25% of the respondents commented that they would prefer a short and concise report, 20.8% wanted the language to be &#8216;doctor-friendly&#8217; and 8.3% preferred data to be presented in tables. All recommendations were incorporated into our proposed genomic test report template. The template displays the results and what they mean for the patient (in layman's terms for ease of access to non-specialists), what possible action is to be taken by the doctor, and details of further information and support regarding the results. We propose the addition of a box on technical methodology at the end of the report template that may help in assisting with refreshing the genomic knowledge of non-specialists. Our findings have shown that in order to design impactful genomic reports for clinicians in Pakistan, we will have to start with a user-centered design approach. This can be instrumental in helping us improve the adoption of genomic testing in clinics around Pakistan. <b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/67daecf5-c201-4106-bfbd-c3dc3db2b470\/@C03B8ZTb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-04 Genetic testing and counseling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Genomic testing,Genomic Literacy,Genomic Reports,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21201"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"6ca4c7ce-3c28-4424-8658-ae21cae4b502","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6ca4c7ce-3c28-4424-8658-ae21cae4b502\/@C03B8ZTb\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Momal Agha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faisal Khan<\/i><\/presenter>.
