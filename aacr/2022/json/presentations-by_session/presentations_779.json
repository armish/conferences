[{"Abstract":"<b><u>Background<\/u><\/b>: Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting Programmed Death-1\/Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-1\/PD-L1) alone or in combination with chemotherapy is now a first-line option for patients with advanced NSCLC, the majority of patients do not benefit from anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 monotherapy, and the combination with chemotherapy is often associated with toxicity. For patients who initially respond to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibition, many relapse after an initial response and are in need for innovative strategies to overcome the resistance to ICB. One possible approach is to utilize <i>in situ<\/i> vaccination with functional chemokine gene-modified antigen presenting cells (APCs) that take advantage of the full repertoire of tumor antigens in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in order to restore tumor antigen presentation, promote tumor infiltration of immune cells driven by chemokine gradient, and facilitate tumor-specific T cell activation, both locally and systemically. The chemokine CCL21 is a therapeutic candidate due to its ability to promote infiltration and co-localization of na&#239;ve T cells and antigen-experienced dendritic cells (DCs) and facilitate T cell activation. In preclinical studies as well as a phase I clinical trial, we observed that intratumoral (IT) injection of CCL21-DC induces the infiltration of autologous DC and T cells into the TME, and generates systemic tumor-specific immune responses against multiple tumor antigens. We also observed tumoral PD-L1 upregulation following CCL21-DC injection, which may hinder T cell function. Similarly, the lack of efficacy of PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors could potentially be combated by enhanced T cell infiltration and augmented APC function in the TME following <i>in situ <\/i>vaccination with CCL21-DC.<b> <\/b>Therefore, we are currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of combining IT CCL21-DC and intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab in advanced NSCLC patients following progression on ICB or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in a phase I trial (NCT03546361).<br \/><b><u>Methods<\/u><\/b><b>: <\/b>Phase I, dose-escalating, multi-cohort trial followed by dose expansion. Maximum of 24 patients (9-12 escalation + 12 expansion) with stage IV NSCLC will be evaluated who have tumors accessible for IT injection and are either EGFR\/ALK wild-type after progression on a PD-(L)1 inhibitor or EGFR\/ALK mutant after progression on TKI. Three IT injections of autologous CCL21-DC (days 0, 21, 42) will be concurrently administered with pembrolizumab, followed by q3wk pembrolizumab up to 1 year. Primary objective of dose escalation is safety and determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IT CCL21-DC when combined with pembrolizumab. Primary objective of dose expansion is objective response rate at MTD. Secondary objectives include adverse event profiling and immune monitoring studies.<br \/>[B.L. and A.L. contributed equally to this work as first authors.]","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd8545ab-a509-4525-932a-c231666469ea\/@v03B8ZYD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Dendritic cells,PD-1,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20631"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bin Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Lisberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramin Salehi-Rad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linh M.

The most commonly reported PARPi resistance mechanisms are (1) reversal of HRR deficiency through (a) reversion mutations in <i>BRCA<\/i> or other HRR genes (eg, <i>RAD51C\/D<\/i>) or (b) DNA end resection rewiring with loss of 53BP1, REV7, or Shieldin complex components; or (2) stabilization of stalled replication forks through loss of PTIP or EZH2, preventing nuclease recruitment. The only confirmed PARPi resistance mechanism in the clinic to date is reversion mutations.<br \/>Combined ATR and PARP inhibition is an attractive strategy that may overcome PARPi resistance, as has been shown in PARPi-resistant cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models (Yazinski et al <i>Genes Dev<\/i> 2017; Murai et al <i>Oncotarget <\/i>2016; Kim et al <i>Nat Commun<\/i> 2020; data on file, AstraZeneca). The PARPi olaparib 300 mg twice daily (BID) continuously in combination with the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib 160 mg daily on days 1-7 of a 28-day cycle has demonstrated promising activity in the CAPRI study in patients with ovarian cancer who had progressed on PARPis (Wethington et al <i>J Clin Oncol<\/i> 2021). However, preclinical models of PARPi resistance suggest that a higher dose or duration of ceralasertib with a lower dose of olaparib may be more beneficial (data on file, AstraZeneca).<br \/>Methods: D5330C00004 (NCT02264678) is a multicenter, modular, phase 1 study assessing ceralasertib in combination with other anti-cancer agents in adults with advanced solid malignancies. In Module 2, a lower dose of olaparib (150 mg BID continuous) and a longer duration of ceralasertib (80 mg BID, days 1-14 of a 28-day cycle) is now being explored in 2 expansion cohorts in patients with platinum-sensitive, high-grade, serous or endometrioid ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic <i>BRCA<\/i> or <i>RAD51C\/D<\/i> mutations, or HRR deficiency by Myriad MyChoice<sup>&#174;<\/sup> or FoundationOne<sup>&#174;<\/sup> CDx (F1CDx) assays. Patients will have progressed on prior PARPis after &#8805;6 months in the maintenance or treatment setting (&#8805;12 months after first-line maintenance). Cohort 1 is enrolling ~30 patients immediately after progression on a PARPi; Cohort 2 is recruiting ~30 PARPi-treated patients after intervening platinum-based chemotherapy. Study endpoints include safety, tumor response by RECIST 1.1, and duration of response. Exploratory analyses include genomic and functional analysis of HRR restoration in tumor and circulating tumor DNA, and analysis of replication fork stability in organoid<br \/>cultures established from mandatory fresh tumor biopsy samples. Recruitment began in July 2021 with the first patient dosed in August 2021.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f3c55271-1336-44b2-96a0-1fd32d318c90\/@v03B8ZYD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian,ATR,PARP inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20297"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Geoffrey I.

While KRAS G12C inhibitors have demonstrated activity in pts, overall efficacy may be limited by incomplete target occupancy. LY3537982 is a novel, orally bioavailable, highly selective, and potent inhibitor of the KRAS G12C protein with the potential to deliver &#62;90% target occupancy in pts. In preclinical studies, LY3537982 demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition <i>in vivo <\/i>as a single agent in a KRAS G12C NSCLC PDX model, and robust tumor regression in combination with other agents <i>in vivo <\/i>in a KRAS G12C sensitive NSCLC model.<sup>1<\/sup><br \/>Methods: LOXO-RAS-20001 is an open-label, multi-center, first-in-human Phase 1 study of oral LY3537982 in pts with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced solid tumors. This study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1a dose escalation to evaluate LY3537982 monotherapy and Phase 1b dose expansion to evaluate both LY3537982 monotherapy and in combination. Dose escalation will follow a modified toxicity probability interval-2 (mTPI-2) method, allowing for backfill to previously cleared dose levels that demonstrate therapeutically relevant exposures or direct evidence of clinical activity. DLT evaluation period will be 21 days. The primary objective of Phase 1a is to determine the LY3537982 recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 1b will enroll pts into dose expansion cohorts based on tumor type (NSCLC, CRC, other solid tumors) and prior treatment including KRAS G12C inhibitor refractory NSCLC. Key objectives of Phase 1b are to determine the safety and tolerability of LY3537982 monotherapy, and in combination with various agents: abemaciclib, erlotinib, cetuximab, an investigational ERK inhibitor (LY3214996), an investigational Aurora A kinase inhibitor (LY3295668), and an anti-PD1 antibody. Key secondary objectives include determining the pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of LY3537982 based on overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to response (TTR), and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1. Eligible pts must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, have a <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C mutation in tumor tissue or ctDNA, have locally advanced, unresectable and\/or metastatic cancer per disease specific criteria, and be appropriate candidates for experimental therapy or refused available therapy. Additionally, pts must be &#8805;18 years old, have ECOG PS of 0-1, and have adequate organ function.

The G12C inhibitor (G12Ci) sotorasib has recently received FDA approval for patients with KRAS G12C mt NSCLC, however emerging data suggest that combinations may be necessary for maximal depth and duration of response. Unlike MEK-only inhibitors (MEKi), the dual RAF\/MEK inhibitor VS-6766 is a potent allosteric inhibitor of MEK kinase activity and promotes a dominant negative RAF\/MEK complex preventing phosphorylation of MEK by BRAF and CRAF. Thus, VS-6766 blocks MEK signaling without compensatory activation of MEK which limits the efficacy of MEKi. In vitro 3D proliferation and in vivo tumor models were used to assess anti-tumor efficacy of VS-6766 &#177; G12Ci. In KRAS G12C mt NSCLC cell lines, VS-6766 was synergistic with both sotorasib and adagrasib (G12Ci) in reducing tumor cell viability which correlated with deeper inhibition of RAS pathway signaling. In vivo, combination of VS-6766 with sotorasib induced strong tumor regressions in contrast to sotorasib monotherapy or sotorasib plus trametinib. Initial clinical activity of VS-6766 in KRAS G12C mt NSCLC is supported by the FRAME study [NCT03875820] results in which 4\/6 patients with KRAS G12C mt NSCLC showed tumor reduction including 1 PR. These results support the clinical evaluation of VS-6766 in combination with a G12Ci for treatment of KRAS G12C mt NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: This is a Phase 1\/2, multicenter, open label, dose evaluation\/dose expansion study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VS-6766 in combination with sotorasib in patients with KRAS G12C mt NSCLC who have not previously been treated with a KRAS G12Ci or have experienced disease progression while undergoing therapy with a KRAS G12Ci [NCT05074810]. The study will be conducted in two parts: Part A (dose evaluation) and Part B (dose expansion). Up to 3 dose levels will be evaluated in Part A to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for Part B. Part B will assess the efficacy of the RP2D and will be conducted in 2 cohorts: patients who are G12Ci treatment na&#239;ve (cohort 1) and patients who have experienced disease progress during G12Ci therapy (Cohort 2). Patients enrolled must have histologic or cytologic evidence of NSCLC, measurable disease according to RECIST V1.1 and known KRAS G12C mutation. The study will enroll up to 121 patients with a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 patients (dose levels 1 and -1 have &#62;1 DLT in first 3 patients or dose levels 1 and 2 each enroll 6 patients) in Part A and an additional 109 patients in Part B (minimum of 41 patients RP2D stage 1 for cohort 1 and 2 or RP2D stages 1 and 2 in both cohorts).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7859a495-00e2-4057-b135-a4a1630df67b\/@v03B8ZYD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,KRAS,RAF kinase,MEK inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20300"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ramaswamy Govindan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan A.

Recurrence after surgery is close to 100%, even with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Our collaborators have performed deep immunophenotyping of treatment-na&#239;ve MPM lesions using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to define the tumor microenvironment. A population of rare CD141+ dendritic cells (DC1) is disproportionately represented in some MPM lesions analyzed. These DC1 cells&#8212; which express high levels of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)&#8212; are among the most potent cross-presenters of antigen and are key to priming anti-tumor CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC), is a double-stranded RNA host-targeted therapeutic viral-mimic. Poly-ICLC activates multiple innate immune receptors including TLR3 and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), leading to cross-presentation of antigen to T cells and induction of strong Th1 response. We hypothesize that injection of poly-ICLC prior to surgical resection may activate intratumoral (IT) DC1s, increase tumor antigen presentation to cytotoxic T cells, and induce tumor-specific immune surveillance.<br \/>Methods: This is a phase I\/Ib study to evaluate the safety of IT poly-ICLC prior to surgical resection for patients with MPM (NCT04525859). The primary endpoint is safety as assessed by frequency and severity of toxicities by CTCAE 5.0. Secondary endpoints are objective response as measured by RECIST 1.1 and recurrence free survival measured from the time of first poly-ICLC injection. Exploratory endpoints include evaluation of circulating immune cells (including regulatory T cells and NK cells), evaluation of immune cell infiltration in pre-injection tumor biopsy and surgically resected tissue, as well as characterization of immune parameters such as local B cell specificity. The protocol features a Simon&#8217;s two-stage design, with six patients enrolled in a phase I safety cohort, proceeding to a phase Ib expansion cohort (additional 13 patients) if no more than 1 dose limiting toxicity occurs. Eligible patients must have MPM deemed operable by the treating thoracic surgeon. Eligible subjects may not have uncontrolled immunocompromised states or autoimmune disorders. After enrollment, patients undergo biopsies at which time 2mg poly-ICLC is injected across two sites in the tumor. Patients then undergo resection of the tumor (pleurectomy\/decortication or extra pleural pneumonectomy per standard of care) at day 21+\/- 7 after poly-ICLC injection. Blood is drawn at three points (prior to poly-ICLC injection, at time of surgery, and at a post-operative visit) for immune profiling. At the time of submission six patients have been treated and phase Ib accrual is continuing as planned. Interim analysis of phase I safety and exploratory endpoints will be reported in late 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/452c1794-e6b5-4446-b677-74cf406d727f\/@w03B8ZYE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cancer vaccine,Surgical resection,Dendritic cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20301"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c6343dd9-9bc9-4654-8aa3-d88aa21116ec","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c6343dd9-9bc9-4654-8aa3-d88aa21116ec\/@w03B8ZYE\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bailey G.

EVT801 has shown compelling single agent efficacy in multiple <i>in vivo<\/i> models. In addition, combination of EVT801 and Immune Checkpoint Therapy (ICT) agents shows additive effects, and thus holds promise for combination treatment without induction of hypoxia-induced-immunosuppression. A phase I clinical trial is underway.<br \/>Methods: The phase I trial will consist of two sequential stages. During the first stage, EVT801 will be administered to patients with advanced solid tumors in a multiple ascending dose study using an accelerated 3+3 design (1 patient per dose until grade 2 toxicities are observed) in up to 48 patients in 8 dose levels. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Stage 2 will focus on validation of this RP2D in two 6-patient cohorts diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or renal cell carcinoma. These patients will participate in intensive analyses involving several biomarkers to better understand the pharmacological activity of the drug. A potential third stage, consisting of a multiple ascending dose evaluation of the combination of EVT801 with immuno-oncology drugs, may be added to the ongoing trial, pending further technical discussions with physicians and regulators. In addition to conventional measures of safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics, the phase I study will employ a rich suite of histological, immunological, and radiological biomarkers to provide early insights into the activity of EVT801.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c1a98027-22ab-47f3-9c8c-ea73a27981de\/@w03B8ZYE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antiangiogenic therapy,Kinase inhibitors,Biomarkers,Lymphangiogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20302"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Carlos Gomez roca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Cassier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Mandron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myriam Estrabaut<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathalie Delesque-Touchard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam C.

CB307 is a tri-specific Humabody targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA\/FOLH1), CD137 (4-1BB\/TNFSF9) and human serum albumin (HSA). Unlike CD3 targeting bispecific compounds, stimulation of CD137 on T cells can promote T cell cytotoxicity, proliferation, survival and memory T cell formation without compromising safety, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS). In addition, HSA binding assists CB307 penetration into the tumor since albumin is enriched in the tumor microenvironment. Several cancers including prostate cancer and lung cancer are known to have PSMA expression. The objectives of the POTENTIA study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of CB307 and to assess preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with PSMA+ solid tumor.<br \/>Methods: The phase 1 study consists of dose escalation (part 1) and cohort expansion (part 2) components, and the study is currently enrolling patients in part 1 without dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The dose escalation uses an accelerated titration design (ATD) and a modified continual reassessment method (mCRM) to guide the MTD and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The key inclusion criteria are as follows: histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic PSMA expressing solid tumors determined by immunohistochemistry; not amenable to standard-of-care; RECIST measurable disease or increased serum PSA at baseline (for bone metastasis-only prostate cancer). The key exclusion criteria are patients with brain metastases; patients who have discontinued previous immunotherapy due to intolerable immune-related adverse events; patients with acute infections or autoimmune diseases. Cohort expansion uses the same eligibility criteria, however, at least 3 patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer harboring either <i>BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM<\/i> and\/or<i> CDK12<\/i> mutation(s) will be enrolled. CB307 is administered intravenously every week. PSMA-PET scan and tumor biopsy are taken to understand the mechanism of action of CB307 as well as a change of PSMA expression during CB307 treatment.

Identifying strategies to improve survival is imperative. Ovarian cancer survivors with higher quality of life (QoL) have better prognosis based on results from GOG-0218. Life purpose, defined as the meaning or direction a person has in life, emerged as an important theme in recent focus groups conducted among women who have lived five or more years with ovarian cancer. The participants felt that strong life purpose is a major contributor to their exceptional survival. Further, among people without cancer, strong life purpose has been shown to lead to improved QoL and longer survival. The Purposeful eHealth application (app) has been developed to improve life purpose. Preliminary data from non-cancer patients suggest that use of the app leads to increased life purpose. We hypothesized that among ovarian cancer survivors, greater life purpose is associated with higher QoL scores, and we initiated a clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of ovarian cancer patients using the Purposeful app. Secondary outcomes include evaluation of whether use of this eHealth app improves life purpose and QoL. The app has potential as an accessible hands-on support system for ovarian cancer survivors to increase life purpose, QoL, and potentially survival if positive results are observed from the trial.<br \/>Methods: In this single-arm interventional study (NCT04458168), eligible patients are age 18 or older, have ovarian cancer, and are under treatment through the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center Gynecologic Oncology clinic. As of January 2022, we have enrolled 45 women. We innovatively designed the study to enroll 25 women in each of three groups based on disease status to identify an optimal intervention period: Group 1: just completed treatment, Group 2: have not experienced a recurrence after one year since the initial diagnosis, Group 3: have experienced a recurrence after primary treatment. After providing informed consent, participants are provided with the Purposeful app and asked to fill out seven questionnaires in-person or remotely: 1) Demographics; 2) Life Purpose; 3) QoL; 4) Well-Being; 5) Fatigue; 6) Meaning in Life; and 7) Self-Care Assessment and Integrative Medicine Use. Participants&#8217; CA125 measures and disease status are also collected from medical records. Participants are followed up at months 1, 3, and 6; at each visit, participants complete questionnaires 2-7 and the Acceptability questionnaire. Participants are asked to use the app daily until the end of 6 months. At the end of the study, overall and group-specific feasibility and acceptability will be assessed. Additionally, we will examine the associations between app usage, life purpose, and QoL through generalized linear\/additive mixed models.<br \/><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f2930a01-fe33-476a-9c7b-37903458f792\/@w03B8ZYE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Quality of life,Epidemiology,Life purpose,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20304"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aliya Alimujiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhramar Mukherjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maureen Metzger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>R.

However, most patients with advanced solid tumors do not derive benefits, or relapse after T-cell checkpoint blockade. Myeloid checkpoint inhibition is a new approach to cancer immunotherapy. LILRB2 is primarily expressed by myeloid cells and its expression in tumors is associated with high macrophage infiltration. Several LILRB2 ligands (HLA-G, ANGPTL2, and SEMA4A) are known to contribute to the immune suppressive microenvironment of solid tumors. Blockade of the LILRB2 pathway has the potential to reactivate or enhance anti-tumor T cell immune responses. IO-108 is a IgG4 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds LILRB2 to block ligands interaction and activation of LILRB2. In vitro, IO-108 treatment of primary immune cells results increased pro&#8209;inflammatory responses and an enhanced antigen presenting cell phenotypes. A Good Laboratory Practice repeat-dose, 15-day toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys at 0 (control), 1, 10, or 100 mg\/kg\/dose administered intravenously once weekly for a total of 3 doses showed that IO-108 was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with only non-statistically significant reduction of thyroid glands weight. No-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of 100 mg\/kg provides a sufficient safety margin for the IO-108 starting dose of 60 mg, which was derived using a MABEL (minimum anticipated biological effect level) approach. This clinical trial is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic evaluation of intravenously administered IO-108, both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, in adult patients with solid tumors that have failed standard of care therapies (NCT05054348). It is estimated that up to 36 patients will be enrolled in the study. IO-108 will be administered every 21 days, with a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period of 21 days. Patients will be enrolled into sequential cohorts and treated with increasing doses of IO-108 using mTPI (modified Toxicity Probability Interval) method. Safety, PK, and clinical activity will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. The primary objective of the study is to assess safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels of IO-108 in successive cohorts of adult patients (treated with or without with pembrolizumab) with advanced relapsed or refractory solid tumors, to estimate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and select the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives include characterizing PK, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity. Biomarker evaluation will include changes in myeloid cell markers and T-cells, LILRB2 expression level and receptor occupancy. Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive in nature. Tabulations will be produced for appropriate disposition, demographic, baseline disease characteristics, safety, PK, pharmacodynamic, and clinical activity parameters. Response to treatment as assessed by RECIST v1.1 will be tabulated. To date, five patients have been dosed without DLT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ba9bf98-f30a-40cc-babc-9848804bedf6\/@w03B8ZYE\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Phase I,Myeloid Checkpoint,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20305"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>John Powderly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manish Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Woodard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Luke Chung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyu Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Wieland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyu Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Jose Costa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>X.

Inhibition of menin is a novel approach to cancer treatment. Preclinical data of BMF-219, a highly selective, orally bioavailable small-molecule irreversible inhibitor of menin, show sustained potent abrogation of menin-dependent oncogenic signaling in vitro and in vivo. BMF-219 demonstrated a strong anti-proliferative effect on various menin-dependent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, DLBCL lines representing Double\/Triple Hit Lymphoma (DHL\/THL), Double Expressor Lymphoma (DEL), and MM cell lines harboring diverse mutational backgrounds. BMF-219 also exhibited high potency <i>ex vivo<\/i> in patient samples from MLL-rearranged and NPM1-mutant AML, THL and MYC-amplified DLBCL, and bone marrow mononuclear cells from treatment-naive and R\/R MM.<br \/>Methods: BF-MNN-101 (NCT05153330) is a prospective, open-label, multi-cohort, non-randomized, multicenter Phase I study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of escalating doses of oral BMF-219 administered once daily in patients with R\/R AL, DLBCL and MM who have received standard therapy. Utilizing an accelerated titration design, doses of BMF-219 will be escalated in single-subject cohorts independently for each indication following a modified Fibonacci sequence until 1 subject experiences either a &#8805; Grade 2 adverse event or dose limiting toxicity (DLT). At that point, the current and all subsequent dose level(s) for the specific indication\/cohort will follow a classical &#8220;3 + 3&#8221; design. Each treatment cycle will be 28 days until progression or intolerability occurs. Following conclusion of the parallel dose-escalations, expansion cohorts for each indication will enroll patients to obtain further safety and efficacy data.<br \/>Eligible patients include those with R\/R AL, R\/R DLBLC &#8805; 2 but &#8804; 5 therapies, and R\/R MM who received &#8805; 3 therapies who failed or are ineligible for any standard therapies. Patients must have ECOG &#8804;2, and adequate organ function with prior treatment-related toxicities resolved to &#8804; Grade 2. Key exclusion criteria include known CNS disease involvement, prior menin inhibitor therapy, and clinically significant cardiovascular disease.<br \/>The primary objective is to determine independently for each cohort\/indication the optimal biological dose (OBD)\/ recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BMF-219 oral monotherapy. Key secondary objectives include further evaluation of safety and tolerability, characterization of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of BMF-219, and assessment of its antitumor activity based on best overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) per disease-specific response criteria as assessed by the investigator. Food-effect studies will be performed in DLBCL and MM patients at certain dose levels in the escalation phase and during the expansion cohort portion of the study.<br \/>The first patient in the study is anticipated to dose in Q1 of 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a1ad62db-52da-4eb2-b054-cf547a45c76e\/@w03B8ZYE\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias,Multiple myeloma,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20306"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Farhad Ravandi-Kashani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashwin Kishtagari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hetty Carraway<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Curran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gary Schiller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Cacovean<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhagyashree Yadav<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Butler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Lancet<\/i><\/presenter>.

There is an unmet need for effective targeted therapy against <i>HER2 <\/i>mutations in solid tumors, particularly in NSCLC. Historically, ex20ins mutations have responded poorly to TKIs. Moreover, EGFR-targeted agents that inhibit mutant HER2<i> <\/i>are associated with off-target wild type-related toxicities. Despite the promise of trastuzumab deruxtecan and other agents in this setting, the development of orally available selective TKIs is important given the heterogeneity of HER2 aberrations, potential for combinations regimens, and the risk of ILD with ADCs. BI 1810631 is a HER2 selective TKI that covalently binds to both wild-type and mutated HER2 receptors, including ex20ins, whilst sparing EGFR signaling; preclinical data suggest good tolerability and efficacy. This Phase Ia\/Ib, open-label, non-randomized study aims to determine the safety, MTD, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of BI 1810631 in pts with <i>HER2+<\/i> solid tumors (NCT04886804).<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>It is planned that ~96 pts from 3 sites in the US, Netherlands, and Japan will be recruited. In Phase Ia, consecutive cohorts of pts will receive BI 1810631 QD or BID at escalating doses. Starting dose level: 15 mg BID (~36 pts); QD schedule will begin after one dose level above estimated therapeutic dose of BI 1810631 is determined safe by the Dose Escalation Committee (expected starting dose: 60 mg [~30 pts]). BI 1810631 dose escalation will continue (guided by Bayesian Logistic Regression Model) until MTD and\/or RP2D for each schedule is determined, as well as a preferred Phase Ib schedule. In Phase Ib an initial 30 pts with <i>HER2 <\/i>ex20ins mutation-positive, pre-treated NSCLC will be enrolled, with possible inclusion of additional cohorts in the future. Overall pt inclusion criteria (Phase Ia): &#8805;18 years of age; histologically\/cytologically confirmed <i>HER2+ <\/i>(defined as overexpression, gene amplification, non-synonymous somatic mutation, or gene rearrangement involving <i>HER2 <\/i>or <i>NRG1) <\/i>advanced, unresectable and\/or metastatic solid tumors refractory\/not suitable for standard therapy; exhausted treatment options; measurable or evaluable lesions (according to RECIST v1.1); ECOG PS &#8804;1. Phase Ib criteria: <i>HER2 <\/i>ex20ins mutation-positive NSCLC; received &#8805;1 line of platinum-based combination chemotherapy in the advanced\/metastatic setting. Primary endpoints: MTD based on the number of DLTs\/number of pts with DLTs (Phase Ia); objective response (Phase Ib). Secondary endpoints: number of pts with DLTs throughout entire treatment period and PK parameters (Phase Ia\/Ib); duration of response, PFS, disease control, and duration of disease control (Phase Ib).

NG&#8209;350A is a novel T&#8209;SIGn (Tumor-Specific Immuno Gene) adenoviral vector that expresses a fully human agonistic IgG anti-CD40 antibody to promote innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, NG&#8209;350A selectively replicates in tumor cells, allowing IV dosing to be coupled with local transgene expression in the TME, thereby targeting all tumor lesions while limiting systemic exposure. Through these immunostimulatory effects the vector is designed to re-program &#8216;cold&#8217; TMEs to allow functional anti-cancer immune responses. Data from an ongoing study with IV NG-350A monotherapy have shown promising tolerability, as well as prominent and sustained elevations in inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IFN&#947;, IL-17A, IL-2 and IFN&#945;2) consistent with the mechanism of action of anti-CD40 in stimulating TME re-programming [Naing 2021]. Based on these promising initial data, we designed a study to further assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of NG-350A + pembrolizumab.<br \/>Methods: FORTIFY (NCT05165433) is an open-label, dose-escalating, phase 1a\/b study of NG&#8209;350A + pembrolizumab. Eligible patients have advanced\/metastatic epithelial tumors that have progressed after &#8805;1 line of systemic therapy and are incurable by local therapy. Patients eligible for phase 1a must have experienced failure of prior PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibition as part of any prior line of therapy; patients eligible for phase 1b must have primary resistance to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibition. During phase 1a, up to 30 patients will receive escalating doses of IV NG-350A (Bayesian Optimal Interval design) to a maximum of 1 &#215; 10<sup>12 <\/sup>viral particles (vp) on Day 1 and 1 &#215; 10<sup>13 <\/sup>vp on Days 3 and 5 (1 cycle). Patients will receive a fixed-dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg IV) on Day 15 and then every 3 weeks thereafter for up to 35 cycles. Phase 1b will further investigate the efficacy\/safety of the selected regimen in up to 3 tumor-specific cohorts using a Simon 2-stage design. Co&#8209;primary objectives are to characterize the safety and tolerability of NG-350A + pembrolizumab and to identify a recommended dose. Preliminary efficacy and immunogenicity are secondary endpoints. Pharmacodynamic outcomes will be assessed using tumor tissues and blood. Analyses of tumor tissue (serial biopsies at baseline and Day 15 of cycles 1-3 [cycles 1-2 only in Phase 1b]) will explore virus replication, transgene expression and immune\/inflammatory responses.

Adoptive immunotherapy with CD19 directed CAR-T cells is a standard option for B cell lymphoid malignancies in the relapsed setting. This study assesses the safety and preliminary efficacy of CD4 targeting autologous CAR-T, LB1901, in patients (pts) with CD4+ relapsed or refractory (R\/R) TCL. A pre-clinical study showed LB1901 exhibited potent anti-tumor activity without off-target effects (Zeng 2021).<br \/>Methods: This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, multicohort study of LB1901 (NCT04712864; currently enrolling). Eligible pts are &#8805;18 years with histologically confirmed CD4+ PTCL-NOS (not otherwise specified); or CD4+ AITL (angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma); or CD4+ CTCL (either MF [mycosis fungoides] or SS [S&#233;zary syndrome]). In Part A (dose escalation), pts with SS must have &#8804;2,000 circulating S&#233;zary cells\/&#181;L to ensure safety of pts with higher disease burden. In Part B, pts with &#62;2,000 S&#233;zary cells\/&#181;L is allowed. CD4 expressed on tumor cells must be confirmed within 3 months prior to apheresis. Other inclusion criteria include: R\/R disease with &#8805;2 prior lines of systemic antineoplastic therapy; for pts with PTCL-NOS or AITL, &#8805;1 measurable lesion according to IWG Response Criteria (Cheson 2014) and for pts with CTCL, &#8805;stage IIB on TNMB-ISLC\/EORTC staging system; identified HSCT donor available prior to enrollment (in the event of severe recurrent infections and prolonged lymphopenia for which pt may need an allogeneic HSCT as a safety rescue); and ECOG status of 0 or 1. Response will be evaluated based on IWG response criteria for PTCL and Global Composite Response for CTCL (Olsen 2007). The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part A: dose escalation and Part B: dose expansion). Three dose levels (0.3 X 10<sup>6<\/sup>, 1.0 X 10<sup>6<\/sup>, and 3.0 X 10<sup>6<\/sup> CAR+ viable T cells\/kg) will be evaluated (N=3-6 for each dose level) with an optional dose level minus 1 (0.1 X 10<sup>6<\/sup> CAR+ viable T cells\/kg). Part B will include 2 cohorts, PTCL and CTCL (N=12-20 for each), after the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) has been identified in Part A. Enrolled pts will undergo apheresis for PBMC collection. LB1901 will be manufactured from autologous CD8+ T cells. Pts may receive optional bridging therapy and receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine 30mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/day and cyclophosphamide 300mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/day (Flu-Cy), for 3 days followed by LB1901. Primary endpoints are incidence, duration, and severity of AEs and laboratory abnormalities (Parts A and B) and DLT at each dose level (Part A). Secondary endpoints include overall response rate; duration of response; CAR-positive T cell counts and CAR transgene level in blood; and presence of anti-CAR antibody response. Exploratory endpoints include preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and CD4+ T cell counts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4b67f715-9e6d-466a-b03e-1213feac90c0\/@x03B8ZYF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,CD4+ R\/R T-Cell Lymphoma,Immunotherapy,CD4-CAR-T,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20311"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Swaminathan P.

All preclinical models fall short in capturing this complexity. CIVO (Comparative In Vivo Oncology) is an intratumoral microdose injection research tool intended to bridge the translational gap between preclinical and clinical studies by enabling <i>in situ<\/i> assessment of up to 8 oncology drugs or drug combinations simultaneously within a patient&#8217;s tumor. The CIVO Phase 0 model was established under FDA&#8217;s exploratory IND guidelines for microdosing. A Master Protocol was then developed, enabling ongoing evaluation of multiple investigational drugs and combinations without a need for stand-alone new protocols. Each investigational drug or combination is specified as a substudy of the Master Protocol, thus reducing administrative burden to clinical site staff and creating an infrastructure to ensure quality data and oversight of patient safety. This is a multi-center, open-label Phase 0 Master Protocol designed to study the localized pharmacodynamics (PD) of anti-cancer therapies within the TME when administered intratumorally in microdose quantities via the CIVO device. The safety of intratumoral microdose administration via the CIVO device will also be evaluated.<br \/>Materials\/Methods: Approximately 12 subjects are expected to be enrolled per substudy. All substudies will evaluate subjects &#8805;18 years with a diagnosis of solid tumors with scheduled surgical intervention. Eligible subjects have at least one lesion (primary or recurrent tumor or effaced metastatic lymph node) &#8805;2 cm in the shortest diameter that is surface accessible for CIVO injection. Each substudy will define the tumor type and specific eligibility criteria for enrollment. The study visits consist of screening, CIVO injection, surgical intervention, and two follow-up visits. All patients will be injected by the CIVO device containing microdose quantities of drugs specified in respective substudies. The CIVO device can be configured with 3, 5, or 8 needles and the device configuration will be assigned on a per-patient basis, dependent upon lesion size. Following surgical resection, the injected portion of the tumor will undergo central PD biomarker analysis. At the time of submission, the study is open for enrollment with 1 substudy enrolling Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients and 1 substudy enrolling HNSCC or soft tissue sarcoma patients. The Master Protocol was established to efficiently add substudies and accommodate evaluation of a wider repertoire of new agents in order to continually inform and de-risk drug development via the CIVO platform.<br \/>Clinical trial information: NCT04541108.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2abc2198-12fa-412e-954c-b5c0e5ca549e\/@x03B8ZYF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,CIVO,Precision medicine,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20312"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Karthik Rajasekaran<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason G.

Actively recruited tumor associated macrophages (TAM) are abundant in the ST microenvironment (TME) and typically display immunosuppressive behavior. Macrophages engineered to be proinflammatory may be an ideal vector for adoptive ST cellular therapy. Engineered CAR-M selectively recognize and phagocytose antigen overexpressing cancer cells, reprogram TME and present neoantigens to T cells, leading to epitope spreading and immune memory. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression promotes tumorigenesis in many cancers (Table 1). CT-0508 is a cell product comprised of autologous monocyte-derived proinflammatory macrophages expressing an anti-HER2 CAR. Pre-clinical studies show that CT-0508 induces targeted cancer cell phagocytosis while sparing normal cells, decreases tumor burden and prolongs survival, and was safe and effective in a semi-immunocompetent mouse model of human HER2-overexpressing ovarian cancer.<br \/>Methods: This FIH Phase 1 study is evaluating safety, tolerability, cell manufacturing feasibility, trafficking, and preliminary efficacy in 18 subjects with locally advanced\/unresectable or metastatic ST overexpressing HER2, with progression on available therapies, including anti-HER2 therapies. Filgrastim is used to mobilize autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells for monocyte collection by apheresis prior to CT-0508 CAR macrophage infusion. Group 1 subjects receive CT-0508 on D1, 3, &#38; 5. Group 2 subjects will receive full dose on D1. A Safety Review Committee will review dose limiting toxicities. Pre\/post-treatment biopsies and blood samples will be collected for correlative analysis of immunogenicity, trafficking (PCR, RNA scope), CT-0508 persistence in blood and tumor, target antigen engagement, TME modulation (single cell RNA sequencing), immune response (TCR sequencing) and others.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{22C44CF9-ABCD-4986-A891-92AD66224B35}\"><caption>Table 1: Her2 Overexpression Across Tumor Types<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tumor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HER2 Overexpression (%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Bladder<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8 - 70<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Salivary duct<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30 - 40<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gastric<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 - 34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ovarian<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Breast<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11 - 25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Salivary mucoepidermoid<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Esophageal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12 - 14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gallbladder<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.8 - 12.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cholangiocarcinoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.3 - 9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Colorectal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.6 - 5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cervical<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.8 - 3.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Uterine<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Testicular<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.4<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Chimeric antigen receptor,HER2,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21765"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kim A.
