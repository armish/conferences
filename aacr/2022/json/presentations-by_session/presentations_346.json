[{"Abstract":"The existing proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib and ixazomib, are effective in multiple myeloma, but have little activity against solid tumors. These are covalent boronic acid-based compounds and are associated with undesired side effects, mainly hematologic toxicity and peripheral neuropathy. A variety of improved covalent proteasome inhibitors have been developed, but lack of oral availability and low distribution in tumors make them ineffective in solid tumors. In addition, they still have a narrow therapeutic window due to unexpected adverse effects such as cardiac and pulmonary toxicity. We report a non-covalent and rapidly reversible proteasome inhibitor as a potential anti-cancer agent against solid tumors as well as multiple myeloma. These novel inhibitors, called QL compounds, are non-covalent chymotrypsin-like selective proteasome inhibitors that can be taken orally. They effectively inhibited tumor growth in multiple myeloma xenograft model without hematologic toxicity through improved PK properties, especially partition of compound between plasma and RBC. Moreover, this improved PK properties of the QL compounds allowed for sufficient distribution outside the blood compartment and induced tumor growth inhibition in some types of solid cancer xenograft models that were sensitive to proteasome inhibition. These results indicate that non-covalent and rapidly reversible proteasome inhibitors are an ideal strategy for multiple myeloma and potential agents for solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/512f043d-88e5-40ee-8ec8-2793319810cf\/@y03B8ZDB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-08 Proteasome inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome inhibitors,Multiple myeloma,Solid tumors,Antitumor agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15137"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Won-Gyun Ahn<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeejin Jeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeong-In Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaeseung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung-Joo Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uwe Koch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gunther Zischinsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Axel Choidas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ayesha Pasha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bert Klebl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Huber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hamacher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kiyean Nam<\/i><\/presenter>.

Targeted protein degraders (TPDs), also known as heterobifunctional protein degraders or PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs), have drawn great attention as a new modality to overcome drug resistance by achieving selective degradation of disease-causing proteins, like an EGFR mutant protein, which are required for the survival and proliferation of various malignant tumor cells. Therefore, we have developed a series of EGFR mutant degraders using BBT-176, a 4<sup>th<\/sup> generation EGFR TKI developed by Bridge BioTherapeutics, and novel EGFR inhibitors as warheads which are expected not only to treat various EGFR mutated NSCLC including C797S but also to delay drug resistant-mechanisms by further mutations in the EGFR TKI target site.<br \/>We synthesized a set of heterobifunctional degraders applying Cyrus BiFx Degrader (CBD) library platform containing different types of linkers and E3 ligase binders. DC<sub>50<\/sub> (half-maximal degradation concentrations) values of the EGFR degraders were obtained in multiple human EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines, where C-2051, C-2482, and C-4383 showed excellent EGFR degradation potency (DC<sub>50<\/sub> = 7-25 nM, Dmax at 100 nM = 80-97%) with high selectivity against WT EGFR. Among those compounds, C-4383 was potent in cell viability assays with EGFR mutant HCC827 (Del19) and NCI-H1975 (L858R, T790M) cell lines showing a range of GI<sub>50<\/sub> values from 77 to 81&#8201;nM at 72&#8201;h of compound exposure. By contrast, the compound was much less potent in A549 cells harboring wild-type EGFR (GI<sub>50<\/sub> value at 72&#8201;h of treatment, 4.2&#8201;&#956;M). We also performed proteomic analysis of C-4383 in H1975 cells resulting that EGFR was the most degraded protein with no off-target events at 100 nM (Dmax dose). A PK study of C-4383 in rats showed good exposure with moderate CL when administered intravenously (CL = 8.51 mL\/min\/kg, AUC = 5911 ng&#8226;h\/mL).<br \/>In summary, we identified heterobifunctional degraders using a 4th generation EGFR inhibitor, BBT-176, that are active in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells harboring single or C797S-containing multiple mutations. We are currently making our efforts on the improvement of physicochemical properties of EGFR mutant targeted heterobifunctional compounds.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fce128f9-f873-4ecf-8663-d72054859ead\/@y03B8ZDB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,EGFR TKI resistance,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Proteasome-mediated degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15262"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dong Hyuk Ki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joonwoo Nam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunjung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hunmi Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chulwon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiyeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jimmy Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang-Uk Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wooseok Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

Aberrant acetylation has been linked to a wide range of diseases including cancer, inflammation, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Histone acetylation is introduced by histone acetyltransferases complexes (HATs), where substrate specificity is dramatically enhanced by scaffolding proteins that activate and target them to specific chromatin sites. A protein of interest with both epigenetic acetyl reader and scaffolding function is the protein Bromodomain and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1). The Protein contains domains of two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers separated by a zinc knuckle (PZP domain), a bromodomain, and a proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline (PWWP) Tudor domain. Native BRPF1 complexes can contain either MOZ\/MORF or HBO1 as the catalytic MYST-family acetyltransferase subunit and the stable complex with Moz-Tif2 is known to lead to the development of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Given this, we chose to pursue the development of BRPF1 degraders to probe cancer disease biology especially in AML, where new therapies are required to overcome several unmet needs such as less-toxic treatments and relapsed\/refractory disease paradigms. Here we present the design and synthesis of a range of BRPF1 degraders in highly desirable physicochemical space utilizing <i>in-silico <\/i>modeling. The prepared degraders which utilize multiple E3 ligases were then screened against cell lines harboring Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) translocations specifically the THP-1 cell line. In addition to this, we investigated the ability of the compounds to effectively degrade the target and suitability of our degraders for potential <i>in-vivo<\/i> exposure through a panel of routine ADMET assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c4e218a6-5820-4f25-9e32-1b55c1aa31a0\/@y03B8ZDB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Drug discovery,Acute myeloid leukemia,Bromodomain,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15267"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Joseph Glynn<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosie Crampton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Pesnot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Scott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Chloe Nassoy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ralph Kirk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniele Narducci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gary Nelson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lynette Ongiri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Habiba Begum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Rao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matilda Bingham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rhoanne McPherson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Darryl Turner<\/i><\/presenter>.

MCL1 amplifications occur frequently in multiple tumor types. It has also been implicated in mediating resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapies. We have previously described a novel, potent and orally bioavailable MCL1 inhibitor, PRT1419, that demonstrates anti-tumor efficacy in various preclinical models of cancer and is currently under evaluation in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with relapsed\/refractory hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors. In an effort to identify novel biomarkers that might predict sensitivity to MCL1 inhibition, we conducted a gene dependency analysis using publicly available human cancer cell line data generated from genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated cell viability screens. We observed that mutations in the SWI\/SNF complex, particularly in lung and ovarian cancer cell lines, conferred a strong functional dependency on MCL1. The mammalian SWI\/SNF complex functions as a tumor suppressor in a number of cancers and regulates gene expression via chromatin-remodeling. It is comprised of multiple subunits, including one of two catalytic ATPases (<i>SMARCA2<\/i> or <i>SMARAC4<\/i>), DNA-binding proteins <i>ARID1A<\/i>, <i>ARID1B<\/i> and <i>ARID2, <\/i>and other chromatin-binding subunits. Gene mutations in members of this complex occur in &#62;20% of human cancers, and therapeutic agents targeting its function are under active clinical investigation. We and others have shown potent synthetic lethality with the use of SMARCA2 targeted protein degraders in SMARCA4 deleted lung cancer models. A previously published genome-wide CRISPR screen in SMARCA4-mut lung cancer cell lines demonstrated that loss of MCL1 could sensitize these cells to SMARCA2 degradation. Therefore, we evaluated PRT1419 in combination with a novel and selective SMARCA2 degrader, PRT3789, in SMARCA4 deleted lung cancer models. We observed a potent synergistic interaction in SMARCA4 deleted cell lines in vitro, whereas no additive benefit was seen in SMARCA4 WT lines. Further, combining PRT1419 and PRT3789 in vivo in cell line-derived xenograft models resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition, including tumor regressions. Additionally, we profiled PRT1419 ex vivo in a panel of lung cancer PDX models and observed significant, dose-dependent effects on cell viability in SMARCA4 deleted models with low SMARCA2 expression. In a broader lung cancer cell line viability screen conducted with PRT1419, we observed that the presence of multiple, co-occurring alterations in SWI\/SNF family members such as <i>SMARCA4<\/i>, <i>ARID1A\/B <\/i>mutations and loss of SMARCA2 protein were associated with sensitivity to PRT1419. Based on these findings, preclinical evaluation of PRT1419 in other tumor types with recurrent SWI\/SNF mutations is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8fec38ec-43ee-4d9e-92d1-cf3e0bb57083\/@y03B8ZDB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mcl-1,SWI\/SNF,Combination studies,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15270"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Norman Fultang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neha Bhagwat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diane Heiser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Grego<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hulse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Venkat Thodima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koichi Ito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kris Vaddi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce Ruggeri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peggy Scherle<\/i><\/presenter>.

Pathogenesis is driven by the androgen receptor (AR), which has led to front-line treatment modalities that are based on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). About 10-20% of all prostate cancers evolve to resist ADT and are classified as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) indicating the continued need for new treatment options. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is an acetylated-chromatin associating protein that is involved in transcriptional elongation, mRNA splicing, epigenetic bookmarking, and super-enhancer activity. The BRD4 protein has been shown to both bind and colocalize with AR at androgen response elements (AREs) on chromatin. Furthermore, elevated BRD4 expression is prognostic of increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels following radical prostatectomy and is correlated with higher Gleason scores and poor overall survival. The intertwined activity of BRD4 with multiple essential driver mechanisms of prostate cancer suggests it may be a key target for developing novel therapeutics. Using our ultra-high throughput cell-based screening platform, which directly measures degradation of pathogenic proteins upon exposure to diverse chemical libraries, we identified a series of novel monovalent BRD4 degraders that was optimized to produce our lead compound PLX-3618. A cancer cell panel screen for antiproliferative effects of PLX-3618 indicated enhanced sensitivity in subsets of prostate cancer lines. PLX-3618 elicited selective, rapid, and deep degradation of BRD4 protein in prostate cancer cell models, without degrading the closely related BRD2 and BRD3 proteins. Addition of either proteosome or neddylation inhibitors blocked BRD4 degradation indicating a ubiquitin-proteosome system mediated clearance mechanism. Degradation of BRD4 led to sustained multimodal inhibition of the AR pathway and disruption of key oncogene enhancer networks. When compared to pan-BET inhibitors, treatment of select prostate cancer cell lines with PLX-3618 resulted in increased levels of the tumor suppressors p53 and p21, an aberrant DNA damage response, and substantially amplified apoptosis. Finally, in <i>in vivo<\/i> preclinical models of prostate cancer, PLX-3618 showed far superior efficacy over a pan-BET inhibitor.

The oncogenicity of mutant p53 includes sustained proliferation, increased survival and resistance to therapy, increased invasion and metastasis, and genomic instability. The oncogenicity of mutant p53 is related to its stability and accumulation in cells by evading degradation by the proteasome. Therefore, destabilization of mutant p53 has been sought as a therapeutic strategy, but so far without clinical success. We and others observe that proteasome inhibitors cause paradoxical depletion of mutant p53 in lung cancer cell lines.<br \/><b>Objectives:<\/b> In this project, we sought to determine the mechanism(s) of mutant p53 depletion by proteasome inhibition and its therapeutic implications in lung cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Human lung cancer cell lines bearing mutant p53 and wildtype p53 (WTp53) were used in this study. An isogenic panel of cell lines with mutant p53, WTp53 and a vector control was also used to determine mutant p53 dependency of the observed effects. Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, siRNA technology, DNA transfection were used for protein detection, protein-protein interactions, gene knock-down and overexpression respectively. Cycloheximide chase assay was used to determine protein degradation. The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) analysis was performed using the cBioPortal platform.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Proteasome inhibitors resulted in depletion of mutant p53 in the lung cancer cell line H1975. This effect was also confirmed using the isogenic model described above. Depletion of mutant p53 occurred through a degradation mechanism and was time dependent. While WTp53 accumulated at initial timepoints of proteasome inhibition, mutant p53 did not accumulate but instead depleted with time. This suggested that the proteasome is not the primary mechanism for mutant p53, in contrast to WTp53. Since autophagy is an alternative mechanism of protein degradation in eukaryotes, we evaluated for, and found evidence of autophagy upon proteasome inhibition. We further showed that autophagic degradation of mutant p53 could involve the heat shock protein 70. Our TCGA data analysis showed proteasome genes amplification in mutant p53 lung cancers, suggesting a possible functional dependency. Furthermore, RNA sequencing analysis showed upregulation of most proteasome genes upon stable expression of the R273H mutant in p53-null lung cancer cell line. Finally, in vitro cell viability assays using two different proteasome inhibitors showed increased sensitivity of the lung cancer cell line with mutant p53 compared to WTp53.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The cumulative evidence of proteasome hyperactivity, degradation of mutant p53 and in vitro evidence of increased susceptibility of mutant p53 lung cancer cell lines suggests that proteasome inhibitors warrant a closer attention for therapeutic targeting of mutant p53 in lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55d00456-209d-48c1-ab96-45e12b1e3a58\/@y03B8ZDB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-08 Proteasome inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Proteasome inhibitors,Lung cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15275"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eziafa I.

Our group recently discovered LCK dependency as a therapeutic vulnerability in 33% of T-ALL and LCK inhibitor dasatinib exhibited strong efficacy <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>(<i>Nat Cancer<\/i> 2, 284, 2021). However, the transient LCK inhibition by dasatinib resulted in only partial responses, and novel agents are needed to suppress LCK signaling in T-ALL in a sustained fashion to achieve long-term efficacy. We synthesized a set of proteolytic targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that bring LCK to cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase for ubiquitination and degradation. LCK-PROTACs showed extremely high anti-leukemia sensitivity, i.e., up to 1,561.3 fold increase over dasatinib in LCK-activated T-ALL cell line. Complete LCK degradation was induced by most LCK-PROTACs. Based on solubility, permeability, stability, and anti-leukemia effects <i>in vitro<\/i>, we prioritized SJ001011646 for further evaluations. SJ001011646 induced 50% LCK degradation at the concentration at ~0.001nM, with superior cytotoxic effects in patient-derived primary T-ALL samples compared to dasatinib. In addition, we confirmed the formation of ternary complex of LCK, SJ001011646, and CRBN, using the AlphaLISA assay. In a wash-out experiment, LCK-dependent T-ALL cells were exposed to SJ001011646 or dasatinib for 18 hours and then monitored for viability recovery. Both dasatinib and SJ001011646 led to dramatic growth inhibition within 2 days. While dasatinib-treated cells started to recover 96 hours after drug removal, cells treated with SJ001011646 failed to recover even after 240 hours. To systematically identify therapeutic targets of SJ001011646, we performed proteomic profiling of T-ALL cells before and after drug treatment <i>in vitro<\/i>. Overall, 126,670 unique peptides were identified and mapped to 10,158 proteins, of which LCK was most significantly reduced by PROTAC. In parallel, kinome-binding profiling confirmed LCK as a primary target of SJ001011646. Finally, we explored pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of SJ001011646 <i>in vivo<\/i>, using patient-derived xenograft models of T-ALL. Given at the same dosage level as a single injection, SJ001011646 showed 367% increase in the duration of LCK suppression compared to dasatinib. Taken together, we described the development and preclinical evaluation of LCK-targeting PROTACs in T-ALL. Inducing proximity to CRBN and therefore degradation, these agents can produce sustained LCK suppression with much improved anti-leukemia efficacy than small molecule inhibitors, and are therefore promising novel therapeutic agents in T-ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/89eda062-b124-4c02-9415-0cefb569f429\/@y03B8ZDB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,Tyrosine kinase,Therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15290"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jianzhong Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamie Jarusiewicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaeki Min<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Divyabharathi Chepyala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marisa Actis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guoqing Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon Smart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dylan Maxwell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boer Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Yoshimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junming Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David T.

STAT3 protein dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to eventually transactivate downstream target genes. Despite some progress has been made in the past two decades, to date there is still lack of FDA-approved STAT3 inhibitors available for clinical use. Recently, proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology has dramatically advanced the development of therapeutics by introducing targeted protein degradation. Previously, our team has developed HJC0152, a promising STAT3 inhibitor, via structure- and fragment-based drug design strategies and <i>in silico<\/i> molecular modeling and docking. HJC0152 has demonstrated an attractive cancer therapeutic and preventive efficacy by targeting the non- estrogen receptor (ER)-based STAT3 signaling pathway. To achieve better potency and inhibition of STAT3 signaling, we therefore developed a series of HJC0152-based PROTAC protein degraders. These potential anticancer agents have been initially evaluated and several showed favorable potency in inhibiting the proliferation in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. We found that compounds JMX1122, JMX1123, and JMX1124 significantly inhibited proliferation and colony formation of a highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231, and the ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. Different from the lead compound HJC0152, which showed an early inhibition on the phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 and Ser727 residues, the newly developed HJC0152-PROTACs showed a significantly late differential inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation at the Tyr705 and Ser727 residues, and reduced the total STAT3 protein level at 72 hours of treatment. Our current results support the notion that HJC0152-based PROTAC degraders potently suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, via direct targeting of STAT3 and its protein degradation. These compounds are currently being investigated for breast cancer cell migration and invasion, and will be evaluated for the <i>in vivo<\/i> inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in different mouse models.

Drugs such as Abiraterone or Enzalutamide that target the Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) of AR are largely ineffective on AR splice variants (AR-SVs) that lack LBD and retain the N-terminal Domain (NTD) of AR. AR continues to function through other stimuli (ex: growth factors), leading to disease relapse and progression. Moreover, AR-SVs are known to heterodimerize with AR full length (AR-FL). Hence, treatment strategies that target both AR-FL and AR-NTD are needed for the complete remission of CRPC. Through structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies based on naturally occurring Urolithin A (UroA) structure, we have developed a novel small molecule UroBoc that directly binds to the NTD and inhibits CRPC growth.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To analyze the binding of UroBoc to AR-NTD, we performed differential scanning fluorimetry and measured saturation transfer difference (STD) in NMR spectroscopic studies. In addition, we investigated the effect of UroBoc on CRPC by western blotting, immunofluorescence, Immunoprecipitation, and performed Xenograft studies in castrated\/non-castrated mice models.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>UroBoc treatment shifted the melt temperature (&#916;Tm) of purified NTD by 12-15 &#176;C (median of 13.5 &#176;C) in differential scanning fluorimetry. Moreover, STD effects observed were 30-18%, indicating a significant binding to NTD in our NMR studies. UroBoc inhibits the growth of AR+ CRPC, including enzalutamide resistant cells, at 800nM concentration, which is 40 times lower than that of the parent compound, UroA. At this concentration, UroBoc is non-toxic to normal prostate epithelial cells or other cancer cells. Interestingly, UroBoc also inhibited AR, AR-SV and PSA expressions in AR-FL (LNCaP, C42B) and AR-V7 (22-RV1) CRPC cell lines. Molecular studies suggested that UroBoc selectively promotes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of AR and AR-V7 by proteasome activation.

Oridonin is a natural diterpene compound enriched in the medicinal herb <i>Rabdosia rubescens<\/i>, and its anticancer property has been extensively studied. However, the potency of oridonin against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) limits its potential clinical translation. Previously, we developed a class of oridonin analogues including CYD0618 and others as effective anticancer agents to inhibit tumor growth of TNBC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Intriguingly, CYD0618 has been shown to directly bind to and inhibit STAT3 transcription factor, which is constitutively activated in the majority of human cancers. Currently there are no FDA-approved direct STAT3 inhibitors in clinical use. Based on the proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology, our team designed novel oridonin- and CYD0618-based PROTACs in an attempt to achieve specific STAT3 binding and protein degradation. We determined anticancer effects of oridonin- and CYD0618-PROTACs on proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. We found that oridonin- and CYD0618-based PROTACs inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells significantly, similarly effective as the lead compound CYD0618 and much more potent than oridonin. We then examined the expression of STAT3, pSTAT3 and protein biomarkers for tumor metastasis using Western blot. STAT3 and pSTAT3 protein levels were downregulated dose- and time-dependently in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CYD0618 and CYD0618-PROTACs, respectively.<b> <\/b>Our results demonstrate impressive effects of CYD0618-based PROTACs against TNBC cells, primarily through direct targeting of STAT3. We are in the process of further characterizing the molecular profile of CYD0618-based PROTACs by studying its interaction with STAT3 and protein degradation as well as their efficacy against TNBC tumor xenografts <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c68c3929-f867-4753-b746-93bb3adb13a1\/@y03B8ZDB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,oridonin analogs,PROTAC,STAT3 protein degraders,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15495"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ruixia Ma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pingyuan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junhai Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jimin Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Doerte R.

Therefore, SHP2 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for human cancers and other human diseases. While some allosteric inhibitors that are being tested in clinical trials, a few SHP2 degraders have been developed recently. However, their activities in human lung cancer have not been tested. The current study focused on evaluating the therapeutic potential of the novel SHP2 degrader, SHP2-D26 (D26), either alone or in combination, against non-small cell lung cancer cell (NSCLC). Most of tested NSCLC cell lines (12\/14) were insensitive to the control small molecule SHP2 inhibitor with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of far over 10 &#956;M. However, all these cell lines responded to D26 with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of &#60; 8 &#956;M. A few cell lines (4\/14; e.g. HCC827, PC-9, H1792 and H1648) were much more sensitive than others with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of &#60; 3 &#956;M. There was no clear association between basal levels of SHP2 and cell sensitivities to D26. Interestingly, D26 rapidly and potently decreased SHP2 levels in all the tested cell lines in a sustained way regardless cell sensitivities to D26, suggesting that there may be additional factors that impact cell response to D26. We noted that suppression of p70S6\/S6, but not ERK1\/2, was associated with cell responses to D26, warranting further study in this direction. In the sensitive cell lines, D26 effectively increased Bim levels while decreasing Mcl-1 levels likely through modulating their stability accompanied with induction of apoptosis. These events are all important for D26 to induce apoptosis. When combined with the third generation EGFR, osimertinib (AZD9291), synergistic effects on decreasing the survival of different osimertinib-resistant cell lines were observed. Moreover, the combination enhanced induction of apoptosis in these osimertinib-resistant cells. Although D26 alone exerted moderate effect on inhibiting the growth of NSCLC xenografts, the combination of osimertinib with D26 very effectively inhibited the growth of osimertinib-resistant xenografts, suggesting promising efficacy in overcoming acquired resistance to osimertinib. Our findings thus warrant further evaluation of the potential of D26 in overcoming acquired resistance to osimertinib in clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c525294b-2dbb-44a9-87a4-86452a39a1cc\/@q03B8ZDC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Targeted therapy,Drug synergy,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15544"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yunful Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangzhi Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karin A.

Current antiandrogen therapies directly or indirectly target the AR ligand binding domain (LBD) and are initially effective in prostate cancer patients. However, resistance ultimately develops, and new methods of inhibiting the AR pathway are needed. The selective targeting of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the AR by small molecule anitens represents a novel method of blocking AR signaling that can bypass LBD-related resistance mechanisms. AR NTD is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) which has no stable ordered structure and is generally regarded as an undruggable target due to the lack of a well-defined small-molecule binding pocket. However, we recently demonstrated that EPI-7386, an AR NTD small molecule inhibitor, inhibits AR activity by binding to Tau5 region of the NTD. By developing an aniten based bifunctional degrader (ANITAC for ANITen bAsed Chimera), our goal is to eliminate any forms of AR protein found in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), that can potentially drive disease progression, including LBD mutants and AR truncated variants.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> AR degradation was monitored by Western Blot or by using the HiBit assay. AR transcriptional activity was measured using different reporter assays following AR full length (FL) or truncated AR activity in in vitro models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Here we report the first series of AR degraders targeting the NTD of AR, which lead to degradation of all forms of AR, including AR-V7 and AR-v567es. ANITACs eliminate AR in all cell lines tested through an E3 ligase dependent mechanism, with an observed 50% degradation concentration (DC<sub>50<\/sub>) &#60; 20 nM in 22Rv1 cells for the most potent compounds. AR degradation mediated by ANITACs suppresses the expression of AR target genes and decreases the viability of prostate cancer cells. ANITACs also degrade clinically relevant AR mutants and AR splice variants and show inhibition of AR transcriptional activity in multiple cell lines expressing different forms of AR including AR FL (LNCaP, CWR-AD1), AR-V7 (22Rv1), AR-V567es (CWR-D567). In vitro and in vivo PK studies show the compounds are metabolically stable and exhibit excellent oral bioavailability in mice.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In summary, we report preclinical data on the first generation of ANITAC molecules, that can be orally bioavailable and show activity against forms of AR expressed in late stage CRPC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/11d3edd0-7595-4368-b835-edcfd1bbda43\/@q03B8ZDC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Prostate cancer,Proteasome-mediated degradation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18162"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Nan Hyung Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Berenger Biannic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Virsik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han-Jie Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ronan Le Moigne<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
