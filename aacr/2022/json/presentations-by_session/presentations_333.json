[{"Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b>: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare delivery, which is widely discussed as the distraction effect. This study aimed to estimate the distraction effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea by analyzing colorectal and gastric cancer screening rates in the years 2019 and 2020.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Information of eligible population who had colorectal and gastric cancer screening provided by the National Cancer Screening Program in the years 2019 and 2020 was collected. Participation rates were analyzed by age group, sex, geographic region, and calendar month. Percentage change was calculated by dividing the percentage point difference by the screening rate of the reference period (2019).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Overall, the colorectal and gastric cancer screening rates had decreased in 2020, compared to the reference period. For colorectal cancer, the screening rate decreased from 68.3% in 2019 (5,886,319 participants\/14,526,424 eligible population) to 54.6% in 2020 (5,135,218\/9,410,525) For gastric cancer, the screening rates decreased from 61.9% in 2019 (7,194,489 \/11,625,627) to 54.6% in 2020 (6,244,491\/11,439,246). In March, during the first wave, the screening rates declined sharply (percentage change: colorectal, 56.6%; gastric, 57.3%). Although the screening rates had rebounded aftermath, they declined again in December, during the third wave (percentage change: colorectal, 17.0%; gastric, 13.8%). According to specific-age group, we found a substantial decline in screening rates for older adults aged 80~84, and those over 85 (percentage change: colorectal, 19.0% &#38; 23.0%; gastric, 17.4% &#38; 25.1% respectively).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the screening rates for both colorectal and gastric cancer decreased. There was a substantial decline during the first and the third waves of the epidemic, in March and in December. The older adults group showed the highest reduction in screening rates. However, comparing the screening rate by region and sex, we did not find a significant difference. Delayed cancer diagnosis or excess death due to distraction effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been detected in Korea, therefore, further studies are needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7379e58-897b-4455-91d5-14a9c4c55ac4\/@u03B8ZCB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-02 Cancer prevention and early detection during the COVID-19 pandemic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,Colorectal cancer,Gastric cancer,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16500"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seung Hee Seo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyeree Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jong Heon Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhumsuk Keam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shin Hye Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aesun Shin<\/i><\/presenter>.

To accommodate this change and remain accessible, the University of Arizona Cancer Center&#8217;s Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) transitioned cancer education efforts to virtual webinars and social media. These multilingual and multicultural efforts were targeted toward residents of Arizona, as well as a broader network of participants.<br \/>Objective: To develop accessible, virtual programming to engage communities across Arizona during the COVID-19 pandemic to continue cancer education and health promotion efforts in bilingual (English and Spanish) webinars where possible.<br \/>Methods: Utilizing a vibrant social media presence, the COE team developed a weekly webinar series, entitled Let&#8217;s Taco &#8216;Bout Cancer!, a monthly Morning Cat Chat webinar, and an annual &#8220;Col-Chella&#8221; festival that focuses on cancer education. These series are based on informal interviews and conversations with cancer researchers, community health partners, cancer survivors\/caretakers, and community advisory board members. All presentations were streamed via Zoom, social media accounts, and YouTube to be accessible for later use. Lastly, demonstration webinars (e.g. food preparation) for healthy behaviors were also implemented.<br \/>Results: Since March 2020, more than 22,000 viewers have been recorded over 122 virtual cancer-related presentations that were given. Sixty-one percent of the presentations were in English and 39% were in Spanish. Collected surveys indicate the median age of the audience is 55 years old, 77% females, and 43% community members. Twenty-nine (29) percent identify as Hispanic, 48% as non-Hispanic white, and 17% as American Indian\/Alaska Native. Evaluations reported that 86% of the audience were engaged, 94% that their knowledge was increased, and 69% indicated that their knowledge is applicable. Eighty-seven (87) percent thought the research topics discussed benefits their community and 83% preferred to receive cancer education materials via email. The collected evaluations indicate the audience&#8217;s top three priorities from the cancer center include: cancer prevention, education, and patient care.<br \/>Discussion: Based on collected data, offering multicultural and multilingual outreach efforts virtually has allowed the COE team to continuously operate as an educational resource serving our diverse communities. Interacting and inviting members from Arizona&#8217;s Hispanic and American Indian communities, along with health professionals, has made the Cancer Center more relative to the population it serves as well as allowing Arizona residents to hear from their own community. Overtime, in-person efforts will resume with the inclusion of virtual engagement to have a well-rounded approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/37d7fcdf-99f9-4329-8e02-56a4c9a33571\/@u03B8ZCB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-02 Cancer prevention and early detection during the COVID-19 pandemic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Cancer education,Community outreach,COVID-19,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16501"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Monica Yellowhair<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Desiree Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriela Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Octavio Castanos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rene D.

However, the uptake of this vaccine remains sub-optimal in the US, with further exacerbation of this poor uptake during the pandemic. This study aims to describe changes and barriers to HPV vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic as observed by healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the state of Texas.<br \/>Methods: Data for this study were derived from a statewide cross-sectional survey of HCPs in the state of Texas (n=1283). Survey instruments were developed at MD Anderson Cancer Center, and reviewed by its IRB. Survey frequencies were used to estimate for the proportional distribution of changes as observed by HCPs regarding HPV vaccination i) uptake ii) hesitancy and iii) refusal during the COVID-19 pandemic. HCPs who observed increases in vaccination hesitancy or refusal, were then asked for the reasons cited by their patients. Survey frequencies were then used to determine the proportional distribution of the reasons cited for HPV vaccination hesitancy and refusal during the pandemic. All statistical analysis were conducted using R version 3.5.2.<br \/>Results: Overall, 730 HCPs responded to the study questions of interest. A predominant proportion of respondents were employed in group practice settings or university teaching \/ affiliated hospitals. About 20% of HCPs in Texas observed decreases in HPV vaccination uptake. Observed increments in HPV vaccination hesitancy and refusal were reported by 17.1% and 14.8% of HCPs, respectively. Among HCPs who observed increased hesitancy and refusal, difficulties in scheduling clinic visit during the pandemic and fear of contracting corona virus during the clinic visit were the most cited reasons.<br \/>Discussion: Findings of the index study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on HPV vaccination in Texas. Results identify perceived barriers to HPV vaccination unique to the pandemic. With the pandemic still ongoing, amid the emergence of novel strains with heightened virulence, despite the presence of highly effective FDA-approved vaccines, findings of this study provides useful insight for public health interventions, as well as to guide physician-patient interactions around HPV vaccination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f1b34330-9877-4b8a-bbe6-b1406f0dc3f7\/@v03B8ZCC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-02 Cancer prevention and early detection during the COVID-19 pandemic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Epidemiology,Vaccines,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16502"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Onyema Chido-Amajuoyi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mala Pande<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjay Shete<\/i><\/presenter>.

In addition to known risk groups, also cancer patients are at increased risk for severe disease progression. Therefore, understanding the nature of the accompanying immune response is essential, especially the role of T cells for successful virus defense but also during immunopathology leading to severe disease outcomes. Furthermore, as neutralizing antibodies are reported to decay within months post infection or vaccination or are even absent due to cancer treatment, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell persistence is discussed as an indicator of long-term protective immunity. Especially, in immunocompromised cancer patients, levels of SARS-CoV-2-specifc antibodies may not be efficiently detected. Therefore, we developed a rapid and easy flow cytometric assay for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells directly from whole blood.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad783033-68e6-458f-9bd7-679b368723c7\/@v03B8ZCC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-06 COVID-19 vaccines and immune responses among cancer patients,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Immune response,Flow cytometry,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16505"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lorenz Fülle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp David Gert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Verena Traska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofia Chatzopoulou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Dose<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Richter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Schuster<\/i><\/presenter>.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool in the identification and characterization of this pathogen and genomic information may aid in understanding the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, vaccine escape, virulence, and pathogenicity. The Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel is a targeted NGS solution that facilitates sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Paired with a bioinformatics assembly and variant calling pipelines, this assay allows for accurate characterization of the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant. This assay&#8217;s performance was analytically validated for the detection of mutations (substitutions, insertions, and deletions) in RNA derived from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs.<br \/>Method: The Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research panel consists of two primer pair pools generating 237 amplicons specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Reverse transcription of the RNA was performed using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis kit. Library preparation was then completed using the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit Plus kit. The final library was quantified, normalized, pooled, and sequenced. Raw sequencing data was aligned to the AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research panel, using the MN908947.3 reference genome. Variants were called using the Torrent Variant Caller and annotated using the COVID19AnnotateSnpEff plugin. The reference-guided iterative assembler IRMA was used to produce a single consensus sequence consisting of the reference genome sequence modified to include sequence variations supported by the reads. The Pangolin COVID-19 lineage assigner software tool was used to assign SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Analytical validation was completed using controls (Twist Biosciences, BEI Resources, ATCC) and RNA derived from NP swabs. Accuracy and specificity were examined by evaluating the correctness of calling true negative variants compared to false positive and all other variant calls, respectively. Precision and limit of detection (LoD) were examined by evaluating the concordance of variants across replicate samples. Limit of Blank (LoB) was calculated as the 95<sup>th<\/sup> percentile of reads per amplicon in the negative samples.<br \/>Results: Accuracy of base calling, specificity, and precision were 100% for SNVs, insertions, and deletions above 25% allele frequency. LoD was determined to be 576 viral copies\/mL. LoB was determined to be 202 reads per amplicon. Pangolin lineage assignment was 100% for all samples.<br \/>Conclusions: This panel accurately characterizes SARS-CoV-2 variants, allowing for accurate consensus sequence generation, mutation annotation, and lineage assignment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d507b973-5eaa-4530-8eb1-9d02bfc453d5\/@v03B8ZCC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-07 Diagnostics for COVID-19 testing: Design, development, and validation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19,COVID,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16508"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Desiree Unselt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Knudsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Rounds<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janet Doolittle-Hall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Fernando Torres<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Sims<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Mason<\/i><\/presenter>.

The National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP) of Korea provides screening services for six common cancers - stomach, liver, colorectum, breast, cervix, and lung. As complete national lockdown measures were not implemented, the NCSP continued operation during the three major COVID-19 waves in Korea, which allowed us to assess the changes in health-seeking behavior. We examined the cancer screening rates for breast and cervical cancers among NCSP participants in different geographic regions and by age group, in association with the COVID-19 pandemic.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>From the National Health Insurance Service database, we obtained information on the number of eligible population and NCSP participants from January 2019 to December 2020. The target group for biennial mammography screening is women aged 40 years and over, and that for biennial pap smear is women aged 20 years and over. We compared monthly screening rates for breast and cervical cancer between 2020 vs 2019 and described them as a percentage change.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The overall cancer screening rate has decreased in both cancers in 2020 compared with that of 2019: breast (55.8% vs 63.8%), cervical (52.2% vs 57.8%). Screening rates for both cancers declined in all age groups in March and December of 2020, which corresponds to the first and third COVID-19 wave. The month of March 2020 had the sharpest drop in screening rates, by 57.9% for breast cancer and 43.7% for cervical cancer compared with March 2019. In June 2020, screening rates for both cancers rebounded compared with 2019 (breast, +29.2%; cervical, +26.3%), which remained higher compared with the same months in 2019 until November 2020. By December 2020, screening rates for both cancers have dropped, compared with December 2019 (breast, -19.5%; cervical, -21.0%). For breast cancer, the screening rate decreased in all age groups, and the largest decline was observed in women aged 80 years and over. Although the cervical cancer screening rate has been steadily increasing since 2010, it decreased in all age groups in 2020 compared with that of 2019, with the exception of the 20-29 age group. Considering social distancing measures that were implemented nationwide during each COVID-19 wave, we observed a similar pattern of cancer screening rates in major cities.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>It was observed that after the two major COVID-19 waves, mammography and pap smear rates declined compared with that of 2019. The largest decline in cancer screening rates was seen in elderly women. The pattern of screening rate changes was comparable according to geographic region. In contrast to reports showing a deficit in cancer screening in other countries, our results suggest a substantial recovery in cancer screening in Korea.

Cancer-related psychological distress is common in patients, and it has been implicated in increasing mortality risk. Findings from prior studies suggest that individuals undergoing cancer treatment in rural areas experience greater psychosocial distress than their urban counterparts. Given healthcare access barriers in rural areas, the COVID-19 pandemic may present an even greater strain on these patients. However, the impact of COVID-19 on psychosocial distress among rural cancer patients is unclear. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine changes in psychosocial distress among rural thoracic oncology patients before and after the onset of COVID-19. We also examined whether demographic, geographic, or clinical factors were associated with overall distress within this population. All thoracic oncology patients treated at Cowell Family Cancer Center (CFCC) in rural Michigan from January 1, 2019 through January 1, 2020 (pre-COVID-19, n=139) and from January 1, 2020 through January 31, 2021 (during COVID-19, n=84) were included in this study. Data on patient demographics, degree of rurality, cancer site, and NCCN psychosocial distress measures were abstracted from the electronic medical records. We assessed differences in participant characteristics and psychosocial distress measures between the pre-COVID and during COVID groups using Chi-square, Fisher&#8217;s exact, and t-tests. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we estimated odds ratios and 95% CI for associations between participant characteristics and psychosocial distress. Overall psychosocial distress scores were higher during COVID-19 versus before the pandemic (6.5 vs. 5.8, p=0.045). Differences in specific problems contributing to psychosocial distress were also observed. For example, participants were more likely to report being worried about needing help with daily tasks (25.0% vs. 8.6%, p=.001), fear and worry about the future (60.7% vs. 40.3%, p=.003), feeling more dependent on others (45.2% vs. 33.1%, p=.07), and changes in urination (14.3% vs. 5.0%, p=0.02) during vs. before the pandemic. Being single was associated with higher psychosocial distress compared to married individuals (OR=5.29, 95% CI=1.12, 24.7), while age, distance to hospital, rurality, sex, and occupational status were not significant predictors. Findings from this study suggest increases in psychosocial distress among rural thoracic oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on overall distress and quality of life among cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/28f412ed-2524-466a-aef9-e04b4493f3f7\/@v03B8ZCC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-11 Health inequities and disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Distress,Rural,COVID-19,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16513"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sierra Silverwood<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Hirko<\/i><\/presenter>.

It remains unclear how African Americans with and without cancer have been affected.<br \/>Aim: To determine epidemiological, clinical comorbidities, and laboratory test results to identify markers associated with mortality in COVID-19 cancer patients.<u><\/u><br \/>Methods: We reviewed all COVID-19 hospitalized patient records from Dec. 2019 to Nov. 2021 at Howard University Hospital. Patients having a history of, or active cancer status were reviewed. All the clinical, treatment, lab values, and pathological data were extracted. Statistical analysis of the COVID-19 cancer patients and comparison with non-cancer COVID-19 patients were performed using univariate and multivariate analyses.<br \/><u><\/u> Results: Out of 800 COVID-19 infected patients, a total of 49 patients were identified with different types of cancer, with both active and previous history. Females consisted of 26 cancer patients (53%). Cancer patients were older than non-cancer patients (mean age-70.6 vs. 56.3 years) and had an increased length of hospital stay (mean 13.9 vs 9.4 days). Among cancer patients, breast cancer was more prevalent in females and prostate cancer in males, (54% and 52% respectively). In both cases and controls, univariate and multivariate analyses did not show any correlation between individual symptoms or clinical comorbidities and death. Higher reduction in albumin level in cancer cases, from the time of admission to day five, was significantly associated with death during the same hospital stay compared to those who were discharged (p&#60;0.001). In controls, lymphocytes count, AST, and Albumin have shown an association with increased mortality. Comparison of patients with active vs. previous cancer showed no significant difference in the clinical outcome, death vs discharge (P=0.34).<br \/>Conclusion: Albumin level has shown to have an inverse relationship with clinical outcomes among all COVID infected African American patients. Reduction in Albumin level during the hospital stay, particularly in COVID-19 cancer patients should be considered as a predictor of mortality. No significant difference was noticed in the clinical outcome in patients with previous versus active cancer. Further research with a large cohort size is needed to verify and identify other predictors of outcome in COVID-19 cancer patients and develop appropriate treatment modalities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bce972da-475d-4d27-b448-ad9cf4bce9fe\/@w03B8ZCD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-11 Health inequities and disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,African American,Mortality,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16516"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Suryanarayana reddy Challa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lakshmi Gayathri Chirumamilla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nader Shayegh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josie Z Fazzino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adeyinka O.

To date there is one reported case of COVID-associated IRIS in a neutropenic patient treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Here we describe a second case of COVID-associated IRIS in a patient with history of follicular lymphoma who received G-CSF during acute COVID-19 infection.<br \/><b>Case: <\/b>A 64-year-old woman with history of follicular lymphoma and autologous stem cell transplant one year prior presented with dyspnea, diarrhea, and fever, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. She had received three doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. She was admitted to the hospital for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and treated with remdesivir 100mg, dexamethasone 6mg, and 2 L\/min supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula for five days. Twelve days after discharge, the patient returned with persistent diarrhea, fatigue, fever, and an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. She again tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with oxygen at 30 L\/min and 50% FiO2 and treated with methylprednisolone 1 mg\/kg daily. On admission, her D-dimer was 3943 ng\/mL, C-reactive protein 136 mg\/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 767\/mcL, platelets 84\/mcL. Her chest CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism but demonstrated bilateral ground glass opacities characteristic of COVID-19 pneumonia. Her ANC reached a nadir of 186 on day 3 at which point G-CSF (filgrastim 300 mcg\/day) was administered for three days with subsequent neutrophil recovery. On day 6, in light of a negative test for COVID antibodies, she received high-dose monoclonal antibodies through a compassionate use program. At that time, her oxygen requirements were stable and inflammatory markers had decreased to CRP 25 and D-Dimer 940. However, her oxygen requirements and inflammatory markers rapidly increased thereafter, with HFNC settings up to 60L\/80%, D-dimer 27754, and CRP 135. After a repeat chest CT on day 8 showed worsened ground glass opacities throughout all lung fields, her steroid dose was increased to methylprednisolone 2 mg\/kg daily out of concern for COVID-associated IRIS following G-CSF administration. Her oxygen requirement and inflammatory markers declined over the following 2-3 days and she was transferred out of the ICU.<br \/><b>Discussion: <\/b>We present here an unusual case of COVID-associated IRIS after G-CSF administration in a transplant patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. Given the increased risk of infection and severe illness in immunosuppressed patients despite vaccination, it is important for providers to be aware of complications associated with adjunct therapies such as G-CSF in this vulnerable population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6650240a-6403-49bf-aa2e-73669a75abce\/@w03B8ZCD\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-13 Risk factors and comorbidities resulting in adverse outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Growth factor,Immune response,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16519"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chloe S.

Risk of these severe complications in pts with cancer is unknown. We estimated the incidence of arterial thrombosis (AT) and venous thromboembolism (VT) using RWD from pts with active or history of cancer with COVID19.<br \/>Methods: Adult pts with cancer receiving treatment in community health systems, with COVID19 identified via ICD code or lab confirmation in 2020, were reviewed for incident AT and VT in a 90 day window following COVID19 diagnosis (index). AT was acute myocardial infarction (MI) or acute ischemic or embolic stroke (S). VT was acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Medication use (anticoagulant, antiplatelet, statin) and comorbidities were assessed 6 months and 1 year prior to index, respectively.<br \/>Results: Median age of 7,591 pts with cancer and COVID19 was 67 years and median follow up was 90 days. 32% of pts were hospitalized within 14 days, 2% received ventilator support, 6% had cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 1% had prior VT. Absolute risk of VT was significantly higher than AT (3% vs. 2%, chi square p= &#60; 0.001), with 161 pts experiencing AT [81 (1%) MI; 80 (1%) S] and 240 pts experiencing VT [99 (1%) DVT; 158 (2%) PE]. This trend held across most subgroups (Table 1). The incidence rate per person-year was 0.094 for AT (0.047 MI, 0.046 S) and 0.141 for VT (0.058 DVT, 0.092 PE). CoxPH models did not show age, sex, comorbidities or medication use as significantly associated with higher probability of AT or VT.<br \/>Conclusions: RWD showed pts with cancer and COVID19 were at higher risk for VT than AT. Pts who received ventilator support, or had prior VT or prior CVD had highest risk for these events. Severity of these outcomes emphasizes the need for risk reducing interventions.

The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors contributing to death from COVID-19 infection in the cancer population at Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS).<br \/>Materials and Methods:<b> <\/b> 507 patients were evaluated that had a diagnosis of any solid or hematologic malignancy and admitted to the inpatient service at VCUHS while having a COVID-19 PCR positive test between February 2020 and June 2021. Patient characteristics as well as comorbidities, transplant status, ventilator dependence, intensive care admission, and malignancy type were recorded. Death was recorded as being due to COVID-19 or COVID-19 complications. Logistic regression model was used to determine odds ratio (OR) of death from COVID 19. Results were listed with respective OR both unadjusted and adjusted for age, race, sex, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).<br \/>Results: Of the 507 patients, 37 experienced death (7.3%). Only 40 patients required ICU admission (7.9%) and 24 required ventilator support (4.7%). Increased age per 5-year increments was associated with increased risk of death in adjusted and unadjusted analysis (OR 1.30 (1.06,1.63) and 1.26 (1.10,1.46)). There was no significant risk of death in either adjusted or unadjusted analysis between Caucasian, African American, Asian or unspecified races. When not adjusted, COPD (OR 2.56, 1.28-5.11), CAD (OR 2.69, 1.36-5.32), and CKD (OR 2.14, 1.09-4.21) were all shown to have significant risk of death. However, when adjusted, there were no significant difference in odds ratio between patients with diabetes, CAD, COPD, and CKD. When adjusted, malignancies of central nervous system (CNS) (OR 70.30, 2.18-1520.3), hematologic (OR 4.79, 1.05-30.77), and head and neck (OR 11.64, 1.58-100.01) were at increased risk of death; while female associated malignancies, genitourinary (GU), lung, connective tissue, and those with multiple primary malignancies did not have significant risk. Ventilatory dependence did increase mortality risk (OR 50.54, 7.62,459.7), while transplant status and intensive care unit admission did not.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>Based on the results from this study, there is an increased risk of death from COVID-19 infections in several variables in the cancer population at VCUHS. Age, ventilator dependence, CNS, hematologic, and head and neck malignancies were all associated with increased mortality. Further evaluation will include the 13 other patients in which data was not yet available. Other variables that will be evaluated are COVID treatments, vaccination status, antibody formation, cancer treatment modality used within 30 days of COVID diagnosis, and lab values including cell counts and inflammatory markers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/efc194e6-fda6-48a9-85a8-88a1a8777a22\/@w03B8ZCD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-13 Risk factors and comorbidities resulting in adverse outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mortality,Vaccines,Outcome,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16521"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patrick J.

The intervention that has a far-reaching impact is a global vaccination campaign with the currently available and highly effective COVID-19 vaccines. Unfortunately, cancer patients are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, they tend to experience a higher rate of morbidity and mortality than the general population. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in a cohort of rural veterans with cancer in the ArkLATX.<br \/>Methods: A cohort of 361 consecutive veterans across 5 Hematology-Oncology clinics were included in this study. An in-person survey was conducted asking the veterans whether they received the COVID-19 vaccine; if so, whether they had any reactions to it; whether they had any COVID-19 infections; and if they were vaccinated whether the infection was pre- or post- vaccination. They were also asked to determine the severity of their infection and their reactions to the vaccine when applicable. Age, sex, and race were captured for each participant. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and X<sup>2 <\/sup>and logistic regression were carried out to determine the impact of factors on the outcome and the significance of differences found between the studied subgroups.<br \/>Results: The cohort consisted of 361 veterans, 303 vaccinated and 58 unvaccinated. The mean ages were 69 and 65 years, respectively. Among the vaccinated, 30% experienced vaccine adverse events, but only 2% reported it as severe. While there were more whites in the unvaccinated, there was no difference by sex. Only 2% of the vaccinated reported post-vaccine COVID19 infections versus 22% of the unvaccinated. One and 2 patients reported severe COVID19 infection in the vaccinated and unvaccinated subgroups, respectively. There was one patient who had a severe COVID19 infection before and after. The absolute and relative risk reduction for COVID19 vaccines were 20% and 91%, respectively. The number of patients needed to vaccinate to prevent one adverse outcome was 5.<br \/>Conclusions: The current mRNA vaccines showed 91% efficacy at preventing COVID-19 infections in this high-risk rural veteran patient population with cancer. Aside from primarily mild transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified by our patients. This real-life patient-reported outcome study confirms the efficacy and safety of COVID19 vaccines found in the general population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f0f27ecd-8188-4a45-9ada-bae615f4c41b\/@w03B8ZCD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-15 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Vaccines,Prevention,Cohort study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16524"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Philip A.

Vaccine effectiveness wanes with time and varies by vaccine type. Moreover, current vaccines are based on the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence, and emerging viral variants evade vaccine induced immunity. Booster doses partially overcome these issues, but there are limited clinical data on the durability of protection afforded by boosters - especially against SARS-CoV-2 variants.<br \/>Methods: Here we describe a mechanistic mathematical model for vaccination-induced immunity in patients with cancer and use it to predict vaccine effectiveness taking into account current and possible future viral, host and vaccine characteristics. Crucially, this allows predictions over time frames currently not reported in the clinical literature. The model incorporates the infection of lung epithelium by SARS-CoV-2, the response of innate and adaptive immune cells to infection, the production of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, the activation of the coagulation cascade. The model further accounts for the interactions between the virus, immune cells and tumor cells as well as for vaccination-induced immunity and anti-cancer therapies.<br \/>Results: Model predictions were validated with available clinical data. The model predicts that for healthy individuals vaccinated and boosted with mRNA-1273, BNT-162b2a, and Ad26.COV2.S, robust immunogenicity against the ancestral and delta variant extends beyond a year. Immunogenicity is enhanced following booster vaccination in patients with cancer on various anti-cancer therapies and for patients without cancer on immunosuppressive agents. However, our model predicts that more than one booster dose will be required for patients with cancer, or on immunosuppression, to maintain protective immunity against current and hypothetical future variants. SARS-CoV2 variants with enhanced binding to target cells, reduced affinity for vaccine-generated antibodies or reduced immunogenicity resulted in lower antibody levels and more severe disease compared with variants with enhanced viral replication or internalization rates.<br \/>Conclusion: For patients with cancer and immunosuppressed individuals, SARS-CoV2 variants with enhanced ability to bind to target cells, altered antibody affinity or reduced immunogenicity could lead to breakthrough infections even after a single booster dose. Our mathematical model is useful for anticipating and planning future vaccinations in patients with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8399090e-d2e2-458d-8c87-9a8a42f8060e\/@w03B8ZCD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-06 COVID-19 vaccines and immune responses among cancer patients,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Systems biology,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21046"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chrysovalantis Voutouri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>C.
