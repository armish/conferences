[{"Abstract":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the hardest medical challenge in the world. Nab-paclitaxel is significantly more effective chemotherapy drugs than paclitaxel formulated as Cremophor EL. In this study, we reported the immune effect of Abraxane to combine with our new design recombinant human IL-15 fused with albumin binding domain (hIL-15-ABD) on subcutaneously Panc02 and orthotopically KPC PDAC animal models. In our results, the combination treatment greatly reduced the subcutaneous tumor growth in Panc02 and KPC bearing models, compared with vehicle group. Furthermore, the combinational therapy successfully buildup the anticancer immunity microenvironment (TME) through increasing the activation of effector cells, such as of NK cells (CD3<sup>-<\/sup>\/CD49b<sup>+<\/sup>\/NK1.1<sup>+<\/sup>) and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>\/IFN-&#947;<sup>+<\/sup>\/IL-2<sup>+<\/sup>) cells. Moreover, combination therapy may also decrease the accumulation of immunosuppressvie cells such as MDSCs (CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>\/Gr-1<sup>+<\/sup>)<sup> <\/sup>and Tregs (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD25<sup>+<\/sup>\/Foxp3<sup>+<\/sup>). The combination of Abraxane and hIL-15-ABD were also reduced the NF-&#954;B-mediated immunosuppressive markers, including IDO, Foxp3 and VEGF. In conclusion, Abraxane combined with hIL-15-ABD enhanced immue effector cells involved in both innate and adaptive immunities, reduced the TME&#8217;s immunosuppressive cells, and displayed superior inhibitory effect on both subcutaneous and orthotopic syngeneic murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models than that of either monotherapy. These results suggest that combinational therapy of Abraxane and hIL-15-ABD could be a promising treatment stratedgy for PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/664cfd45-9167-43a6-afa5-5f7ecc7ba2f8\/@v03B8ZQ7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Paclitaxel,Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17484"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Po-Fu Yueh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei-Ting Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keng-Li Lan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Due to their unique physico-chemical properties, they can be used for multimodal cancer therapy (including hyperthermia), diagnostics, and targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules. To enhance the tumor-homing properties of nanoparticles the latter were conjugated with bioligands (i.e., monoclonal antibodies, Fab-fragments, peptides, and proteins such serine protease granzyme B) that recognize 72 kDa membrane-bound heat shock protein (mHsp70) that is expressed on the plasma membrane of tumor cells, including multiforme glioblastoma (GBM), but not on normal corresponding cells. Therapeutic potential of magnetic conjugates can be attenuated by binding to the particles surface of granzyme B (GrB-SPIONs) that exerts pro-apoptotic activity. Functionalized particles significantly contrast-enhanced the orthotopic glioblastoma (U87 glioma in NMRI nu\/nu mice, GL261 glioma in C57\/Bl6 mice) in preclinical animal models when high-field (11 ) magnetic resonance tomography (Bruker) was employed. Furthermore, when GrB-SPIONs were applied, we detected a statistically significant delay of tumor progression and increase of overall animal survival. Anti-tumor activity of GrB-SPIONs was further synergistically potentiated by stereotactic radiotherapy combined with immune check-point inhibitors (i.e., CTLA-4). In conclusion, synthesized superparamagnetic nanoparticles targeting mHsp70-positive could be employed for theranostics of malignant brain tumors and translated into further clinical trials.This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Agreement &#8470; 075-15-2020-901).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f3dec473-0c40-4467-9f05-b9129932e8d1\/@v03B8ZQ7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Heat shock proteins,Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ,Hsp70,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17485"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ruslana Tagaeva<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vyacheslav Fedorov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalia Yudintceva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luidmila Yakovleva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boris Nikolaev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Osnach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxim Shevtsov<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is a very heterogeneous tumor with different levels of aggressiveness. Despite the multiple therapeutic strategies (i.e. aggressive chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy), the outcome in advanced stages or recurrent diseases is negative. New strategies are needed to improve the therapeutic efficacy of existing drugs and reduce their toxicity. Nanotechnology represents a good tool for reaching this goal. Taken this in mind, the focus of this experimental work was to engineer polymeric biodegradable nanomedicines for co-delivering anti-inflammatory and chemotherapeutic molecules to NB malignant masses. More specifically, the work focused on the synthesis, physico-chemical and biopharmaceutical characterization, <i>in vitro<\/i> testing and <i>in vivo<\/i> validation of nanomedicines loaded with the cytotoxic drug Docetaxel (DTXL) and the natural anti-inflammatory compound, Curcumin (CURC).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Four configurations of Spherical Polymeric Nanoparticles (SPNs) - loaded with CURC (CURC-SPNs), loaded with DTXL (DTXL-SPNs), loaded with the combination thereof (CURC\/DTXL-SPNs), and empty (SPNs) - were synthesized using an oil-in water emulsion\/solvent evaporation technique. SPNs size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured by dynamic light scattering. The toxicity of SPNs was determined by an MTT assay on the human NB cell line SH-SY5Y. For <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy and biodistribution experiments, homozygous CD1 nu\/nu athymic female mice (4 to 6-weeks old) were orthotopically injected with SH-SY5Y cells in the left adrenal gland.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Empty, DTXL-SPNs, CURC-SPNs, and CURC\/DTXL-SPNs were characterized by a narrow size distribution (PdI &#60; 0.15) with an average hydrodynamic diameter of about 185 nm. All the formulations showed a negative surface &#950;-potential, associated with the carboxylate groups in the DSPE-PEG coating. A biphasic release profile was observed for all the 3 formulations, with almost 90% of the total drug mass released within the first 24 hours. <i>In vivo <\/i>results indicated that mice treated with CURC\/DTXL -SPNs had a significant increase in life span as compared to untreated mice (control) (p=0.0002), mice treated with CURC-SPNs (p=0.0205), DTXL-SPNs (p=0.0391), and free DTXL (p=0.0054). Biodistribution experiments showed a 2% ID\/g accumulation of the injected dose per tumor mass, regardless of the tumor development stage. This behavior is in agreement with results from a longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging analysis of the malignant masses.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The obtained results would suggest that nanomedicines could effectively delivery two therapeutic molecules within the malignant mass and modulate its progression leading to a significant increase in overall survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Neuroblastoma,Synergism,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17486"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Agnese Fragassi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Di Francesco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabio Pastorino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miguel Ferreira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Di Francesco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Lisa Palange<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Celia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luisa Di Marzio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Cilli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Bensa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mirco Ponzoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo Decuzzi<\/i><\/presenter>.

The redundancy and complexity of molecular pathways in cancer create a need for multiplexed targeting that can be achieved with multiplexed siRNA delivery. Here we delivered multiplexed siRNA with a PSMA-targeted biocompatible dextran nanoparticle (NP) to downregulate CD46 and PD-L1 siRNA in PSMA expressing prostate cancer cells. The multiplexed gene targets selected, PD-L1 and CD46, play important roles in the escape of cancer cells from immune surveillance. PSMA is abundantly expressed by prostate cancer cells allowing prostate cancer specific delivery of the NPs. The NP was decorated with acid cleavable amine functional groups through acetal bonds that undergo degradation under acidic conditions providing rapid release of siRNA. Cell imaging and flow cytometry studies confirmed PSMA-specific delivery of CD46 and PD-L1 siRNA to high PSMA expressing PC-3 PIP cells. Immunoblot, qRT-PCR and flow cytometry confirmed downregulation of CD46 and PD-L1 following treatment with multiplexed siRNA at a concentration of 50 nM.

These were injected peri-tumorally to generate a local vasoconstrictive effect intended to &#8220;entrap&#8221; intratumorally injected melphalan. Drug exposure\/dwell time was measured with fluorescent imaging. Mice bearing B16 (subclone F10) melanoma tumors were treated with intratumoral melphalan (20 ug\/50 ul) with or without peri-tumoral liposomal phenylephrine (10 ug\/50-100 ul x 4-5 injections around the tumor periphery) twice weekly x 3 weeks.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> UV-Absorbance spectroscopy confirmed encapsulation of phenylephrine within the liposomal nanoparticles with an expected absorbance of 275 nm. The modified ethanol injection method produced liposomal phenylephrine encapsulation of approximately 25%. Peri-tumoral, liposomal phenylephrine caused vasoconstriction of normal surrounding vessels with an approximate 10% decrease in vessel diameter. Our liposomal phenylephrine nanoparticles also led to increased retention of intratumorally injected fluorescently-labeled (FITC) liposomes 24-48 hours after inoculation, using both melanoma (B16) and breast (TUBO\/4T1) cell lines orthotopically grown within mice (C57Bl\/6 and BALB\/c, respectively). The combination of intratumoral melphalan with peri-tumoral phenylephrine resulted in more effective control of tumor growth and a complete tumor response rate of 44.4%, compared to phenylephrine\/melphalan only controls (p &#60; 0.01, n=18 per group). However, there was significant adverse reaction with the combination therapy, resulting in ulceration of the injection\/tumor site. Ulcers healed about 14 days after completion of treatment. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased infiltration of CD11b+ cells into the tumors, suggesting an immune-mediated response in addition to direct chemotoxicity.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> Liposomal nanoparticles containing phenylephrine increased retention\/dwell time of intratumorally administered melphalan and resulted in superior anti-tumor response.

Patients with GC suffer from a low 5-y survival rate due to the lack of effective treatments. Based on the genomic and molecular characteristics of GC, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) classified GC into four molecular subtypes: microsatellite-instable (MSI), Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV), chromosomal-instable (CIN), and genomically stable (GS). CIN tumors usually occur at gastroesophageal junction and normally belong to intestinal type of Lauren classification, which are characterized by DNA anueploidy, abnormal chromosomal copy numbers, and the frequent mutation of gene TP53, leading to chromosomal instability. CIN represents the most prevalent GC subtype (&#62;50%) with a poor prognosis, highlighting a significant and unmet medical need for developing effective CIN-targeted therapeutics. \u0009Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of targeted therapeutics, composed of a humanized monoclonal antibody and small molecular cytotoxic drugs via chemical linkers. In this study, we designed and engineered a novel ADC targeting chromosome instable gastric cancer (CINGC). We first explored intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) as a novel molecular target for CINGC by characterizing its overexpression levels in a panel of human GINGC cell lines. ICAM1 is a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein with functions of regulating cell-cell adhesion, signaling, and transendothelial migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. Many malignant tumors including GC were found to aberrantly overexpress ICAM1 on the surfaces of tumor cells. The high overexpression of ICAM1 on CINGC cells was validated by using flow cytometry (FCM) quantitatively and immunofluorescence (IF) staining qualitatively. To correlate it with clinically relevant GC tumor tissues, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of ICAM1 was then conducted to determine the high expression of tumor tissue compared with para cancer tissue. The antigen-mediated endocytosis of ICAM1 monoclonal antibody was further detected by FCM quantitatively and IF visually. All the results showed that ICAM1 was an promising molecular target for CINGC, therefore, it was selected to engineer CINGC-targeted ADCs. We engineered a panel of ADC formulations with different linkers and cytotoxic payloads. We identified an optimal ADC formulation for CINGC by screening their cytotoxicity against CINGC cells <i>in vitro<\/i> in comparison with first line chemodrugs including 5-FU and oxaliplatin, which efficacy was validated by measuring its inhibitory activity on tumor growth, progression and metastasis via CINGC xenograft models. In conclusion, a novel ICAM1 ADC was designed and engineered to selectively recognize and ablate CINGC cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our engineered new ADC offers the possibility of improving the clinical outcome and life quality of CINGC patients and expanding the scope of clinical use of drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b4cf8a33-789d-49ed-af8c-d67d4c2d2f40\/@w03B8ZQ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Chromosomal instability,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18446"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xinyan Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoqing Guan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shili Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bing Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chun Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tong Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiangjiang Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangdong Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Among all types of cancers, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortalities in the United States. Non-small cell lung cancer is one of the dominant divisions of lung cancer that solely represents 85-90% of all lung cancer cases. Up to the present time, primary treatment regimens for this cancer include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, with chemotherapy being the best option thus far. Despite the eminent benefits of chemotherapy, its value is offset by severe side effects such as renal and\/or hepatic toxicity or insufficient amounts of drug available at the target site. Such pitfalls can be handled by employing natural compounds (polyphenols, phytochemicals, xanthonoid, etc.,) as chemopreventives or chemosensitizers which can improve chemotherapy activity while reducing its systemic side effects and drug resistance. To this end, our recent efforts demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic benefit of gambogic acid (GA) and gemcitabine (Gem) against lung cancer. However, simultaneous delivery of these two drugs at the tumor site is highly challenging. Therefore, development of an injectable nanoformulation that can effectively deliver both hydrophobic (GA) and hydrophilic (Gem) drugs in one formulation is a clinically unmet need.<br \/><b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b> Pursuing the novel nanotherapy approach, our lab has developed an <i>in-situ<\/i> biodegradable and biocompatible human serum albumin (HSA) and tannic acid (TA) mediated complexed GA and Gem nanoparticles (G-G@HTA NPs) using the solvent evaporation method. G-G@HTA NPs formation was confirmed by particle size, FT-IR, and H-NMR. A superior therapeutic activity of G-G@HTA NPs was demonstrated by multiple <i>in vitro<\/i> functional assays as well as in an animal mouse model.<br \/><b><u>Results:<\/u><\/b> Our results confirmed that G-G@HTA NPs have the ideal particle size and surface charge for cancer cell\/tissue delivery which can clearly be evident by preferential uptake of these nanoparticles in lung cancer cells. Further, G-G@HTA NPs superiorly inhibited cell proliferation and clonogenicity of NSCLC cells. Additionally, G-G@HTA NPs revealed an obvious and precise targeting of tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>. The promoted and more synergistic anti-tumor efficacy of G-G@HTA NPs was attained than that of combined treatments and single drugs treatments. These events were resulted with no apparent systemic and organ toxicities.<br \/><b><u>Conclusion:<\/u><\/b> In summary, this study details the design of a novel nanocarrier and provides an optimized strategy for constructing dual-loaded nanoparticles using a biodegradable, non-toxic, human serum albumin-tannic acid-based platform for GA and Gem co-delivery in the treatment of NSCLC which confirms a strong feasibility to implement such synergistic nanomedicine regimen in pre-clinical and clinical translations in future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58a36fb6-54d6-4022-817c-daf87b7cd555\/@w03B8ZQ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Drug delivery,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18447"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Elham Hatami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prashanth K.

Conventional treatment strategies for lymphoma are effective, but face a multitude of challenges limiting efficacy. Nanomedicine presents a viable option to optimize the efficacy of current anti-lymphoma therapies. To achieve most selective drug targeting, optimization of liposome preparations is key. To improve the selective targeting properties of conventional liposomes, cell membrane lipid-extracted nanoliposomes (CLENs) were prepared using lipids extracted from lymphoma target cells. Reported here is results of initial design and development, including physicochemical characterization and in vitro analyses.<br \/>Methods: The CRL-1593.2 cell line was the chosen cellular model of lymphoma. CRL-1593.2 cells were cultured and expanded In vitro for cellular extraction purposes. The CRL-1593.2 cell lipid extract (LE) was included to prepare CRL-1593.2 CLENs. Conventional lipid ingredients used in preparation of CRL-1593.2-CLENs included DOPC, Cholesterol, and DPPE-Rhodamine (used as a fluorescence indicator) for fluorescence studies using a fluorescence microplate reader. Phase I studies included physicochemical characterization and cellular uptake studies of preparations of CLENs, including 0 to 40 mol% of CRL-1593.2 LE content. In Phase II, the optimal LE content as determined by Phase I was fixed, while cholesterol content varied from 0 to 40 mol%.. For in vitro studies, the control cell lines employed represented other hematological diseases, RPMI 8226 (multiple myeloma), CCRF-CEM (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and K562-GFP (chronic myeloid leukemia).<br \/>Results: The optimized composition of CLEN preparation type consisted of DOPC: Cholesterol, lymphoma lipid extract (derived from CRL-1593.2 cells) in the ratio of 93:5:2. The mean particle size was 116 &#177; 10 nm (n=4) and the mean zeta potential was - 4.5 &#177; 5 mV (n= 4). For in vitro studies, the inclusion of 2 mol% LE in CRL-1593.2-CLENS demonstrated significant uptake when compared to 0% LE control preparations (P = 0.016). Additionally, the lymphoma cells also had a significantly higher uptake of the CRL-1593.2-CLENs when compared to the other hematological cell lines [(CCL-155; P = 0.0081), (K562-GFP; P = 0.0037) and, (CCRF-CEM; P = 0.0079)].<br \/>Conclusions: Early findings collectively suggest that the CRL-1593.2-CLENs is a highly selective drug delivery platform for the targeting of lymphoma cells.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/65312e5c-d1e3-433b-9799-495eedf25dc3\/@w03B8ZQ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,Liposomes,Drug delivery,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18448"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joyce Edlyne Chima Bom<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tien Van Le<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tracy Togba-Bass<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erica Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Campbell<\/i><\/presenter>.

There is a great need to develop new strategies to improve the outcome of this disease. PBI-05204, a supercritical CO<sub>2<\/sub> <i>Nerium oleander<\/i> extract containing cardiac glycosides, such as oleandrin, has been tested in Phase I and II clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of PBI-05204 against GBM and to explore potential mechanisms of action. Rapid growth of GBM has been associated with the presence of pluripotent cancer stem cells that have the capacity of self-renewal, proliferation, and formation of cancer progenitor cells. Genome wide expression profiling of Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) demonstrates similarities to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and progenitor cells defining a pattern of hierarchical appearance of Embryonic stem cell markers: NANOG, SOX2, and GFAP. Using cultures of patient derived GSCs: GBM9 expressing WT EGFR and EGFRVIII, and GS28 expressing EGFR WT, we found that PBI-05204 treatment at concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 2.5 &#956;g\/ml for 72 hr significantly inhibited the number of tumor spheres by 59.8, 73.2, and 92.3% in GBM9 GSC, and 47.9, 81.6, and 93.4% in GS28 GSC, respectively. The size of the spheres in PBI-05204 (1 &#956;g\/ml) treated GBM9 GSC (103.3 &#177; 17.5 &#956;m) was also significantly smaller than that of the control group (277.5 &#177; 10.9 &#956;M, p &#60; 0.01). PBI-05204 treatment significantly inhibited protein expressions of ESCs and progenitor cell markers NANOG, SOX2, and GFAP in a conc-dependent manner in GBM9 and GS28 GSCs as determined by Western blot analyses. NANOG is a transcription factor implicated in the pluripotency of ESCs in various cancers including GBM. Previously it has been shown that the Hedge Hog and Gli axis (HH -Gli) is important for GBM growth, stem cell expansion and establishment of an ESC signature. Western blot analysis showed PBI-05204 down-regulated the expression of Gli1 in both GBM9 and GS 28 GSC after 24 hr. of treatment suggesting it inhibits the Shh-Gli1-NANOG axis. Determination of the antitumor efficacy of PBI-05204 in a GSC derived mouse orthotopic tumor model is currently ongoing and the result will be presented at the meeting. Given that the active components of PBI-05204 have the capacity to readily cross the blood-brain barrier, our findings suggest that this novel botanical drug is a viable candidate that should be considered for treatment of GBM due to its ability to inhibit the stemness of GBM independent of highly resistant EGFR\/EGFR VIII mark.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a370d6f-3d37-4707-82ba-564a716f5e98\/@w03B8ZQ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Stemness,Gli1,PBI-05204,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18449"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sharmistha Chakraborty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daoyan Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Peiying Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The current study evaluated the potential of AZD9574, a next generation, PARP1 selective inhibitor\/trapper, to penetrate the CNS in cynomolgus monkey, and its occupancy of the PARP1 enzyme, using positron emission tomography (PET). In vitro bidirectional efflux assay data suggested AZD9574 showed minimal substrate potential compared to the clinically approved PARP inhibitors. This was reflected in an increased ratio of unbound brain to unbound plasma concentration (Kp<sub>uu<\/sub>) in the rat of ~0.31. Therefore AZD9574 was taken forward into cynomolgus monkey PET studies. Firstly, the Kp<sub>uu<\/sub> was determined following dosing of [<sup>11<\/sup>C]AZD9574, co-administered with unlabeled drug to minimize the impact of specific binding. The high specific signal observed lead to the development of [<sup>11<\/sup>C]AZ3391, a PARP1 selective, CNS penetrant PET tracer, which was subsequently used to directly assess the PARP1 target engagement of AZD9574 in the brain. AZD9574 was found to show a Kp<sub>uu<\/sub> in cynomolgus monkeys of 0.79, close to unity with unbound plasma concentrations suggesting minimal CNS restriction. Furthermore, an i.v. infusion dose response study with AZD9574, conducted to examine its ability to block target occupancy by the PET tracer [<sup>11<\/sup>C]AZ3391, demonstrated a reduction in [<sup>11<\/sup>C]AZ3391 accumulation in whole brain. The resulting calculated occupancy of AZD9574 ranged from 17% for the lowest dose (0.003 mg\/kg) to 95% for the highest dose tested (0.05 mg\/kg). Comparable reduction in occupancy was seen for peripheral tissue, such as bone marrow, supporting the conclusion that AZD9574 shows minimal CNS restriction. These data show that AZD9574 is the first PARP inhibitor to reach the clinic which combines PARP1 selectivity, trapping and high CNS penetration in a single molecule and supports its development as a potential therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease and primary brain tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/62097c69-3c82-4dc7-baf5-afb8894dd4a6\/@w03B8ZQ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-10 Synthesis, metabolism, and disposition,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,PET,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Biodistribution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18450"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andy Pike<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amber Balazs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zsolt Cselényi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sébastien L.

A large percentage of cervical cancer patients will develop advanced diseases (stage IV or recurrent disease) and the 5-year survival rate of these patients was only 15-20% due to the lack of efficacy and adverse effects of first line chemodrugs. Recently, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) emerge as a novel class of targeted therapeutics that selectively ablate tumor cells without damaging normal organs and tissues, which has shown promising efficacy in treating solid tumors. In this study, we sought to develop a cervical cancer-targeted ADC using a novel molecular target.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Firstly, human cervical cancer and paracancerous tissue were stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in order to determine the difference of the expression level of a molecular target. Three human cervical cancer cell lines (C-33A, Si-Ha and Ca-Ski) and one normal cervical cell line (HCerEpiC) were used to determine the subcellular location of an ADC target on the cells by immunofluorescence (IF) staining, flow cytometry and single photon confocal microscopy. Secondly, endocytosis capability of target antibodies was visualized by confocal imaging and was quantified by flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, a panel of ADC formulations with different chemical linkers and payloads were designed, constructed and characterized as ADC candidates for cervical cancer therapy. We next evaluated<i> in vitro<\/i> inhibitory activity of these ADC candidates on three cervical cancer cell lines by CCK8 assay. Finally, orthotopic and lung metastasis animal models of cervical cancer were established to determine the <i>in vivo<\/i> inhibitory activity and biosafety of constructed ADC candidates.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>IHC staining of clinical specimens showed that the expression level of CD54 in cervical tumor tissues was significantly higher than those of paracancerous tissues. Fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry further determined the overexpression level, plasma membrane location and antigen-mediated endocytosis activity of CD54 in multiple human cervical cancer cell lines. Among several ADC formulations, an optimized CD54-targeted ADC linker and warhead combination was identified by comparing its IC50 with other ADC candidates and standard-of-care chemodrugs for cervical cancer. The optimized CD54 ADC exhibited promising anti-tumor activity on primary and lung metastatic cervical tumor models.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In our study, we identified CD54 as a novel ADC target for cervical cancer. An optimized CD54-targeted ADC formulation was determined and its anti-tumor activity and biosafety profile were determined in multiple human cervical cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and orthotopic and lung metastatic cervical tumor models <i>in vivo<\/i>, providing a promising targeted therapeutic candidate for the targeted treatment of cervical cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b5f41c66-9088-4720-b3ef-1bf2a04be86d\/@w03B8ZQ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Therapeutic target,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19007"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shili Yao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bing Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tong Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huarong Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Highly invasive and asymptomatic characteristics of CCA cause most patients diagnosed at advanced stages, severely deteriorating their clinical outcomes. The drug treatment options for CCA are limited and surgical resection of CCA frequently suffers from a high recurrence rate of 66%. Albeit Pemigatinib, a FGFR2 inhibitor, has recently been approved by FDA as the first CCA-targeted therapeutic, only less than 10% of patients with CCA carry FGFR2 fusion mutations that can benefit from this drug. Ivosidenib, another targeted drug against IDH1 mutation, only works for 13% CCA patients carrying this mutation. Therefore, discovering new molecular targets and developing associated targeted drugs remain a significant and unmet medical need in CCA therapy. In this study, we first screened potential molecular targets for CCA by comparing the expression levels of a panel of cancer-related cell membrane antigens between human CCA cells and normal human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells through flow cytometry. CD54 was identified as a remarkable molecular target of CCA with strong binding force to its antibodies and high endocytosis efficiency by flow cytometry and confocal fluorescent microscopy. Meanwhile, we confirmed that CD54 was absent in most normal human tissues but was highly upregulated in CCA tumor tissues through immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Based on this newly discovered CCA target, we constructed a series of CD54 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) using different chemical linkers and payloads. We next evaluated and compared the half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of each ADC in ablating human CCA cells <i>in vitro<\/i> in order to identify an optimized ADC formulation. Furthermore, we validated its anti-tumor efficacy against primary and peritoneal metastatic CCA tumors <i>in vivo<\/i> in comparison with conventional chemotherapy. Eventually, we determined the biodistribution and safety profile of this CD54 ADC in order to ensure that it is well-tolerated under the effective dose. In general, we identified CD54 as a novel molecular target for CCA through antibody library screening, and explored its potential in the development of CCA-targeted ADCs, providing a promising targeted therapeutic for clinical treatment of CCA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/328b7a96-494f-4327-8b7d-af1c6d8d7346\/@w03B8ZQ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Gastrointestinal cancers: other,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19008"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bing Zhu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shi-Li Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin-Yan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie-Er Ying<\/i><\/presenter>.

All known clinical PARP1 inhibitors bind at the same site at the catalytic center of the enzyme. However, despite this resemblance they show immensely different outcomes in terms of response rate in the clinic due to their varying degree of PARP trapping ability. Moreover, the first-generation PARP inhibitors were not optimized for selectivity across the PARP family potentially driving undesirable side effects, including intestinal toxicity from tankyrase inhibition or hematological toxicity from PARP2 inhibition. There has been strong rationale for the use of PARP inhibitors in neuro-oncology. However, the first-generation PARP inhibitors have limited CNS distribution as these drugs were not designed for brain penetration. Recently AstraZeneca has reported the discovery of AZD5305, a next generation PARP1 selective inhibitor and PARP1-DNA trapper which was not designed with a CNS penetrant profile. Given the unmet need of a brain penetrant PARP1 inhibitor, we set out to identify a highly potent and selective PARP1 inhibitor and trapper with CNS profile. In our next generation PARP1 inhibitor, we sought to retain the profile of AZD5305 and lower the efflux for CNS penetration. Despite the challenge of narrow SAR, we successfully used the structure- and property-based design approach to identify a brain penetrant PARP1 inhibitor and PARP1-DNA trapper. We used multiple medicinal chemistry maneuvers such as masking the hydrogen bond donors and core modifications to lower the efflux in order to achieve brain penetration. Further optimization of the nicotinamide mimetic core for potency and metabolic stability led us to the discovery of AZD9574.AZD9574 shows improved selectivity for PARP1 over PARP2 vs AZD5305 and retains its excellent selectivity over other PARP family members. It has low efflux in Caco2, MDCK-MDR1, and MDCK-MDR1-BCRP permeability assays and it also showed CNS penetration in rat and cynomolgus monkey. AZD9574 has excellent secondary pharmacology and acceptable physicochemical properties and good PK in preclinical species.<i>In vitro<\/i>, AZD9574 selectively inhibits the growth of BRCAm cell lines. Importantly, AZD9574 showed efficacy in an intracranial BRCA1m MDA-MB-436 xenograft model at doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg\/kg QD, significantly extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice compared to vehicle control arm.In summary, AZD9574 is a next generation selective PARP1 inhibitor and trapper with CNS penetration. This profile makes it an ideal candidate for treating CNS malignancies or brain metastases that have a dependence on PARP inhibition either as single agent or in combination with other therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/12447753-d584-4e50-9ae8-9aa1d29335c4\/@w03B8ZQ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,BRCA1,Blood-brain barrier,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21182"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Avipsa Ghosh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sudhir M.

Despite progress in development of novel therapies for the treatment of GBM, it remains largely incurable with a poor prognosis and a very low life expectancy. Recent studies have shown that oleandrin, a unique cardiac glycoside from <i>Nerium oleander,<\/i> as well as defined extract (PBI-05204) that contains this molecule, inhibit growth of human glioblastoma, and modulate glioblastoma patient-derived stem cell-renewal properties. The present study aimed to investigate the radiosensitization of PBI-05204 in glioblastoma using both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> cancer models as well as to explore the potential mechanism of actions in GBM. The radiosensitizing effect of PBI-05204 was assessed against human GBM U87MG, U251, T98G and A172 cell lines as well as their relevant xenograft and orthotopic models. The induction of apoptosis, DNA damage and repair of DNA double strand breaks were assessed with determination of caspase 3 and 9 protein expression, DNA laddering, protein expression of rH2AX, Ku70, DNA-PKcs, and RAD51 as well as a Comet Assay. PBI-05204 treatment leads to an increased <i>in vitro<\/i> sensitivity of GBM cells, including U87MG, U251, T98G and A172 cells, to radiotherapy (RT) in which the main mechanisms are the transition from autophagy to apoptosis and enhanced DNA damage evidenced by increased expression of &#947;H2AX. Additionally, relative increased expression of Ku70, DNA-PKcs and RAD51 due to RT were reduced by PBI-05204 in U87MG and U251 cells, suggesting PBI-05204 lessened RT mediated DNA repair. PBI-05204 significantly enhanced the RT mediated inhibition of tumor growth by 4.7-, 2.1- and 2.2-fold in U87MG, U251 and T98G xenograft models, respectively. The combination of RT and PBI-05204 showed a significantly enhancement of disease-free survival to 103.0 &#177; 63.2 days compared to the control group (p &#60; 0.001) which was 3-fold longer than that of RT only group. Collectively, these results reveal that PBI-05204 enhances antitumor activity of RT in preclinical\/murine models of human GBM. Given the fact that PBI-05204 has already been examined in Phase I and II clinical trials for cancer patients, its efficacy when combined with standard-of-care radiotherapy regimens in GBM should be explored in future clinical trials of this difficult to treat brain cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed9dcb06-6fbe-485d-8d17-6866ad0418ff\/@w03B8ZQ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,DNA double-strand break,Radiosensitization,PBI-05204,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21189"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Alessandro Colapietro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Peiying Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandra Rosetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Mancini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Flora Vital<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefano Martellucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Marampon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincenzo Mattei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Luca Gravina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Newman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudio Festuccia<\/i><\/presenter>.

KRAS functions as a small GTPase that cycles through its GTP-loaded &#8220;on&#8221; state and its GDP-loaded &#8220;off&#8221; state, a highly regulated process that is crucial for normal cell proliferation and survival. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS1 plays a critical role in this process by regulating the &#8220;on\/off&#8221; state of KRAS. The protein-protein interaction between SOS1 and KRAS facilitates turnover of KRAS from the GDP-loaded inactive state to its activated and GTP-loaded state, a critical step to enable productive KRAS effector binding and activation of downstream signaling. The KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor, adagrasib (MRTX849), irreversibly binds to the GDP-loaded inactive conformation of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> and has recently shown encouraging clinical activity across several cancer types. As adagrasib binds preferentially to the inactive state of KRAS, blockade of SOS1 is anticipated to shift KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> into the adagrasib-susceptible GDP-loaded state. Furthermore, this combination strategy could be used to target other mutant-driven cancers within the MAPK pathway using the appropriate KRAS<sup>mut<\/sup> inhibitors and\/or inhibitors of other targets within the MAPK pathway including MEK or EGFR. MRTX0902 was identified using iterative structure-based design as a selective inhibitor of SOS1 that demonstrates an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 2 nM in a SOS1 HTRF binding assay and 30 nM in an MKN1 cellular assay. In pharmacokinetic evaluation across species, MRTX0902 demonstrated low extraction ratios and moderate to high bioavailability in mice, rats, and dogs. In preclinical models, MRTX0902 augmented the antitumor activity of adagrasib and other selected therapies. The design, discovery, and preclinical characterization of the potential best-in-class candidate MRTX0902 will be described.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d8111df0-983b-4458-8c2a-1e9d5395753c\/@o03B8ZQ9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Protein-protein interactions,SOS1,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19991"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John M.

It accounts for 10-20% of breast cancers, appears in younger women, metastasizes fast, and is associated with poor prognosis and poor patient survival. There are no available tailored therapies for TNBC to date. One of the ways to treat TNBC is by targeting its metastasis feature. With-no-lysine kinase 1 (WNK1), which is known to interact with diverse signaling pathways including ion homeostasis, has been recently identified as one of 6 driver genes in a murine TNBC model. Published and preliminary data support the premise that WNK1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion in TNBC. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of WNK1 blocks metastasis in a TNBC mouse model. Given the existence of four WNK isoforms in which kinase domains are 90% identical, developing a clinically available WNK1-specific inhibitor is an unmet need. We identified WNK1-selective inhibitors by a High Throughput Screen (HTS) of over 200,000 structurally diverse small molecules. A class of quinoline-derived compounds showed high specificity and potency for WNK1. A combination of molecular modeling, crystallography, and synthesis-based strategies were employed to improve the potency of compounds. Interestingly, the compound SC107-01 reported below 100 nM IC<sub>50<\/sub> for WNK1 by <i>in vitro<\/i> assays. Also, it shows higher specificity for WNK1 over other kinases as evident by kinome-specificity profiling. We had previously crystallized the kinase domain of WNK1. The structure revealed its unique active site. Co-crystal structure of SC107-01 with WNK1 shows that the inhibitor binds to the WNKs&#8217; specific active site and forms a unique set of interactions. Further modifications to the SC107-01 are underway to improve bioavailability and efficacy. <i>In vivo <\/i>toxicology and drug pharmacokinetics will be conducted in mouse models. We anticipate that this work will lay the foundation for developing a small molecule that inhibits WNK1 to combat metastasis in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fe33acba-bc1b-4167-abd3-ae157f4858d6\/@o03B8ZQ9\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Metastasis,High Throughput Screening (HTS),Co-crystal structure,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20376"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ashari Rashmi Kannangara<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julita Chlebowicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Radha Akella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie H.
