[{"Abstract":"ICT3205 is a targeted cytotoxic agent, comprised of an MT1-MMP-specific peptide and a paclitaxel warhead. Paclitaxel, originally approved in 1992, is one of the most commonly used chemotherapies for various cancer types, but is often characterized by its dose-limiting toxicity and low aqueous solubility. Tumor-targeted prodrugs are a promising strategy for the selective delivery of taxanes to prostate tumors, especially given the results of STAMPEDE trial<sup>1<\/sup>. Previous work has shown that ICT3205 is selectively metabolized in tumor tissue over the normal tissue, and that this is specifically mediated by MT1-MMP<sup>2<\/sup>. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies have demonstrated that when administered at an equimolar dose to paclitaxel, ICT3205 has a superior anticancer effect, with an absence of systemic toxicity. In this study we aim to further investigate the cellular uptake and metabolism of ICT3205 and other taxane analogues in MT1-MMP +ve (HT1080) and MT1-MMP -ve (MCF-7) cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. The compound will be also studied in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, since it has been demonstrated before that there is a good correlation between MT1-MMP protein and mRNA expression. ICT3205 and analogues have been synthesized, and purified by semi-preparative HPLC. We report the tumor-specific metabolism of ICT3205 in prostate tumors <i>ex vivo<\/i>, and we are currently studying its cellular uptake and metabolism in MT1-MMP +ve and MT1-MMP -ve cancer cell-lines using HPLC, mass spectrometry and immunofluorescent microscopy. Moreover, <i>ex vivo<\/i> metabolism studies are performed on the analogues, while they will be also assessed for their metabolism and cellular uptake. These data will provide a better understanding of the mechanism of uptake and metabolism of this type of peptide prodrugs, and will provide the basis for the future synthesis and optimization of these prodrugs.<br \/>1.James ND et al.

The CBFA2T3-GLIS2 oncogenic fusion that is seen exclusively in infants and young children &#60;3 years is the most refractory AML with near uniform mortality with conventional therapies. As part of our Target Pediatric AML (TpAML) discovery effort to define novel therapeutic targets, we discovered folate receptor alpha (FR&#945;, FOLR1) transcript to be expressed in CBF-GLIS positive AML and verified cell surface expression of FOLR1 on leukemic cells. We present pre-clinical efficacy of a novel FOLR1 directed therapy (ELU001) in CBF-GLIS AML.ELU001 is a novel ~6 nm-diameter FOLR1-targeted C&#8217;Dot-Drug-Conjugate (CDC) incorporating ~21 exatecan molecules as a payload that is designed to treat cancers with improved safety and efficacy as compared to antibody-drug conjugates. A Phase 1 clinical trial of ELU001 in adult patients with tumors that overexpress FOLR1 is currently underway (NCT05001282). In this study, we determined the potential utility of ELU001 for CBFA2T3-GLIS2 AML by evaluating its preclinical efficacy in AML models. We confirmed the binding of ELU001 to AML cells expressing FOLR1 by flow cytometry using MV4;11 AML cell line transduced with an FOLR1 expression construct (MV4;11 FOLR1+). We show that MV4;11 FOLR1+ cells readily bind to ELU001 but not MV4;11 parental cells. Consistent with target-dependent binding, <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that MV4;11 FOLR1+ cells were highly susceptible to ELU001 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=30 pM) while MV4;11 parental cells were only minimally affected by treatment. To evaluate <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy, we transplanted MV4;11 FOLR1+ cells transduced with Luciferase-expression construct into immune deficient NSG mice at 1M cells per mouse and treated the mice the following week with different doses of ELU001 (vehicle, 0.3mg\/kg Q3Dx6, 0.5 mg\/kg Q3Dx3, and 0.65mg\/kg Q3Dx3). Leukemia burden was assessed by whole-body bioluminescence (IVIS) imaging, performed weekly. IVIS imaging showed that ELU001 effectively eradicated the leukemia <i>in vivo<\/i>at all three doses tested resulting in enhanced survival while mice that received the vehicle treatment exhibited disease progression and eventually succumb to the disease. We confirmed that the leukemia was absent in ELU001-treated mice at the study endpoint of 120 days post treatment by flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow, spleen and liver tissues harvested at necropsy. ELU001 was well tolerated with an apparent maximum tolerance dose of 1.50 mg\/kg\/mouse (0.5 mg\/kg exatecan, Q3DX3). In summary, we demonstrated that ELU001 is highly effective at eliminating FOLR1 positive AML cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, providing the preclinical data to support further assessment of ELU001 in clinical trials for pediatric patients with CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusions overexpressing FOLR1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/94b82ae1-7dca-4341-964e-db424f5c6aa8\/@v03B8ZE2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Acute myeloid leukemia,Preclinical,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12253"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Quy Le<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Thao Tang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cynthia Nourigat McKay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melik Turker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Gardinier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vaibhav Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aranapakam Venkatesan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tin Khor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory P.

Here TH1902, a peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) which consists of two molecules of docetaxel attached by a cleavable succinyl linker to a peptide (TH19P01) that targets the scavenger receptor sortilin (SORT1), was investigated using subcutaneous implantation of murine B16-F10 melanoma cells within the flanks of syngeneic C57BL\/6 mice. Tumor growth was at most inhibited by half upon weekly administration of docetaxel compared to vehicle-treated mice, while administration of TH1902 was well tolerated and led to tumor regression. The B16-F10 SORT1-expressing melanoma cell line is also known to produce distant lung metastases when injected intravenously into the mice. Tail vein injection of these cells (1.25x10<sup>5<\/sup> cells per implantation) created a model system for evaluating TH1902&#8217;s effects on metastatic nodules formation. Each implantation produced 70 to 100 visible, black surface nodules on the lungs at 13 days following cancer cell implantation, appropriate for nodule quantification. No black nodules were detected elsewhere within the mice tissues other than those detected in the lungs. This model was next used to demonstrate that the formation of lung metastases could be sharply curtailed by bi-weekly intravenous administration of either 10 mg\/kg docetaxel or 23 mg\/kg TH1902 (equivalent to the docetaxel injection in terms of docetaxel content) during this period. Administration of docetaxel routinely decreased the number of metastatic lung nodules by about 50%, whereas administration of TH1902 decreased the number of nodules by more than 85%. Similar results were obtained whether the test articles were administered <i>i)<\/i> one time as a bolus at one hour prior to implantation of the cells, <i>ii)<\/i> as a bolus twice weekly beginning 3 days post-implantation, or <i>iii)<\/i> both prior to and following implantation as described. Although little weight loss was recorded over the 13-day treatment duration, all TH1902-treated mice showed better tolerability profile in terms of weight compared to docetaxel for all conditions tested. In a subsequent experiment using prolonged administration at the same dosage (up to 24 days of treatment), TH1902 was able to inhibit metastatic formation over a longer period compared to docetaxel. In fact, after six cycles of treatment, TH1902-treated mice significantly sustained its inhibitory effect on melanoma lungs metastasis formation (-77%) whereas docetaxel was unable to maintain its effect (&#8209;7%). Moreover, considerable weight loss was associated with docetaxel treatment over 24 days while TH1902 treatments resulted in no net change in mouse body weights. In this syngeneic model, TH1902 is more tolerated and effective than docetaxel at inhibiting both melanoma xenograft growth and metastatic formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2351b3c4-6f5b-4ed4-ab44-a7abf6cd5eeb\/@v03B8ZE2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Metastasis,Xenografts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12254"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michel Demeule<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Christophe Currie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cyndia Charfi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Larocque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Zgheib<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Kozelko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Béliveau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Marsolais<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Borhane Annabi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Ultra-small (sub-10nm) C&#8217;Dot-drug-conjugates (CDCs) directly address this, exhibiting deep penetration and retention in solid tumor models, with limited systemic exposure following rapid renal clearance. CDCs can also achieve greater potency by delivering over 10x more payload and by binding to tumor cells with a higher avidity allowing effective killing of tumors with broader range of moderate to high expression of target antigens. ELU001 is a CDC that targets folate receptor alpha (FR&#945;) overexpressing tumors via folic acid moieties on its surface and delivers an average of 21 exatecan topoisomerase-1 inhibitor molecules as its payload. FR&#945; is overexpressed on a variety of tumors including ovarian, endometrial, triple negative breast and non-small cell lung, but is minimally expressed on normal tissues making it an attractive tumor-associated antigen for targeted drug delivery. ELU001 is highly stable in plasma and elicits antitumor efficacy in a variety of cell line and PDX-derived tumor models both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In 15-day repeat dose toxicology and toxicokinetic studies performed in Wistar Han rats and Beagle dogs, ELU001 was well tolerated at up to 0.87 mg\/kg\/day in rats and 0.174 mg\/kg\/day in dogs based upon conjugated exatecan concentration when administered on a QWx3 schedule via a 1-hour infusion. Observed dose-related toxicities for both species were limited to the bone marrow and GI tract - the same organs as those observed when free payload (exatecan) was administered suggesting that the delivery of exatecan conjugated to the CDC did not broaden the tissue toxicity profile. Observed toxicities were recovered or substantially reduced by the end of a two-week recovery period. No drug-related hepatic, renal, pulmonary or ocular toxicities were observed and there were no drug-related deaths in the repeat dose toxicity study. TK parameters, estimated in the 15-day GLP studies revealed similar plasma exposure values in males and females for ELU001, Total Exatecan (conjugated and released) and Released Exatecan for rats and dogs, respectively. ELU001 exhibited an average circulatory half-life ranging from approximately 15 to 20 hrs in rats and 24 to 29 hrs in dogs with no accumulation of ELU001, Total Exatecan or Free Exatecan observed from day 1 to day 15. Based upon AUC<sub>0-last<\/sub> (hr*ng\/ml) released payload levels in the circulation were less than approximately 0.3% and 0.1% of the total payload levels in the rat and the dog respectively. No ELU001 anti-drug antibodies were induced in either species.

One strategy to achieve greater selectivity and better anticancer drug delivery into cancer cells is to conjugate cytotoxic agents to specific peptide ligands that selectively target receptors abundantly expressed on these cells. Increased expression of sortilin (SORT1), a scavenging receptor, has been shown to be highly expressed in many cancers, including ovarian and endometrial cancers. The peptide-drug conjugate TH1902 (a peptide which targets SORT1 and is <i>bis<\/i>-linked to two docetaxel molecules) was investigated to determine whether it could be efficacious against SORT1-positive ovarian (ES-2, A-2780 and SKOV-3) and endometrial (AN3-CA) cancer models. The Alexa488-fluorescent peptide used to generate TH1902 was transported into ES-2 and SKOV-3 cells by a process requiring clathrin-coated vesicles, and which was strongly diminished by siRNA-mediated SORT1 silencing or by competition with SORT1 ligands. <i>In vitro<\/i>, TH1902 enabled an increase in apoptosis of over 2-fold compared to that of unconjugated docetaxel. The effects of TH1902 administration were also examined in multiple subcutaneous xenograft tumor models (ES-2, SKOV-3, A-2780 or AN3-CA cells). Following two weeks treatment at equivalent docetaxel doses, the ES-2 xenograft sizes in mice treated with vehicle or with docetaxel were statistically indistinguishable but there was a significant decrease in tumor size by 78% for mice treated with TH1902. In SKOV-3 xenografts, treatment with either drug both stopped tumor growth and induced similar tumor regressions. In AN3-CA xenografts, treatments administered at equivalent docetaxel maximum tolerated dose (MTD) induced similar initial tumor regressions. However, TH1902-treated mice showed prolonged tumors regression whereas tumors started to regrow upon docetaxel treatment interruption. At one quarter of the docetaxel MTD, TH1902 significantly inhibited AN3-CA tumor growth whereas docetaxel had minimal effect (-73% vs -11%, respectively). Mice bearing A-2780 xenograft tumors were treated with TH1902, paclitaxel or docetaxel alone, as well as with each in combination with carboplatin. Comparison of the tumor sizes between the various treatments showed that TH1902 alone caused stronger A-2780 tumor growth inhibition than did either of the unconjugated taxanes or carboplatin. Moreover, TH1902 combined with carboplatin also demonstrated better efficacy than did either of the taxane-carboplatin combinations. Overall, the results indicate that TH1902 possesses an <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy superior to those of docetaxel against ovarian and endometrial cancers in the animal models tested, and that TH1902 could be safely combined with carboplatin to reach optimal inhibition of tumor growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4be345e0-8572-4c5c-ba8e-d74637e78922\/@v03B8ZE2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Ovarian cancer,Endometrial cancer,Xenografts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12259"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christian Marsolais<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michel Demeule<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cyndia Charfi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Christophe Currie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Larocque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Zgheib<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Béliveau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Borhane Annabi<\/i><\/presenter>.

In recent years, mRNA has been successfully utilized preclinically to deliver cytokines to tumors locally at efficacious doses.<br \/>Versameb has developed a technology platform which enables combinatorial approaches for intra-tumoral application of nucleotide therapeutics that comprise an mRNA element covalently linked to up to three independent siRNA elements targeting various tumor-relevant genes. Such constructs allow a dose-synchronized treatment of different components in parallel, which opens the opportunity to address up to four cancer targets within a single RNA molecule.<br \/>For proof of concept, we designed a combinatory molecule consisting of mRNA coding for human interleukin 2 (IL-2) linked to a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Transfection of A549 adenocarcinoma cells led to dose-dependent secretion of efficacious concentrations of IL-2 and simultaneous complete VEGFA knockdown. IL-2 protein functionality was tested in SK-OV-3 cell spheroids co-cultured with human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). After treatment, secreted IL-2 protein induced immune cell activation and consecutive spheroid killing by PBMCs from three independent donors. VEGFA functionality was tested in an <i>in vitro<\/i> vascularization assay in HUVEC cells. Cells were treated with supernatants of vehicle or RNA transfected SCC-4 head &#38; neck cancer cells producing high endogenous VEGFA, and vascular sprouting was analyzed quantitatively. While vehicle-treated cell supernatant induced vessel sprouting, supernatant from RNA treated cells showed much reduced sprouting <i>in vitro<\/i> consistent with the lower VEGFA levels measured, confirming functionality of the siRNA effect on VEGFA protein expression.<br \/>We further provide examples of combinatory molecules targeting up to 4 independent key cancer hallmarks and their functional outcomes in various cancer cell types.<br \/>In conclusion, mRNA combination constructs can be developed into cancer therapeutics that target several pro-tumorigenic pathways simultaneously with a single molecule overcoming hurdles of delivery, toxicity, and regulatory requirements for combination therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/abed77a8-801f-4aa6-8d1b-6e2b2844f3c6\/@v03B8ZE2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mRNA,siRNA,Combination therapy,Interleukin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12265"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Petra Hillmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin A.

The high mortality rates are linked to the development of resistance to first line chemotherapy with platinum compounds. Currently there is no standard second-line treatment for platinum resistant ovarian cancer (OCpt). Resistance to platinum-based therapy has been attributed in part to increased activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The anti-diabetic drug metformin was previously shown to induce cytotoxicity in OCpt cells and the combination of a FAK inhibitor, Y15 and metformin may be a promising treatment for OCpt. Oftentimes, drugs have a short half-life which results in low bioavailability at the target site of interests. Biomaterial scaffolds can be utilized to deliver drugs locally to maximize the drug concentration and bioactivity at the target site while minimizing non-target systemic exposure and toxicity. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is an &#945;-hydroxy acid-derived polyester copolymer that has a variety of biomaterial applications due to its great biocompatibility and versatility. The degradation rate of PLGA can be easily tailored from days to years providing versatility in the delivery of different drugs. PLGA scaffolds can be fabricated using a mold-less technique that provides controlled release of drugs from such scaffolds. The objective of this study was to utilize biomaterials as a dual drug delivery system and investigate if the combined delivery of both Y15 and Metformin, would result in synergistic effects on cell viability compared to the release of each drug alone. We also evaluated if controlled release of the drugs could be achieved using the scaffolds. To evaluate this, PLGA scaffolds were fabricated from an easy and economical mold-less technique by combining PLGA and the drugs (i.e. metformin and\/or Y15) in tetraglycol and injected in PBS, to form a globular scaffold. An MTT assay was used to analyze cell viability in platinum resistant OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells at an absorbance of 570 nm with a microplate reader. Drug release from the scaffolds were determined in PBS using a microplate reader at absorbance wavelengths of 233 and 380 nm for Metformin and Y15, respectively. Metformin and Y15 treatment reduced cell viability by 34 and 46%, respectively. In combination, both drugs reduced cell viability by 76%. In studies with the fabricated PLGA scaffolds, Y15 and metformin single treatments reduced cell viability by 36% and 11% respectively. However, when the drugs were combined, there was a 95% reduction in cell viability. Furthermore, the delivery of the drugs from the PLGA scaffolds resulted in a sustained release. In conclusion, the delivery of Y15 and Metformin in a biomaterial scaffold can result in controlled released of the drugs and a synergistic effect on cell viability and thus, can be further explored as promising approach for the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b261b669-09e9-4240-abb2-0fc0799e2677\/@v03B8ZE2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metformin,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Combination therapy,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12258"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emily M.

A challenge for this class of agents is the requirement for cell surface expressed tumor specific targets, as a large number of tumor-specific antigens are only expressed intracellularly. One strategy to access these targets is to take advantage of the natural processing and presentation of intracellular antigens in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, this requires the development of therapeutics that can be active against targets with a very low surface density. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of Flex<i>bodies<\/i>, a novel format bispecific antibody engineered to target MHC-peptide tumor neoantigens. We demonstrate that the orientation of the targeting arms and the valency of these reagents allow specific T-cell activation and potent cytotoxic activity against cell lines expressing endogenous level of peptide antigens. This bispecific format has the potential to become an important new tool to expand the range of tumors able to be specifically targeted with t-cell redirecting biologics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a90ec442-4cb0-4a01-b413-5f34fe8b7a6d\/@w03B8ZE3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Peptides,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12264"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lauric Haber<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan McKay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Finney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Castaneda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Spitler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sahar Rizvi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aidan Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Bray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Willy Ramos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pamela Krueger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Delfino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Craig Meagher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tammy Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Olson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Smith<\/i><\/presenter>.

FOLR1 is overexpressed in many cancers with unmet medical need, including ovarian, lung, and breast cancers, while normal tissue expression is limited. PRO1184 is comprised of a 1) human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to FOLR1, 2) a cleavable, hydrophilic linker, and 3) exatecan, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor. Upon binding to FOLR1 on the surface of malignant cells, PRO1184 is internalized and exatecan released through enzymatic cleavage of the linker. Exatecan blocks the ligation step of the cell cycle and generates DNA single- and double-strand breaks, which leads to cell death. The mechanism of action and clinical potential of PRO1184 was tested in a series of studies. PRO1184 bound selectively and specifically to FOLR1 with nM affinity. PRO1184 was efficiently internalized and demonstrated cytotoxicity against multiple cell lines, in vitro. In mouse carcinoma models, PRO1184 demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor types that represent ovarian, non-small cell lung, and breast cancer. In addition, PRO1184 was more potent with greater tumor growth inhibition than that of a DM4-conjugated ADC. PRO1184 was tolerated at the 60 mg\/kg dose level in cynomolgus monkeys and the safety profile was generally more favorable than that for a DXd-based ADC. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of PRO1184 were similar to that of the unconjugated parent antibody in rats. PRO1184 has the potential for a meaningful therapeutic window to provide an appropriate benefit to risk profile for patients with FOLR1-expressing cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c19ccbab-b6ea-471c-a78c-057171c79982\/@w03B8ZE3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Folate receptor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12260"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Baiteng Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Wang II<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haidong Liu III<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suping Huang IV<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Shang V<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Han VI<\/i><\/presenter>.

Current standard therapy is relatively ineffective for relapsed and metastatic Ewing sarcoma predominantly due to development of resistance to chemotherapeutics. Nanoparticle-formulated drugs are reported to increase uptake into tumor tissue, while reducing drug access to normal tissues, because of reduced permeability of normal vasculature. This potentially leads to lower dose exposure in normal tissues and reduced toxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antitumor activity of the PEGylated poly(ADP) ribose polymerase 1\/2 (PARP1\/2) inhibitor talazoparib combined with the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) in Ewing sarcoma xenograft models and other pediatric cancers.<br \/>Method:. We evaluated the preclinical efficacy of PEGylated talazoparib (PEG~TLZ), alone or in combination with TMZ, in Ewing sarcoma and glioblastoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. Additional solid tumor models, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, malignant rhabdoid tumor, osteosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma were evaluated using a novel single mouse testing approach. PEG~TLZ was administered as a single administration intraperitoneally to mice bearing subcutaneous tumors at a single dose of 5 - 20 &#181;mol\/kg alone, or at 10 &#181;mol\/kg on day 1 combined with TMZ administered orally at 40 mg\/kg starting on day 3 or 4 for 5 consecutive days.<br \/>Results: Mice bearing Ewing sarcoma and MGMT-deficient glioblastoma xenografts tolerated PEG~TLZ+TMZ with minimal toxicity and achieved maintained complete response (MCR). The time-separated drug administration schedule of the single dose of PEG~TLZ followed by the 5-day TMZ treatment demonstrated objective responses in Ewing sarcoma, rhabdoid tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and glioblastoma PDX models.<br \/>Conclusion: We evaluated the range of PEG~TLZ+TMZ activity among pediatric solid tumor panels using conventional and single-mouse testing approaches, and demonstrated that PEG~TLZ combined with delayed TMZ administration enhances the therapeutic window of the treatment compared to free TLZ. From the clinical standpoint, the single intravenous administration of PEG~TLZ could be advantageous for treating infants and young children.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7a7f33bf-0512-4648-8afd-34ccefe22b84\/@w03B8ZE3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Ewing sarcoma,Preclinical testing,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12268"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Vanessa Del Pozo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew J.

In particular, blockade of the PD-L1\/PD-1 axis with PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies has achieved successful and durable treatment outcomes in some patients across a variety of cancer types. However, primary or acquired resistance to immunotherapy and adverse effects have been observed in cancer patients, due to a hostile TME and the immunosuppressive activity of various inhibitory checkpoint receptors and their ligands on immune cells and cancer cells. It was recently reported that dual blockade of PD-1\/PD-L1 and TIGIT\/CD155 could improve treatment efficacy in NSCLC patients. We therefore develop bispecific antibody against both PD-L1 and TIGIT with the aim of enhancing the efficacy of therapy and mitigating potential adverse effects.<br \/>Methods: We obtained TIGIT binders by VHH library panning, and constructed PD-L1\/TIGIT BsAbs of two different structures either by fusing the TIGIT VHH to a PD-L1 IgG or by fusing the TIGIT VHH to a PD-L1 VHH-Fc. TIGIT binding and CD155 blocking was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using Jurkat cells stably expressing TIGIT. Function assays were conducted with a co-culture system of H1975 stably expressing OKT3 and induced human exhausted T cells or luciferase reporter Jurkat cells with high expression of PD-1 and TIGIT.<br \/>Results: Both bispecific antibodies effectively bind TIGIT on T cells and PD-L1 on PD-L1 positive cancer cells. Interaction between BsAb and the two targets bridge the T cell and the cancer cell and result in the clustering of the antibody-antigen complexes at the contact area of the two cells. Functionally, GB265 antibodies effectively blocked CD155 and PD-1 signal pathways in the cell-based reporter system and exhibited ADCC function specifically to target cancer cells.<br \/>Conclusion: GB265 antibodies have the potential to outperform PD-L1 and TIGIT monospecific antibodies or their combinations in rejuvenating anti-tumor immunity in cancer patients due to its bridging activity and dual blockade function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7588bd26-6d2a-4a46-a03e-a0166ae5157a\/@w03B8ZE3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Lung cancer: non-small cell,TIGIT,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21561"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Su Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riyao Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cai Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saroja Putrevu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan S.

Synthetic long peptides require endogenous processing by antigen presenting cells to be presented to T cells, thus reducing the risk of antigen presentation by non-professional antigen presenting cells lacking co-stimulation receptors. The formulation and delivery strategies require further development as peptides degrade rapidly <i>in vivo<\/i>. Herein we make use of a novel targeting and adjuvant strategy to deliver peptides to antigen presenting cells. Tumor-derived peptides are coupled to a B cell epitope element (the MTTE sequence, a tetanus toxin-derived universal B cell epitope) which induce the formation of peptide-conjugate -complex formation in vivo. This strategy, further named the TET technology, makes use of pre-existing antibodies to improve the bioavailability, stability, and immunogenicity of tumor-derived peptide therapeutics. The TET technology is here used in TENDU, a first-in-class prostate cancer vaccine candidate. TENDU incorporates selected immunogenic prostate cancer epitopes derived from PAP and PSMA. The peptides are designed to include proteasome processing elements along with a unique TAP translocation element. To assess the design, a conjugate with a known DR4 epitope embedded in a longer peptide was evaluated for T cell priming in HLA-DR4 animals and displayed T cell expansion in response to a prime\/boost vaccination. To ensure that prostate cancer patients respond with antibodies to the MTTE sequence after a tetanus toxoid (TTd) vaccination, both healthy controls and patients (age and gender matched) were vaccinated using a TTd-based vaccine regime. Anti-MTTE antibody titers were evaluated. Patients and HCs responded with increased IgG1 type antibodies against MTTE after TTd vaccination. Safety with regards to hypersensitivity in response to the vaccine platform was evaluated in rabbits and a human whole blood loop system without any identified adverse events. Based on preclinical data the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was set to 1440&#181;g\/dose. The vaccine is currently assessed in a First-in-Human clinical study (TENDU-101, 3+3 study design) in patients with relapse after a primary radical prostatectomy. No safety concerns were noted at the lowest dose level and the 400 &#181;g dose cohort has been initiated with the first patient dosed with no reported adverse events. The study&#8217;s primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints involve cellular immune responses, systemic PSA and PAP levels along with dose level selection. In conclusion, TENDU, a first-in-class vaccine candidate is under clinical development evaluating safety and tolerability for the TET vaccine platform technology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/05c95eed-6a12-4cc8-8122-3c88b25a3d6d\/@w03B8ZE3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Immunotherapy,Vaccines,Peptides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21414"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Erika Fletcher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iliana Kerzeli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Cordfunke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aikaterini Nasi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gunilla Törnqvist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Valentijn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frida Lindqvist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inken Dillmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Lord<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neanke Bouwman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacques Neefjes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natasja Dolezal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kees Franken<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie McArdle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murrium Ahmad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Johansson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ferry Ossendorp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Haggman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wolfgang Lilleby<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gustav Ullenhag<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Ladjevardi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justyna Jarblad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Wouter Drijfhout<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sara Mangsbo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
