[{"Abstract":"DNA repair is the process by which cells identify and correct mutations present within the genome. These correction mechanisms maintain genomic stability and prevent the development of cancer. The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway identifies and corrects small insertions, deletions, and misincorporations that arise within the genome as a result of errors during DNA replication. The process by which MMR corrects these mispairs includes recognition of the mispair by the MutS complex, recruitment of the MutL complex to the mutation site, excision of the mispair, and gap filling by DNA polymerase. MMR is also critical for inducing apoptosis after chemically induced mispairs, such as those from alkylating agents. Exonuclease 1 is the protein responsible for the excision step of MMR. However, MMR can occur in the absence of Exo-1. Thus, MMR can be separated into two subpathways: Exo1-dependent MMR and Exo1-independent MMR. In Exo1-dependent MMR Exo-1 binds to both the MutS complex and MutL complex. The MutL interaction is facilitated by an MLH1 interaction peptide (MIP) box. We recently identified a Msh2 interaction peptide (SHIP) box in yeast Exo1. This project aims to understand how MIP and putative human SHIP box motifs influence human Exo1 recruitment to MMR processes. We have created mutations within the predicted binding domains of human Exo1. We observe changes in localization of Exo1-mutant proteins within the cell, suggesting that changes in the overall MMR process may be present. We also observe changes in MMR-mediated apoptotic response when a subset of Exo1-mutations are expressed in the presence of endogenous wildtype Exo1, indicating a potential for a dominant negative interaction. Our ongoing studies are expected to shed more light upon how the changes in these interactions may affect the human MMR process and overall genomic stability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ee6e2441-334c-4cb4-ada6-35f2a063014b\/@z03B8ZKd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Alkylating agents,Mismatch repair,DNA repair,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13652"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Breanna Knicely<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Currently, there are no treatment strategies based on HPV integration status. We postulate that a conceptual advance in the treatment of HPV HNSCC cancer can be formalized by targeting transcriptional co-regulator - bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins which mediate viral and host transcription. HPV maintenance in the host environment is dependent on BET protein-BRD4. An additional function of BET proteins in regulating transcription of tumor suppressors and DNA damage repair (DDR) genes. Given that patient populations have viral integrations into their genomes and its maintenance depends on cellular Brd4, displacing Brd4 through novel second-generation BET inhibitors can abrogate HPV transcription. Through chemical and knockdown studies of BET proteins in integrated viral HNSCC cells, we show viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are directly regulated by Brd4, reactivate tumor suppressors p53, release E2F1-Rb cell cycle brake to induce G1 cell cycle arrest, and significantly converge towards downregulation of DDR pathways in disrupted viral genomes. In contrast, non-disrupted viral genomes diverge from DDR pathways towards downregulation of interferon signaling pathways. As a result of the intrinsic genomic instability caused by the downregulation of components of the DDR machinery, the addition of external beam radiation further delayed DNA repair kinetics quantified through H2AX foci formation in cells harboring disrupted viral genomes. Taken together, targeting BET proteins is not a viable monotherapy but creates genomic instability, which, when combined with radiation, has the potential to eradicate HPV-associated tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BET inhibitors,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13655"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Aakarsha Rao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zijian Ni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albert Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhruthi Suresh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chitrasen Mohanty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Kendziorski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gopal Iyer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

These unmet needs, despite recent advances, are leading researchers to identify novel targets to develop next-generation therapeutics. Considerable evidence from the published reports and TCGA database analysis indicates that CRM1, which functions as a nuclear export protein, amplifies prostate cancer, resulting in dysregulated nuclear export machinery. This dysregulation is also seen to correlate with mislocalization of p53, FOXO-1, and 3a, cyclinD1, p16, p21, and p27 in prostate cancer. Besides these mislocalized proteins, key DNA repair pathway members such as BRCA1 and Rad51 exhibit a nuclear export signal (NES) and are putative CRM1 cargoes. Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of these repair proteins may play an essential role in repairing damaged DNA. We hypothesize that inhibition of CRM1 would result in defective DNA repair through disruption of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of important repair protein cargoes.<br \/>Methods: PCa cells (both AR-positive and negative lines) were treated with Selinexor to estimate the subtoxic doses. Cell lysates and total mRNA were collected to evaluate the relative levels of BRCA-1, RAD51, p53, ATM, ATR transcripts, and proteins. Activation of the DNA damage pathway was measured through a phosphorylated form of these proteins, and functional assessment of homologous recombination(HR) was measured through an HR sensor plasmid construct.<br \/>Results: Treatment of PCa cells with Selinexor affected expression, localization, and kinetics of DNA repair leading to unrepaired DNA and induced apoptosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/24d43e39-dc79-4de0-9934-31af2e47cba1\/@z03B8ZKd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,DNA repair,CRM1,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13658"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rajendra Kumar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janet Mendonca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kavya Boyapati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuhan Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deven Topiwala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suthicha Kanacharoen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keerti Soundappan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lillian Wilson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eleni Panagopoulos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Carducci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sushant K.

Mechanisms by which these genomic events occur during the lifespan of a neoplasm have yet to be fully delineated. In our study we identified a novel function for APOBEC3A (A3A), a primate-specific cytidine deaminase upregulated in multiple cancers including Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), in the initiation of CIN.We demonstrate that A3A is not routinely detected in non-diseased pancreata; however, expression was detected in the epithelial and stromal compartments from patients with chronic pancreatitis and in precursor lesions of PDAC and is further significantly increased in invasive neoplasia. Strikingly, we found that A3A expression but not A3A-induced mutagenesis, was associated with a significantly reduced overall survival in PDAC. By employing a variety of genetic tools, we identified a novel function for A3A in initiating CIN, underscoring its potential role in driving the observed early metastatic propensity in PDAC. Using a series of <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> models, we demonstrate that A3A-induced CIN leads to aggressive cancer, featuring enhanced, STING-dependent, distant organ seeding and metastatic growth. As a consequence of aberrant A3A function and CIN-mediated upregulation of STING, NfkB and Stat3 pathways were activated. <i>More importantly, all these effects were independent of the deaminase domain, underscoring a novel role of A3A beyond its established canonical function.<\/i> Remarkably, in a novel autochthonous murine model of PDA expressing human A3A, we identified numerous copy number changes, homologous to those altered in A3A overexpressing patient tumors, including deletions in DNA repair pathway genes. While we showed that A3A-expressing PDAC cells do not fully phenocopy a BRCA mutation-like phenotype, A3A-expressing PDAC cells are exceptionally sensitive to PARP inhibition and DNA cross linking agents, recapitulating a state of &#8220;chemical BRCAness&#8221;. The combined effect of deletions in these genes has yet to be ascertained, and we hypothesize that these losses further add to ongoing DNA damage overall in PDAC. In summary, our study shows, that A3A drives metastasis and specific deletions through a deaminase-independent initiation of CIN, with potential implications for targeted treatment strategies in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0e1080a7-61b2-471a-9352-1a4b39b79ed9\/@z03B8ZKd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Genomic instability,DNA damage,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13659"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sonja Maria Woermann<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fredrik I.

MAA are younger at diagnosis, have higher tumor volume at diagnosis and have higher tumor aggression compared to European American men. Additionally, genomic profiling continues to show that PCa etiology and phenotype are influenced by higher amounts of African ancestry and that West African ancestry is associated with unique genomic alterations. Herein we utilize whole exome sequencing of a unique cohort of 45 advanced stage, treatment na&#239;ve Nigerian&nbsp;primary PCa tumors and 11 unmatched non-tumor tissue to compare genomic variants with African (AA) and European (EA) American TCGA PCa tumors. Nigerian samples were collected from 6 sites in central and southwest Nigeria. After whole exome sequencing, samples were processed using GATK best practices. Four genes [BRCA1 (100%), BARD1 (45%), BRCA2 (27%) and PMS2 (18%)] had germline variants in at least two Nigerian non-tumor samples. Across 111 germline variants, the AA cohort reflected a pattern [BRCA1 (68%), BARD1 (34%), BRCA2 (28%) and PMS2 (16%)] similar to Nigerian samples. Of the most frequently mutated genes, BRCA1 showed a statistically (p &#8804; 0.05) higher mutation frequency in MAA. Disaggregating gene level mutation frequencies by variant revealed both ancestry linked and Nigerian specific germline variant patterns. Driven by rs799917, BRCA1 showed increasing mutation frequency as African admixture increased. BRCA2_rs11571831 was only present in MAA and BRCA2_rs766173 was increased in Nigerian men. 133 somatic variants were present in 26 PCa associated genes within the Nigerian tumor cohort. Nine genes [BRCA2 (27%), APC (20%), ATM (20%), BRCA1 (13%), DNAJC6 (13%), EGFR (13%), MAD1L1 (13%), MLH1 (11%) and PMS2 (11%)] showed mutation frequencies above 10%. Compared to TCGA cohorts, BRCA2, APC and BRCA1 showed statistically significant increases in Nigerian tumors. The Nigerian cohort variant pattern shared similarities (cosign similarities &#8805; 0.734) with COSMIC signatures 5 and 6 and mutated genes showed significant (q &#60; 0.001) GO and functional enrichment in mismatch repair and non-homologous repair deficiency (HRD) pathways.

Moreover, we identify variants of unknown significance that may contribute to population specific routes of tumorigenesis and treatment.

However, the underlying mechanisms of this mutagenesis and its functional and genetic determinants remain poorly understood. Somatic regional mutagenesis is known to correlate with DNA replication timing and chromatin accessibility; however, these studies have used epigenetic information from common cell lines while the epigenomes of primary human cancers remain uncharacterized in this context.<br \/>Here we model megabase-scale mutation frequencies of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in thousands of whole cancer genomes using hundreds of genome-wide profiles of chromatin accessibility and replication timing spanning primary cancer samples, normal tissues, and cell lines. Using a machine learning framework, we show that CA profiles of primary cancers, rather than those of normal cells, predict regional mutagenesis and single base substitution (SBS) signatures in most cancer types. Thus the majority of passenger mutations follow the epigenetic landscapes of transformed cells of matching cancer sites and tissues.<br \/>Mutational signatures associated with carcinogen exposure, as well as signatures of unknown origin, show the strongest associations with epigenomes while associations with endogenous signatures are weaker. In most cases, overall mutation burden and SBS signatures inversely correlate with chromatin accessibility, however certain signatures are instead enriched in chromatin-accessible elements.<br \/>Lastly, the genomic regions with excess mutations unexplained by the epigenetic profiles in our models likely represent a combination of localized mutagenesis and positive selection of functional oncogenic mutations. Our computational models highlight an enrichment of known driver mutations, point out novel intergenic regions with putative non-coding drivers, and indicate an over-representation of developmental and lineage-specific genes in these frequently mutated genomic regions.<br \/>These results characterize the complex interplay of mutational processes, genome function, and somatic evolution in cancer and its tissues of origin, and also outline strategies for distinguishing driver and passenger mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30041d59-1e4e-49c2-ac7b-6eec07dcb5bc\/@A03B8ZKe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Mechanisms of genomic alterations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutagenesis,Cancer genomics,Epigenomics,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13662"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jüri Reimand<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Ocsenas<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have previously demo started that ATR inhibition is associated with anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical models of soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) (Laroche et al., 2020). We decided to investigate the mechanisms of resistance to ATR inhibition in sarcomas.<br \/>Methods: We used a CRISPRa was to identify genes that mediate resistance to AZD6738 in STS cells. The anti-tumor activity of AZD6738 (ATR inhibitor) and AZD0156 (ATM inhibitor) was investigated in a panel for 10 STS cell lines and two patient-derived xenografts (PDX) established at Institut Bergoni&#233; (Bordeaux, France).<br \/>Results: We used a CRISPR approach in a STS cell line resistant to AZD6738 and we made a negative-selection screen, to identify genes whose silencing conferred sensitivity to low doses of ATR inhibition. Among these genes, we identified <i>THRAP3<\/i> which encodes a protein phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and primarily by ATR. THRAP3 is involved in the maturation and further export of transcripts encoding the ATM and its depletion results in deficient processing of transcripts encoding the ATM kinase. We validate the result of our CRISPR analysis by demonstrating that selective THRAP3 inhibition reduce significantly ATRi IC50. Given the role of role of THRAP3 on the regulation of ATM activity, we decided to investigate the potential synergy between ATR and ATM inhibition in vivo and in vitro. AZD6738 and AZD0156 displayed a synergistic or additive effect in above all the STS cell lines tested. We noted that ATRi treatment reduced phosphorylation of the ATR kinase target CHK1 but increased ATM phosphorylation, suggesting that ATM pathway takes over for DNA Damage Response and cells survival. In contrast, both ATR and ATM pathway were inhibited when AZD6738 and AZD0156 were used in combination, as shown by reduction of CHK1 and ATM phosphorylation. We validated our in vitro results in an <i>in vivo <\/i>model of liposarcoma xenograft in which AZD6738 and AZD0156 had synergistic anti-tumor activity.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study demonstrates synthetically lethal interactions between ATM and ATR in<i> vitro<\/i> and <i>in <\/i>vivo.

A small percentage of patients that develop persistent infection with oncogenic HPV show an increased risk of developing an HPV-associated malignancy. Head and neck, oropharyngeal cancer is related to the persistent infection by high-risk HPV type 16, E6\/E7 oncoproteins. The E6\/E7 oncoproteins significantly contribute to the carcinogenic genomic instability effect of high-risk HPV through the degradation of two proteins, p53 and pRB, respectively. The human oropharynx often harbors anaerobic bacteria that produce a variety of byproducts, including butyrate. Butyrate is a modulator of induced genomic instability, influencing the development of HPV oral cancer when implanted in a syngeneic mouse model. In this study, we investigate butyrate co-treatment with HPV E6\/E7 in vitro. This treatment increased cellular proliferation, DNA double strand breaks, and genetic instability processes associated with apoptosis regulation. These data indicate that in connection with butyrate, HPV E6\/E7 oncoproteins can promote increased upregulation of apoptosis, disrupt cell cycle regulation, and decrease DNA double strand break repair. Epigenetics and chromosomal instability events have been noted, specifically, the deletion of the distal region of chromosome 11q22-23 in E6\/E7 transfected keratinocytes. These results indicate that HPV-16, E6\/E7 oncoproteins plus butyrate treatment can influence genomic changes in mouse keratinocytes, which may further promote oral carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cd40d655-7c4b-446c-922f-2c07b2a7078c\/@A03B8ZKe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Oral cancers,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Genetic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13664"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c1e83c01-41fb-4a48-a7fb-81071d8bf23d","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c1e83c01-41fb-4a48-a7fb-81071d8bf23d\/@A03B8ZKe\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eva McGhee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengtao Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Ling Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brooke Su-Velez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nefertari Carr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chinelo Njubigbo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rohun Sadeghi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matin Sadegh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julian Handler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adin Handler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naomi Long<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Vadgama<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, upon recurrence, many tumors can eventually stop responding to treatment and become resistant to therapy. Therefore, sensitizing cancer cells to therapy is an important approach to increase overall patient survival and improve their quality of life. We have previously shown that targeting the chromatin associated architectural protein High Mobility Group Box 3 (HMGB3) can sensitize cisplatin resistant human ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin. HMGB proteins are non-histone chromatin proteins, which bind to distorted DNA structures with higher affinity compared to double-stranded DNA. HMGB proteins have been shown to play important roles in DNA metabolism, such as replication, transcription and repair. We found that the sensitization of cisplatin resistant human A2780\/CP70 ovarian cancer cells by siRNA-mediated targeting of HMGB3 is achieved, at least in part, by significantly lowering the expression of the DNA damage response (DDR) proteins ATR and CHK1. In addition, depletion of HMGB3 repressed global transcription by ~50% in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells. Here we report that GFP-tagged HMGB3 protein forms distinct foci in human A2780 ovarian cancer cells upon cisplatin treatment. Further, depleting HMGB3 in cisplatin resistant A2780\/CP70 cells reduces the rate of cisplatin-DNA adduct removal, suggesting a possible role in chemoresistance. In addition, mass spectrometry studies reveal that HMGB3 interacts with the cisplatin resistance-associated overexpressed protein (CROP, also known as LUC7L3 ), following treatment with the DNA interstrand crosslink-inducing agent, psoralen (plus UVA irradiation). LUC7L3 is associated with the spliceosome and is overexpressed in A2780\/CP70 cells compared to A2780 ovarian cancer cells. SiRNA-mediated depletion of HMGB3 reduces the transcription levels of LUC7L3. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of LUC7L3 reduced the clone forming capacity of U2OS cells and ovarian cancer cells. Analysis of cancer patient databases revealed that LUC7L3 mRNA is overexpressed in many cancer types including ovarian cancer. Further analysis showed that ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and lung cancer patients overexpressing LUC7L3 have a significantly reduced overall survival than those with lower levels. Taken together, these data indicate that in addition to the architectural roles of HMGB3, which is important for DNA metabolism, transcriptional modulation of DDR proteins through interaction with the spliceosome may be another way that HMGB3 modulates chemotherapeutic DNA damage processing in human cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ed7464f-f880-4f89-8b64-4610cc90e275\/@A03B8ZKe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,DNA repair,Chemoresistance,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13667"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anirban Mukherjee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorraine-Rana Benhamou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen M.

However, resistance to ADT invariably develops, leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Prostate cancer progression is marked by overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and increased <i>de novo<\/i> synthesis of fatty acids. Importantly, the majority of normal tissues have low expression of FASN and rely mostly on exogenous lipids, making FASN an interesting therapeutic target for prostate cancer. Previously our group evaluated the effects of inhibiting FASN in prostate cancer, with especially promising results in CRPC models. We observed that FASN inhibition decreases DNA damage repair capability by transcriptionally modulating homologous recombination (BRCAness) and non-homologous end joining repair pathways, which leads to increased DNA damage and apoptosis. Key enzymes involved in DNA repair pathways are reduced at the protein level, and the addition of exogenous palmitate, the product of FASN, is able to rescue their expression to normal levels. Interestingly, genes involved in the synthesis of ceramide are upregulated after FASN blockade, with consequent increased cellular levels of ceramides, dihydroceramides and sphingomyelin. Additionally, we observed increased acyl chain unsaturation levels in these lipid species, in line with the uptake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) observed when <i>de novo <\/i>lipogenesis is blocked. The inhibition of ceramide synthesis, both through genetic knock-down with siRNA or pharmacologically with an inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, is capable of partially rescuing the DNA damage induced by FASN inhibition, suggesting a role of ceramides in DNA damage response modulation. Next, we investigated the synergistic effect of combining FASN inhibitor with PARP inhibitor and observed a higher inhibition of cell growth in prostate cancer cell lines in comparison to either drug alone. Human CRPC organoids when treated with PARP and FASN inhibitor in combination showed reduced diameter, as well as reduced cell proliferation, when compared with each agent alone. Overall, our data demonstrate that targeting <i>de novo<\/i> lipogenesis can increase the therapeutic efficacy of PARP inhibitors and benefit prostate cancer patients that do not harbor BRCA mutations, by pharmacologically downregulating DNA damage repair pathways, particularly HR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/19e5ed64-1b17-455f-8f42-2197f97e5a49\/@A03B8ZKe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Lipid metabolism,Prostate cancer,Fatty acid synthase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13668"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caroline Fidalgo Ribeiro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia D.

Although PD-1 based checkpoint inhibition is standard initial therapy, McM has been shown to respond less often than cutaneous melanoma. We explored the hypothesis of this resistance being due to a lower tumor mutational burden (TMB) and high levels of chromosomal instability resulting in the formation of micronuclei, a greater than average fraction of genome altered (FGA) as defined by the MSK-IMPACT hybridization capture based NGS platform, and decreased immune infiltration. We utilized MSK-IMPACT data, to collect TMB and FGA data from 112 mucosal melanoma patients of which 56 had received frontline PD-1 based immunotherapy (28 a-PD-1 nivolumab\/pembrolizumab, 28 nivolumab + ipilimumab). This population had a median follow-up time of 92 months, median progression free survival (PFS) of 13 months and median overall survival (OS) of 47 months. Dichotomized TMB was not associated with PFS or OS. However, higher than median FGA was associated with a significantly worse PFS (median 16 months vs. not reached [NR]) and OS (median 38months vs. NR). We then explored the association to traditional markers of chromosomal instability using multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) in tumor samples taken from 18 patients within the treatment cohort. We quantified cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) positive micronuclei present and found that FGA correlated directly with the number of micronuclei in the tumor, supporting that FGA is a reasonable indicator of chromosomal instability. As expected, there was no such association with micronuclei and TMB. Using multiplex IF we quantified CD8+ and CD8xPD1 co-positive cells at the tumor invading margin. Tumors with higher FGA had lower infiltration of CD8+ cells and CD8xPD1 co-positive cells. The same relationship was found when directly comparing number of micronuclei to CD8+ and CD8xPD1 co-positive cells. Our data suggests that patients with McM that harbor higher levels of chromosomal instability characterized by presence of micronuclei and resultant higher fraction of genome altered on MSK-IMPACT have fewer PD1+\/CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment and have inferior progression-free and overall survival with standard PD-1 blockade. This immunosuppressive mechanism may represent a uniquely poor prognosis group that may benefit from altering the downstream signaling resultant of chromosomal instability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/688cf07e-3444-4314-b76c-95f76a69aa33\/@A03B8ZKe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Chromosomal instability,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13669"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emma Armstrong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee Gottesdiener<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikolaus Schultz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel F.

COSMIC identifies signatures of biological and environmental events that drive mutational processes and can be identified by examining patterns of somatic mutations. We describe the complexity of the COSMIC mutational signatures and their impact. We introduce Shannon entropy as a metric to measure complexity of trinucleotide distributions, thus capturing a previously ignored dimension of mutational signatures that may predict their identification. Shannon entropy derives from the rich predictive mathematics of information theory. We calculated entropy for all the COSMIC mutation signatures and found that SBS3, homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) signature, had highest entropy of 6.326, while SBS2 signature, activation of AID\/APOBEC cytidine deaminases, had the lowest entropy of 1.758.We discovered that high entropy signatures (such as HRD SBS3) require more somatic mutations to be reliably detected than do low entropy signatures, important when planning signature detection using targeted panels that have smaller genomic footprint. We demonstrate this correlation with two approaches i) by simulation using MutSigSim, a tool we developed for simulating mutational profiles given the number of mutations, and ii) by using real datasets. Simulation was performed for high, medium, and low entropy signatures. We used cosine similarity of 0.7 as the threshold for detection. For signatures with entropy &#60;2, a signature can be detected 90% of the time with 10 or more mutations. Similarly, signatures with entropies between 2-3, 3-5 and &#62;5 can be detected 90% of the time with 30, 40, and 100 mutations, respectively. Mutation signatures of 1500 samples from a pan solid tumor cohort sequenced with Oncomine Comprehensive Assay Plus or Oncomine TMB were used to confirm these conclusions. We saw that signatures with higher entropy were difficult to detect at cosine similarity threshold of 0.7 in samples with a smaller number of mutations. In a cohort of samples with MSI-high, we detected mismatch repair (MMR) signatures with low to medium entropy with high specificity and good sensitivity. Furthermore, in a cohort of Ovarian cancer samples, it was difficult to detect the high entropy HRD signature at 0.7 threshold when the number of somatic mutations was not high. We show that ability to detect mutation signatures using targeted panels is directly correlated to the complexity of signature and number of mutations. For research use only.

Cells deficient in MMR exhibit increased expansion and contraction of short repeat sequences in the genome, termed microsatellite instability (MSI). Loss of MMR also results in resistance to certain classes of DNA damaging chemotherapeutics. The standard treatment option for most patients includes chemotherapy, which has toxic side effects. Immunotherapy has recently been utilized as a treatment for various cancers. MSI-high cancers respond better to immunotherapy treatment compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers. This increased response is believed to be due to the higher mutation frequencies associated with the MSI-high tumors, which lead to greater neoantigen production. The primary proteins required for MMR are known, however regulation of the pathway is not well understood. The MLH1 protein is critical for MMR and is required for the excision licensing of the daughter DNA strand. Loss or mutation of MLH1 leads to defective MMR, increased mutation frequency, and MSI. Recent studies by our laboratory and others have shown that treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib, leads to decreased MLH1 protein expression, and resistance to MMR-dependent apoptosis. These observations suggest a link between Imatinib-sensitive protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and the regulation of MMR. We show that MLH1 protein reduction is not occurring at the mRNA level and is thought to be post-transcriptional. We have identified the Imatinib sensitive target most likely responsible for the MLH1 reduction phenotype. We show that the target protein and MLH1 have a physical interaction that likely prevents degradation targeting of MLH1 by the Hsp70 chaperone. A detailed understanding of MMR regulation by PTKs would significantly advance the knowledge in the field of MMR and have important implications for immunotherapy strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/115e8eed-75ad-4791-983d-0ee826441fc9\/@A03B8ZKe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mismatch repair,Regulation,Tyrosine kinase,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13671"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hannah Daniels<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Breanna Knicely<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva M.

Studies on the mechanisms underlying DNA replication stress caused by frequently deregulated oncogenes, like MYC or RAS, can identify novel mechanisms of oncogenesis and point to actionable pathways with potential for anticancer therapy.<br \/>To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this cellular response, we used high-content microscopy to monitor the dynamic behavior of &#62;60 GFP-tagged proteins linked to replication stress or DNA damage in primary human cells. Iterations of this screen identified a proteomic signature specific to MYC- and RAS-driven replication stress that was significantly different from responses activated by other sources of replication stress (i.e. DNA damaging drugs). These findings indicated that the replication stress response to oncogenes is somewhat unique. MYC-dependent replication stress responses typically activated the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex &#8212; a highly conserved complex necessary for maintenance of genome stability in yeast. Core components of the INO80 complex assembled onto chromatin at MYC-bound sites and were quantitatively enriched at active replication forks. These molecular events were independent of transcription, and their disruption by pharmacological or genetic means specifically altered replication dynamics and cellular growth in cells overexpressing MYC.<br \/>Notably, we identified recurrent somatic mutations in several genes encoding for INO80 complex components across multiple cancer types, with an abundance of nonsense and splice-site mutations consistent with loss of function. Most of these mutant variants behaved as hypomorphs when tested in cell-based assays: they were insensitive to MYC deregulation and failed to rescue cell proliferation in knock-out cells with MYC overexpression. Computational predictions also suggested that many of these mutations had been selected as potential cancer drivers. Consistent with this notion, we found that <i>in vivo<\/i>, INO80 complex mutations shortened tumor latency in a mouse model of MYC-dependent lymphomagenesis. Collectively, these findings indicate that the replication stress response to oncogene deregulation is unique in its molecular architecture, and modification of this response by partial loss-of-function mutations in cancer facilitates tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8aa782c1-3478-4c51-867f-9af60ad861d5\/@B03B8ZKf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Replication stress,INO80,Chromatin remodeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13672"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Rosa Vinas-Castells<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alja Kozulic-Pirher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomás Aparicio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Casas Recasens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark P.

ALDH1A1 is a major subtype contributing to high ALDH activity out of all ALDH isoforms and plays a critical role in the maintenance of cancer stem cells. Our previous studies have shown that ALDH1A1 is able to reduce the sensitivity of BRCA2-\/- ovarian cancer cells to PARP inhibitors by enhancing microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). MMEJ uses 5-25 base pair micro homologous sequences to align the broken strands before joining, and this repair pathway requires DNA polymerase &#952; (Pol &#952;, encoded by <i>POLQ<\/i>). Here we show that ALDH1A1 can increase the expression of Pol &#952;, at both mRNA and protein levels, in ovarian cancer cell lines. ALDH1A1 is reported to catalyze the production of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which can bind to the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), and promote transcription of the downstream target genes that possess retinoic acid response element (RARE) in their promoter regions. Interestingly we identified several RAREs in the promoter region of the <i>POLQ<\/i> gene. Thus, we hypothesized that ALDH1A1 promotes Pol &#952; expression via activation of the RAR signaling pathway. We found that ATRA and RAR agonist (CH55) increased but pan RAR antagonist (AGN193109) treatment decreased the expression of POLQ, indicating that the RAR pathway is involved in the transcription of POLQ. We also demonstrated that RAR&#945; can bind to the promoter region of Pol Q, activation of RAR signaling by treatment with ATRA or CH55 increased the enrichment of K27 acetylated histone H3 in this promoter region. Moreover, we showed that mutated ALDH1A1 lacking the enzyme activity was unable to enhance POLQ transcription. These data suggest that ALDH1A1 enhances the Pol Q expression by increasing the production of ATRA which further activates the RAR signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fc101c4f-202c-46e0-bc2f-7db2c3fa26d9\/@B03B8ZKf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,ALDH1A1,MMEJ,PARP Inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18397"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kousalya Lavudi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ananya Banerjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shurui Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuetao Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wang Qi-En<\/i><\/presenter>.

RS is defined as an uncoupling of the replicative helicase and DNA polymerase, resulting in long stretches of fragile single stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is prone to damage. Excessive RS can result in replication catastrophe and cell death, which could be leveraged as a therapeutic strategy to treat high-RS cancers. While overexpression of certain oncogenes has been implicated as a driver of RS in cancer, the precise cellular conditions that result in RS have been difficult to predict. Here we demonstrate that high copy number amplification of genes on non-native extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is associated with elevated RS in comparison to the same amplification on linear chromosomes. The ecDNA bearing cells display heightened basal levels of phosphorylated RPA, a hallmark of ssDNA, and decreased replication fork velocities. Consistent with this finding, the ecDNA amplified cells display greater sensitivity to inhibitors of deoxyribonucleotide production relative to cells harboring chromosomal gene amplification and to normal cells. Moreover, ecDNA bearing cells demonstrate a dramatic vulnerability to reduction in the conditionally essential amino acid glutamine, the primary nitrogen source for <i>de novo<\/i> nucleotide biosynthesis. The enhanced sensitivity to glutamine starvation is directly correlated with a reduction in ecDNA in tumor cells, and a corresponding selection for chromosomally integrated gene amplification in the surviving population. These phenotypes are rescued with nucleoside supplementation but not anaplerotic TCA cycle intermediates, further reinforcing a link between ecDNA and RS biology. Collectively, observations made here support a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced RS shaped by ecDNA driven oncogene amplification, revealing a novel molecular strategy to identify high-RS tumors and a therapeutic approach to target this &#8220;Achilles heel&#8221; of tumor biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58efa17a-2705-4ff6-b596-c55557d4b8b0\/@B03B8ZKf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Replication stress,extrachromosomal DNA,gene amplification,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21207"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sudhir Chowdhry<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Salvador Garcia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nam-Phuong Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Celeste<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edison Tse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Snezana Milutinovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepti Wilkinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Hassig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shailaja Kasibhatla<\/i><\/presenter>.
