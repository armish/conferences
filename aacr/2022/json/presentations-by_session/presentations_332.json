[{"Abstract":"Therapy options for advanced and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) include the use of drugs targeting directly\/indirectly the ligand binding domain (LBD) of androgen receptor (AR) such as enzalutamide (Enza) and abiraterone acetate. However, primary or acquired treatment failures are frequently observed and have been associated with the expression of truncated AR variants devoid of the LBD. In particular, the AR variant AR3, also known as ARV7, is detected in over 80% of CRPC specimen and is increasingly expressed in metastatic lesions. In PC models ARV7 expression causes treatment resistance to Enza. Moreover, ARV7 expression leads to increased expression of mesenchymal markers and stem cell signature genes. CDH2 (N-Cadherin) expression is increased by ARV7 binding to regulatory elements in intron 1 of CDH2, which is antagonized by full length (FL) AR. Based on these observations we hypothesize that ARV7 is a marker and regulator of PC stemness and\/or plasticity.<br \/>ARFL or ARV7 mRNA and protein was detected in cell lines and tissue samples by standard procedures including qRT-PCR, RNA in situ hybridization (RISH), immunofluorescence (IF) and western blotting using the monoclonal ARV7 antibody RM7. ARFL or ARV7 stably expressing LNCaP were obtained by lentiviral transduction. LNCaP cells resistant to Enza (LNCaP-Enza) were generated by exposure to increasing concentrations (up to 5 &#181;M) of the drug. Transcriptome analysis in LNCaP-Enza vs. LNCaP was done by RNAseq and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.<br \/>ARV7 mRNA was detectable in LNCaP, albeit gene expression was 2.3% - 2.6% of the known ARV7 positive cell lines 22Rv1 and VCaP, respectively. RISH and IF demonstrated that only a fraction (~10%) of LNCaP cells expressed ARV7 mRNA and nuclear localized ARV7 protein. ARV7 mRNA was also detected in isolated epithelial and stromal areas in treatment-na&#239;ve prostate cancer specimen by RISH. In contrast, all LNCaP-Enza cells were positive for nuclear ARV7 protein. Transcriptome analysis of LNCaP-Enza cells showed enrichments for published ARV7 gene expression signatures.<br \/>Insular spots of ARV7 mRNA were detected in treatment-na&#239;ve tissue and in isolated cells of the castration-sensitive cell line LNCaP suggesting that these cells could be intrinsically resistant against LBD-targeting drugs and responsible for the failure of various endocrine therapies. This project will further analyze whether this subpopulation possesses stem cell (-like)\/plasticity characteristics and whether these are regulated by ARV7.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6d3e85b3-c099-4a70-993e-124125ae504e\/@A03B8ZCy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-01 Endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Stemness,Androgen independence,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15180"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tobias Furlan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Handle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus V.

Similarly, mice exposed in utero to the estrogenic EDC bisphenol A (BPA) have increased susceptibility to mammary gland tumors. It is unclear which BPA-induced alterations predispose the mammary gland to cancer transformation. There is a critical need to understand the mechanisms that drive increased cancer risk in order to assess the impact of BPA and BPA alternatives that retain estrogenic activity. We have utilized in utero BPA exposure as a model system for in utero estrogenic endocrine disruption to study the long-term consequences to the mouse mammary stroma. We found that BPA exposed fibroblasts showed significant transcriptional deregulation, with the extracellular matrix being the most altered cellular component and multiple collagen genes being more highly expressed. The fibroblasts from the BPA exposed mice decreased fluid permeability of the extracellular matrix, indicative of an increased density in the extracellular matrix. Also, in utero BPA exposure increased mammary gland stiffness. Changes to breast density, stiffness, and collagen deposition are all associated with breast cancer risk. Further, we test BPA alternative compounds with varying affinities for the estrogen receptor in our in utero model to assess the phenotypes in the mouse mammary stroma which are associated with breast cancer risk. Additionally, we use a mesenchymal estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) knockout mouse model to dissect the in utero cellular target of EDCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d343e67c-3e1d-4e1c-b2bf-ac4f65b0688c\/@A03B8ZCy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-01 Endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Endocrine distruptors,Estrogen receptor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15181"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Clarissa Wormsbaecher<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea R.

BB stimulates whereas the BB2 receptor (R) antagonist PD176252 inhibits NSCLC growth (Moody et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol; 2003; 474:21). The BB2R regulates the transactivation of the EGFR, HER2 and HER3 (Lee et al., BBAMCR 2020; 1867: 118625). HER4 increases the proliferation of NSCLC cells (Mota et al., Oncotarget 2017; 8: 89284). It is unknown if BB2R stimulation increases tyrosine phosphorylation of HER4 and this was investigated using NSCLC cells. BB or neuregulin (NRG1) addition to NSCLC cells increased the phosphorylation of Tyr1284-HER4. By RT-PCR and western blot, mRNA and protein for BB2R, HER4 and NRG1 was present in NCI-H522 and NCI-H661 NSCLC cells. The addition of BB to NCI-H522 or NCI-H661 cells increased phosphorylation of HER4, ERK and AKT which was blocked by PD176252. By immunoprecipitation, HER4 heterodimerized with HER2 and the EGFR after addition of BB to NSCLC cells. PP2 and N-acetylcysteine impaired the ability of BB to increase P-Tyr1284-HER4 in NSCLC cells, which indicates that SRC and reactive oxygen species are essential. Ibrutinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Rauf et al., Oncogene 2018; 37: 2237), impaired the ability of BB2Rs to regulate HER4 transactivation. Ibrutinib or PD176252 inhibited the growth of NSCLC cells whereas BB or NRG1 increased NSCLC colony formation. The results indicate that peptide receptors for BB regulate HER4 transactivation and the proliferation of NSCLC cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f62eddc9-607d-4ca9-b129-4a465857ca2e\/@A03B8ZCy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-02 Growth factors, receptors, and signal transduction,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB receptors,Peptides,Tyrosine kinase,Growth inhibition,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15183"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Terry W.

Barriers to screening reduces compliance and negatively impacts patient outcomes, necessitating alternatives. A blood-based approach provides a more convenient and accessible modality, but serum markers are lacking. Using a meta-transcriptomics approach, we identified Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 (FGF19), an enteroendocrine FGF responsible for bile acid (BA) homeostasis, as an attractive CRC marker. However, whether FGF19 is aberrantly secreted into blood by colorectal tumors or induces endocrine-like paraneoplastic effects is unknown. To assess the strength of FGF19 as a CRC biomarker, expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression consortium (GTEx), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-COADREAD), and our curated Meta-dataset (E-MTAB-10089) were downloaded and analyzed for associations with prognostic indicators. Next, <i>in silico<\/i> FGF19 expression profiles were validated <i>in vitro<\/i> using a panel of five CRC cell lines via western blot with secretion quantitated by sandwich ELISA. To determine whether colorectal tumors contribute FGF19 to circulation, subcutaneous xenografts of HCT116 and Colo201 cells were established in four male and female <i>NOD Scid gamma<\/i> (NSG) mice. Tumor volume, as well as serum and urine FGF19 were assessed weekly over a 36-day period. Following euthanasia, murine liver and ileal tissue were processed for downstream mRNA and bile acid quantification. To determine if malignant FGF19 exerts paraneoplastic effects RNA sequencing was performed on hepatic mRNA using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system. Reads were processed, aligned, mapped, and analyzed for differential expression and functional enrichment using an integrated informatics pipeline implemented in <i>R<\/i>. Meta-transcriptomics revealed that ectopic overexpression of FGF19 was highly indicative of CRC and associated with unfavorable prognostic indicators including disease progression, treatment failure, and poor survival. <i>In vitro <\/i>testing recapitulated <i>in silico<\/i> findings, showing that that four out of five CRC cell lines constitutively express and secrete FGF19. We also readily detected FGF19 in serum and urine of mice harboring xenografts derived from Colo201, but not HCT116, cells. Moreover, circulating FGF19 levels increased with tumor size and exerted paraneoplastic effects on liver tissue such as suppression of BA synthesis, dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism, and induction of pre-neoplasia. In summary, we describe FGF19 as a putative serum CRC biomarker that exerts novel endocrine-like paraneoplastic effects on the liver. Study limitations included the lack of FGF19 quantification in CRC patient blood, <i>in vivo <\/i>experimentation using two different cell lines, and gender-related batch effects identified by RNA sequencing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71a9fca4-0c97-4a4c-a24d-7b16ec13640b\/@A03B8ZCy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-02 Growth factors, receptors, and signal transduction,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Bile acid,Colorectal cancer,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4  (FGFR-4),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15184"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Walter Rohr<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Beardsley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sai Preethi Nakkina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dexter Hadley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deborah Altomare<\/i><\/presenter>.

ILC has a unique loss of E-cadherin (<i>CDH1<\/i>) which we have previously demonstrated as a negative regulator of the Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) through a comprehensive analysis of cell line models and tumor samples. We propose that loss of E-cadherin in ILC sensitizes cells to growth factor signaling and thus alters their sensitivity to growth factor signaling inhibitors. To investigate this, we used CRISPR to generate <i>CDH1<\/i> knockout (KO) IDC cell lines (MCF7, T47D, ZR75.1) to uncover the mechanism by which E-cadherin loss activates the IGF pathway while also assessing its targetability. <i>CDH1<\/i> KO cells exhibited anchorage independent growth in suspension culture and altered p120 catenin localization as observed in ILC tumors. Through <i>in vitro<\/i> studies, we show increased signaling sensitivity to IGF\/ insulin ligands and enhanced signaling duration in <i>CDH1<\/i> KO cells. In addition, we observed a higher migratory potential of <i>CDH1<\/i> KO cells compared to wild type (WT) cells, which was further enhanced as a chemotactic response to IGF1 or serum. Further, this phenotype could be reversed with an IGF1R inhibitor, BMS-754807. We additionally identified an increase in Collagen I haptotaxis in the <i>CDH1 <\/i>KO cells, which was also translated into a novel invasive phenotype towards serum in the T47D <i>CDH1 <\/i>KO cells. Despite no significant differences in membranous IGF1R levels between WT and <i>CDH1 <\/i>KO cells, higher ligand-receptor interaction was observed with<i> CDH1<\/i> KO cells, demonstrating an increased ligand-receptor complex formation upon stimulation. Our results suggest that loss of <i>CDH1<\/i> results in an increase in IGF1 receptor availability for ligand binding which in turn allows for an enhanced downstream signaling activation. Interestingly, a physical repression of E-cadherin on IGF1R could not be demonstrated, suggesting spatial changes on the membrane following E-cadherin loss may control ligand binding. Critically, increased sensitivity to IGF1R, PI3K, AKT and MEK inhibitors was observed in <i>CDH1<\/i> KO cells suggesting that these targets should be further explored in ILC and that <i>CDH1<\/i> loss may be exploited as a biomarker of response, or for patient stratification to inhibitors targeting these pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2b979180-04a1-4555-bae4-b97b00e86b43\/@B03B8ZCz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-02 Growth factors, receptors, and signal transduction,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"invasive lobular carcinoma,IGF-1,E-cadherin,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15185"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ashuvinee Elangovan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Savariau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan E.

There is urgent need for discovery of biomarkers of prognostic significance, predictive value and as well as therapeutic targets in patients with pancreatic cancer. In this study, we examined the relative expression and prognostic significance of all HER family members and the type III EGFR mutant (EGFRvIII) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDC). The expression levels of wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR), HER2, HER3, HER4 and EGFRvIII were determined in tumor specimens from 43 patients by immunohistochemistry using antibodies DAK-H1-WT, Neu 3B5, SP71, HFR1 and NBP2-50599 respectively. The staining was scored based on the percentage of positive tumor cells, the intensity (i.e. strong 3+, moderate 2+, weak 1+) and the cellular location of immunostaining (i.e. membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear). The association between the expression level of the biomarkers and patient overall survival was evaluated using Chi-squared, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log rank test. At cut-off value of above 5%, we found weak to moderate expression of wtEGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4 and EGFRvIII in 4.7%, 14%, 14%, 20.9% and 2.3% of the cases examined respectively. The cellular location of wtEGFR and HER2 was found to be predominantly cytoplasmic, HER-3 membranous and cytoplasmic whereas HER4 expression was found to be mainly nuclear. There was no statistically significant association between the expression level of these markers and patient overall survival. The expression levels of the above biomarkers were also evaluated in tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 40 cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, at the same cut-off value, 62.5%, 75%, 0%, 55% and 5% of the TMAs were positive for wtEGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4 and EGFRvIII respectively. Overall, we found that the expression pattern of HER family members was heterogenous, and with EGFRvIII expression being very low in both whole tumor sections and TMAs from patients with pancreatic cancer. Taken together, our results provide support for more detailed studies of co-expression of all HER family members in a larger group of pancreatic cancer patients. Such studies should help to unravel their potential as targets for therapeutic interventions as well as their prognostic significance and predictive value for response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c2fdf371-b819-4e0e-bdf1-85f493b8c015\/@B03B8ZCz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Growth factors, receptors, and signal transduction,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,EGFR,HER2,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15186"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tanzeel Khan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Said A.

By lacking the ligand-binding domain, AR-V7 is constitutively active and may therefore bypass AR signaling inhibitors. Treating CRPC involves improved AR signaling inhibitors or taxane-based chemotherapy. However, the optimal treating sequence may differ from patient to patient. The presence of AR-V7 in the nucleus of circulating PCa cells, which is associated with AR targeted therapy resistance, is used as a therapy-guiding biomarker. This stratification has a high predictive power and specificity, but its sensitivity is unsatisfying and can only be done by highly specialized laboratories. A PCR\/sequencing based test would improve the sensitivity of this biomarker, but it requires a better understanding of AR-V7&#8217;s functional regulation. Therefore, we aim here to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3&#8217; untranslated region (UTR) of AR-V7 that might have an impact on AR-V7&#8217;s expression and\/or functional activity.<br \/>The LD trait tool of NIH was used to search for trait association with AR cryptic exon (CE3) SNPs. Four RNA binding motif databases (oRNAment, ATtRACT, RBP map, and RBPDB) and SpliceAid v2 were used for evaluating SNPs in their capacity to alter motifs. By CRISPR\/CAS9 mediated non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) these predictions were assessed experimentally using qPCR and Westen Blot.<br \/>SNP rs5918762 was selected as it is in linkage disequilibrium with several PCa tagSNPs (rs5919393, rs5919432). rs5918762T\/C is characterized by an unequal minor allele frequency (MAF) distribution among different populations. Using an <i>in silico <\/i>approach, this SNP is predicted to destroy\/create a binding site for the splicing machinery involved protein SRSF9. Disrupting this SNP region via NHEJ resulted respectively in an increased and decreased expression of AR-FL and AR-V7 mRNA in 22RV1 cells (C allele). Additionally, analysis of the SU2C dataset (CRPC patients) correlated SRSF9 expression with AR-V7 expression. Subsequently, SRSF9 knock out (KO) resulted in reduced AR-V7 mRNA expression.<br \/>Our data suggests that SNP rs5918762T\/C is located in a region important for CE3 inclusion during AR splicing, which might involve SRSF9. Further validation of these results is in need and encompasses splicing assays by an AR-V7 mini-gene assay, protein-RNA interaction assays and an analysis of a lack of effect in cell lines expressing the T allele.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/20bfbe00-7589-498f-8893-47a69df1f2ab\/@B03B8ZCz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-03 Hormone receptors and diagnosis\/prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Prostate cancer,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15187"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jasper Van Goubergen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Handle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus V.

Our lab has shown that the effect of 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> on breast cancer cell growth is highly dependent on the expression levels of ER&#945; isoforms, specifically ER&#945;66. Understanding the mechanisms by which 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> affects tumor growth in breast cancer will aid in determining its therapeutic potential in another estrogen responsive cancer, laryngeal cancer. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3 <\/sub>on proliferation, apoptosis, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in laryngeal cancer cell lines. <b><\/b> To assess the effect of 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> on cell growth, UM-SCC-12 (ER&#945;66+) and UM-SCC-11A (ER&#945;66-) cell lines were cultured on 96 well plates until 80% confluence. Cells were serum starved for 24 hours pretreatment and then treated with full media containing either vehicle, or 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> (10<sup>-9<\/sup>M, 10<sup>-8<\/sup>M, or 10<sup>-7<\/sup>M) for 15 minutes, at which time the media were replaced with fresh media. After 20 hours, cells were harvested for proliferation by EDU assay. For other experiments cells were treated with either vehicle, or 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> (10<sup>-9<\/sup>M, 10<sup>-8<\/sup>M, or 10<sup>-7<\/sup>M) for 15 minutes and after 24 hours, cells were assessed for apoptosis (TUNEL, P53) and metastasis (OPG\/RANKL). 12 hours after treatment, cells were harvested for PCR and examined for gene expression of apoptotic markers (BAX, BCL2) and various metastatic markers (SNAI1, ERBB2). 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3 <\/sub>decreased proliferation<sub> <\/sub>in ER&#945;66- cells (UM-SCC-11A) with the 10<sup>-7<\/sup>M dosage. It also increased apoptotic markers (TUNEL, P53, BAX\/BCL2 expression). EMT and metastatic markers (ERBB2, SNAI1 expression) as well as bone metastatic markers (OPG\/RANKL) were reduced. Conversely, in ER&#945;66+ cells (UM-SCC-12) 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> had the opposite effect, increasing proliferation with 10<sup>-7<\/sup>M 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3 <\/sub>treatment as well as decreasing DNA fragmentation (TUNEL). Treatment with 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3 <\/sub>increased total P53 content and had no effect on EMT, BAX\/BCL2 or other metastatic markers (SNAI1, ERBB2, OPG, RANKL). These data<b> <\/b>show that 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3 <\/sub>is functionally active in laryngeal cancer tumor regulation. Contrary to results shown in breast cancer in which 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3 <\/sub>was pro-tumorigenic in ER&#945;66- cells, 24R,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3 <\/sub>was anti-tumorigenic<sub> <\/sub>in ER&#945;66- laryngeal cancer cells.

It is also known that patients with acromegaly (high levels of circulating GH and IGF1) develop AML at a significantly higher rate than the general population, while individuals with GH resistance remain completely resistant to all types of cancer. Despite all of the aforementioned evidence pointing to a critical role of GH in AML progression and prognosis, a detailed transcriptomic analysis of human patients is lacking. We aim to address this gap by thorough <i>in silico <\/i>studies aimed at revealing the nature and extent to which the GH axis can be suitable targeted in AML. Here, we present a summary of our analyses of clinical and transcriptomic data from 200 human patients with AML from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, using multiple bioinformatics software programs in the public domain. Our study revealed that GH receptor (GHR) is expressed more highly in AML than in normal myeloid cells, and a robust correlation exists between GH responsiveness and patient survival. A sex-specific profiling of the patient transcriptomic data identified critical pathways related to therapy resistance, extracellular matrix remodeling, metastasis, and immune evasion to be upregulated differentially in male and female AML patients with relatively elevated GHR expression compared to patients with relatively lower GHR expression. Furthermore, we identified microRNAs which are differentially expressed in AML patients with higher than median GHR expression. We validated these miRNAs to be effective indicators of disease progression and prognosis and can be valuable markers in liquid biopsy approaches.<br \/>Acknowledgement: This work was supported in part by the State of Ohio&#8217;s Eminent Scholar Program that includes a gift from Milton and Lawrence Goll, by the AMVETS, and Ohio University&#8217;s Edison Biotechnology Institute.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/123cf9a8-bbcd-45da-87ed-17ace3eec266\/@B03B8ZCz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-04 Hormone signaling and inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Hormone receptors,Bioinformatics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15193"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emily Davis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reetobrata Basu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John J.

Estrone (E<sub>1<\/sub>) and estradiol (E<sub>2<\/sub>) are converted to the putative carcinogens, 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OHE<sub>1<\/sub>) and 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE<sub>2<\/sub>), by cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1). In contrast, CYP1A1 metabolizes parent estrogens to 2-OHE<sub>1<\/sub> and 2-OHE<sub>2<\/sub>, which may ultimately be converted to anti-proliferative derivatives. Our previous data strongly indicate that 4-OHEs contribute to lung tumorigenesis. However, their role in oncogene-driven NSCLC has not been investigated. The goal of this study was to compare the urinary profile of catechol estrogens in patients with EGFR- and ALK-positive NSCLC with those of cancer-free controls. The resulting levels of estrogen derivatives were correlated with genotypic variants in the estrogen metabolizing enzymes CYP1B1 and COMT. Patients with EGFR- and ALK-mutated NSCLC were recruited from the recently established Never-Smokers Lung Cancer Clinic at our institution. Study participants were 50 years of age or older to circumvent any confounding impact of pre-menopausal status on estrogen profiles. Mutation status was determined from tumor tissue biopsies. Cancer-free control subjects were Caucasian post-menopausal women with no prior smoking history. To date, 34 patients with tumors possessing EGFR mutations, 10 patients with ALK mutations, and 17 cancer-free control subjects have been enrolled. Urine specimens were collected from all participants and urinary estrogen species (E<sub>1<\/sub>, E<sub>2<\/sub>, E<sub>3<\/sub>, 4-OHE<sub>1<\/sub>, 4-OHE<sub>2<\/sub>, 2-OHE<sub>1<\/sub>, 2-OHE<sub>2<\/sub>, 16&#945;-OHE<sub>1<\/sub>, 2-OME<sub>1<\/sub>, 4-OME<sub>1<\/sub>, OME<sub>2<\/sub>) were quantified using a newly established UPLC-MS\/MS method. Blood lymphocytes, collected from NSCLC subjects, were genotyped for SNPs in CYP1B1 (L432V\/rs1056836, R48G\/rs10012, N453S\/rs1800440) and COMT (V158M\/rs4680) by real-time PCR. Preliminary investigation of the E<sub>1<\/sub> metabolic pathway suggests a trend of higher ratios of 4-OHE<sub>1<\/sub> to 2-OHE<sub>1<\/sub> in patients with EGFR- and ALK-positive NSCLC as compared to cancer-free controls. Among NSCLC subjects, those possessing the high activity Leu432 variant of CYP1B1 (Leu\/Leu + Leu\/Val) tended to have higher ratios of 4-OHE<sub>1<\/sub> to 2-OHE<sub>1<\/sub> as compared to patients with the low activity Val\/Val genotype. Early findings suggest enhanced production of C4 estrogen derivates may contribute to the development of oncogene-driven lung tumors. Targeting CYP1B1 may be of preventive and therapeutic interest.

While both ionizing radiation (RT) and endocrine therapies (ET) are used for the treatment of ER+ BC, the effect of ET on tumor radiosensitization remains unclear, with concerns it may be radioprotective based on G1 cell arrest with ET treatment. Here we assessed the efficacy and mechanism of ER-mediated radiosensitization using various pharmacologic approaches in ER+ BC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Radiosensitization with ER inhibitors (tamoxifen [TAM], fulvestrant [FULV], AZD9496) was assessed using clonogenic survival assays. DNA damage was assessed by the neutral comet assay. Efficiency of homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) as well as changes in cell cycle, apoptosis, and senescence were assessed. The efficacy of TAM with RT <i>in vivo <\/i>was assessed with an MCF-7 xenograft model<i>.<\/i><br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The selective estrogen receptor modulator TAM radiosensitized ER+ MCF-7 (enhancement ratio [enhR]: 1.14-1.50) and T47D (enhR: 1.33-1.60) cells but not ER-negative SUM-159 cells (enhR: 0.99-1.02). The selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) FULV had similar radiosensitization effects in MCF-7 (enhR: 1.33-1.76) and T47D cells (enhR: 0.97-2.81) with no radiosensitization observed in SUM-159 cells (enhR: 1.01-1.03). The novel oral SERD AZD9496 radiosensitized MCF-7 cells (enhR: 1.36-1.56). MCF-7 cells treated with TAM and RT had an increase in dsDNA breaks compared to RT alone as measured by the comet assay (p&#60;0.05) and a decrease in NHEJ-mediated repair with TAM (p&#60;0.05). No changes were observed in HR-mediated repair by Rad51 foci or a reporter (p=NS). RT alone and in combination with TAM or FULV induced similar levels of cell cycle arrest, suggesting that radiosensitization with the combination therapy is cell-cycle independent. There were no significant changes in apoptosis with TAM, FULV, RT, or the combination (p=NS). Although TAM or FULV did induce senescence, ET with RT increased senescence induction (p&#60;0.05). <i>In vivo<\/i>, combination RT and TAM led to a significant delay in days to tumor doubling (control: 17, TAM: 40, RT: 32, TAM+RT: undefined; p&#60;0.0001), and a significant difference in tumor growth between mice treated with TAM or RT alone compared combination treatment, with no increased toxicities or skin lesions from the combination treatment. Conclusion<b>: <\/b>Our data suggest that TAM, FULV, or AZD9496 can radiosensitize ER+ breast tumors, and these agents with RT may be more effective for radiosensitization. This work also supports further clinical investigation of the timing of RT for patients receiving ET, including using ET during RT, especially as initiating ET prior to RT has been increasingly utilized as a bridging therapy followed by concurrent ET+RT during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f5ad160-9995-4eaa-9a5a-641a35bc6db4\/@B03B8ZCz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-08 Preclinical studies of endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Endocrine Therapy,Radiosensitization,Nonhomologous end joining,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15196"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna R.

Unfortunately, 30-40% of ER+ patients still experience recurrence and metastasis, with a 5-year relative overall survival rate of just 24% for patients with metastatic disease. Previously, we described an increased reliance on NAD+ metabolism in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) cells, which are driven by clonal selection from monotherapy resistance and the metastatic organ microenvironment. In the current study, we investigated if inhibition of NAMPT to block NAD+ production would synergize with standard of care therapies for ER+ MBC. Combination therapy of the NAMPT Inhibitor, KPT9274 and the ER&#945; agonist Fulvestrant (Fulv) synergistically reduced tumor burden in liver metastasis in vitro (combination index &#60; 1 in cell viability assays) and in vivo in mouse xenograft models. A synergistic effect was not observed when KPT-9274 was combined with Palbociclib or Tamoxifen, nor Fulv with other metabolic inhibitors. RNA-Seq analysis showed that NAMPT inhibition restored antiestrogenic activity of Fulv. Metabolomics analysis showed that NAMPT inhibition reduced abundance of metabolites associated with glucose and lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that NAMPT is recruited to ER&#945; binding sites in MBC xenografts and PDX tumors. Targeting metabolic adaptations in endocrine-resistant metastatic breast tumors is a novel approach that could lead to new combined therapies that reduce mortality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d4c37459-a293-4353-8d10-58862fd157b8\/@B03B8ZCz\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-08 Preclinical studies of endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic tumors,Drug resistance,Breast cancer,Estrogen Receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15197"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ayca N.

ILC is recognized for unique metastatic organotropism. Its propensity to metastasize to serosal surfaces lining the gut (peritoneum) and lung (pleura) make it particularly challenging to diagnose and consequently is associated with overall unfavorable prognosis. We hypothesize that GR activation will slow cell proliferation and reduce metastatic potential of ILC cells in vitro and in vivo. Using transcriptome data from 142 ILC tumors with long-term follow up clinical data from the METABRIC dataset we found a trend towards improved overall patient survival with increased GR (NR3C1) expression (and presumably activity). Preliminary in vitro data showed slowed cell proliferation in an ILC cell line (MDA-MB-134IV) treated with GR agonist dexamethasone relative to vehicle control. ILC cell lines (MDA-MB-134IV and SUM44PE) have dramatically different adhesion preference for extracellular components and we will study whether GR mediates the metastatic organotrophism of ILC cells. Preliminary transcriptome data lends insight into the proliferative and adhesive gene expression changes elicited by both ER and GR activation. Two GR+ ILC patient derived organoid lines have GR dependent proliferative and adhesive phenotypes. In future studies we will utilize an in vivo mouse model that recapitulates ILC progression from an in situ to invasive breast carcinoma and finally to metastatic colonization of distant organs to determine the role of GR activity in proliferation and metastasis to the serosal surfaces.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd979aee-ec07-4e9e-bee8-988d7d9ed1bd\/@B03B8ZCz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-10 Steroid hormone receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glucocorticoid receptor,invasive lobular carcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15200"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Candace Frerich<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ishrat Durdana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ariella Hanker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos L.

LCT belong to the family of sex cord stromal tumors (SCST), a collection of tumors formed in the supporting tissue within the ovaries or testes. Although 90% of LCT are considered benign and can be cured by orchiectomy, in adult patients about 10% of LCT are malignant and metastasis is common. Non-resectable metastatic disease is poorly responsive to radiation and chemotherapy and patients are advised to seek clinical trials. Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1, or NR5A1) is a transcription factor that is essential for the development of the adrenal gland and gonads. SF-1 mutations result in disorders of sexual development, ovarian failure, and adrenal insufficiency. SF-1 is necessary for development of fetal and adult Leydig cells and is strongly expressed in LCT. Significant data support the role of SF-1 in adrenocortical cancer (ACC). To address the need for a targeted therapy in ACC and other SF-1-dependent malignancies, Orphagen has identified potent small molecule antagonists to SF-1*. Here, using R2C, a rat Leydig tumor cell line, we demonstrate that small molecule antagonists of SF-1 inhibit Leydig tumor cell proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. OR-449, an orally available inhibitor of SF-1 transcriptional activity (SF-1 Luc IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 16 nM) and OR-907S, a<i> <\/i>probe SF-1 antagonist (SF-1 Luc IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 22 nM), exhibit striking anti-proliferative activity in R2C cell cultures, inhibiting DNA synthesis by &#62;90% at 1 &#956;M with estimated IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of 0.068 &#956;M and 0.074 &#956;M, respectively. OR-907R, the ~100-fold less active stereoisomer of OR-907S (SF-1 Luc IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 2 &#956;M) was significantly less active in the R2C proliferation assay (estimated IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62;10 &#956;M). Moreover, in cell lines lacking SF-1 expression, such as HEK293, SF-1 antagonists have no anti-proliferative activity up to 20 &#956;M, suggesting that the anti-proliferative effect on R2C is SF-1-mediated and not due to cytotoxicity. Furthermore, OR-449 completely blocks R2C xenograft tumor growth in immunocompromised mice at an oral dose of 30 mg\/kg\/day. OR-449 also dose-dependently regulates expression of SF-1 responsive genes, a mRNA signature first identified in R2C culture by comparison of the activity of OR-907S and OR-907R at 1 &#956;M. OR-449 has excellent pharmacokinetic properties and is well-tolerated in repeat dosing toxicity studies in rodents and non-rodents*. These results highlight SF-1 antagonism as a novel targeted therapeutic approach with potential utility in the treatment of LCT and other SCST. OR-449 is currently in IND-enabling studies in order to enter the clinic by the end of 2022. * P. Crowe, et al.
