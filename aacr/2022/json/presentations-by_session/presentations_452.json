[{"Abstract":"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent, non-cutaneous, cancer in men in the Western world. Disease confined to the prostate can be cured, but metastatic disease cannot. PCa metastases are found in bone, lymph-nodes, liver and other visceral organs (visceral), in decreasing order of frequency. After an initial response to androgen receptor directed therapy, metastatic disease will inevitably recur as metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which is hallmarked by high morbidity and mortality. Since it is previously established, that the site of metastasis correlates with prostate cancer survival, we need a better understanding of metastatic organotropism. Therefore, we took advantage of the largest Whole Genome Sequencing (HiSeq X Ten system using the paired-end sequencing protocol) data set of mCRPC metastases to date. Molecular profiling of 326 metastases (Bone: 105, Lymph-node: 149, Liver: 49, Visceral: 23) revealed genetic determinants associated with organ-specific metastasis. First, we assessed differential occurrence of mutations in genes associated with targetable pathways. RB1 alteration were enriched in liver (35%) and in visceral metastases (30%), while lower rates were found in bone (10%) and lymph-nodes (13%)(Fisher exact test, p: 0.012). Analysis of aggregated pathway alteration data revealed a trend for increased frequency of alterations in the DNA repair and PI3K pathways in lymph node vs. bone metastases (p: 0.066 and 0.066, respectively). Next, we explored differential tumor mutational burden (TMB) between the sites. A higher TMB was observed in liver and visceral metastases compared to bone and lymph node metastases, while there was no difference between liver and visceral. The increased TMB in liver and visceral samples was associated with an MMR-deficiency mutational signature. Alterations in <i>MSH6<\/i>, <i>MLH1<\/i> and <i>POLD3<\/i> characterized a significant proportion of high TMB liver metastases, whereas high TMB visceral metastases predominantly showed <i>MSH2<\/i> and <i>POLD1<\/i> alterations.In conclusion: Our findings implicate high TMB\/MMR-deficiency is a characteristic feature of liver and visceral PCa metastases, potentially impacting disease progression. Moreover, since response to immune check-point inhibitors is associated with high TMB, our findings might direct choice of therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3f7668ae-061f-461c-b6ae-ff506913d5eb\/@v03B8ZLR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Metastasis,Mutations,Tumor mutational burden,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11772"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Daniel Vis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sander Palit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Corradi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martijn Lolkema<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niven Mehra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edwin Cuppen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lodewyk FA Wessels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rene Bernards<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wilbert Zwart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michiel S.

This PDX model provides a unique opportunity to explore the relationships between primary tumors, CTCs, and metastases.<br \/>Methods: BL0293-F563 tumors (available from the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository [https:\/\/pdmr.cancer.gov\/] and originally developed by Jackson Laboratories) were implanted into NSG mice, and primary tumors, metastatic nodules in the liver, and blood were collected at maximal allowable tumor burden. Tumor tissue was dissociated using Miltenyi Tumor Dissociation Kit with OctoDissociator, and Human CTCs were enriched from mouse blood through negative selection with anti-mouse CD45 and anti-mouse MHC-1 magnetic beads. Single cell sequencing was done using 10X Genomics 3&#8217; gene expression assay v3.1. Data processing and analysis was done using 10X Genomics&#8217; Cell Ranger pipeline, Seurat, and cNMF.<br \/>Results: single cell RNAseq data from primary tumors, CTCs, and metastases from 9 mice were aggregated into a single dataset, and cells were classified into 17 clusters using Seurat FindNeighbors. All clusters contained cells from multiple sites (primary tumor, CTCs, metastases), but three clusters were enriched in CTCs and one cluster was composed of mostly primary tumor cells. All clusters exhibited epithelial-like gene expression signature scores, suggesting that CTC shedding was occurring without prominent epithelial-mesenchymal transition. CTC-enriched clusters showed elevated expression of RHO pathway genes, implicating ameboid-like migration in CTC shedding in this PDX model. Consistent with expected differences in oxygenation states, CTC-enriched clusters exhibited a lower hypoxia gene expression score than primary tumor and metastasis-enriched clusters. CTC-enriched clusters also showed higher expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes, suggesting metabolic differences between CTCs and cells from other sites. Additionally, two of three CTC-enriched clusters had elevated expression of mitosis-associated genes, indicating that at least some subpopulations of CTCs are actively cycling. A metastasis suppressor gene KISS1 was expressed in a subset of primary tumor cells but undetectable in CTCs, suggesting that KISS1 expression loss occurs before CTC shedding.<br \/>Conclusions: Utilizing single cell gene expression profiling, we have linked the gene expression profile of CTCs to specific cell subpopulations in primary tumors and metastases. We show that CTC-enriched cell clusters appear to maintain an epithelial phenotype. Subpopulations of CTC cells exhibit enrichment of motility-associated transcripts and features of active cell cycling. Our results implicate a known metastasis suppressor gene KISS1 in CTC shedding and metastatic dissemination in this PDX model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6525b3a7-4480-4f50-8cd1-f7fe426f1ced\/@v03B8ZLR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Metastasis,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11773"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tomas Vilimas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandie Fullmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alyssa Chapman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rini Pauly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ting-Chia Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Biswajit Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Karlovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yvonne Evrard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melinda Hollingshead<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Howard Stotler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Ahalt-Gottholm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tara Grinnage-Pulley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mickey Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James H.

We previously explored the second ER subtype, (ERb) and reported expression in IBC tumors and its correlation with reduced metastasis in patients. We have also seen decreased metastasis of IBC tumors<i> <\/i>when ERb is expressed or activated by chemical agonists. In contrast, ablation of ERb in IBC cells increased migration and stimulated signaling pathways that activate Rho GTPases promoting actin reorganization. We have now mapped all ERb binding sites in IBC cells and by interrogating this information together with gene expression data we identified genomic targets that mediate its tumor repressive effects. Through a combined analysis of cells that express endogenous ERb and knockout cells engineered to re-express the receptor we have defined how a biologically relevant ERb interacts with the cancer cell genome to control metastatic signals in IBC. We reveal key binding motifs and cis-regulatory chromatin sites and associate target genes with clinical outcomes to strengthen the relevance of ERb signaling for the progression of IBC. Our findings thus offer an opportunity to better understand the mechanism of ERb action that is critical step in validating its tumor repressive role in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b168a3c0-cf05-468f-9f63-45e4563028d9\/@v03B8ZLR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor &#946;,Transcriptional regulation,Metastasis,Inflammatory breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11774"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ilias V.

Obesity<b> <\/b>is a recognized epidemic that increases OvCa incidence, enhances metastatic success and reduces survival. We have previously demonstrated a link between obesity and OvCa metastatic success in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model where a significantly enhanced tumor burden was associated with a decreased M1\/M2 tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) ratio (Liu Y et al. Can, Res. 2015; 75:5046-57). TAMs are the most abundant immune cell type in the ovarian tumor microenvironment and are generally categorized as M1-polarized (cytotoxic to tumor cells), or M2-polarized (growth promoting). For this study we sought to examine if a similar correlation between body mass index (BMI) and TAMs were also true for human ovarian cancer patients. Furthermore, we used the DIO mouse model to examine any potential effect of obesity on response to chemotherapy.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>We analyzed high grade serous ovarian tumors from 6 normal weight patients (BMI 20-25), and 10 obese patients (BMI &#8805;35) for an in-depth analysis of immune cells using MultiOmyx&#8482;, an immunofluorescence (IF) multiplexing assay. After multiplexing FFPE sections with a custom panel of 13 immuno-oncology biomarkers, images were analyzed by applying the deep-learning based cell classification platform NeoLYTX.For the analysis of response to chemotherapy we used a DIO mouse model in which mice were fed a low-fat diet (LFD) <i>vs<\/i> high-fat diet (HFD) and then injected with ID8-Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> cells to establish tumor burden. Mice bearing equivalent tumor burden were treated with weight-adjusted standard of care chemotherapy. After sacrifice, remaining tumor burden was evaluated by quantitative fluorescence imaging.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results <\/b>We found that the mean M1\/M2 ratio in obese OvCa patients was nearly half (ratio=0.16) compared to patients who were normal weight (ratio=0.29), consistent with our previously published mouse data. Quantitation of residual tumor burden in the mouse model showed significantly reduced efficacy of chemotherapy (i.e., greater remaining tumor burden) in HFD mice (n=11\/cohort). The M1\/M2 TAM ratio in these mouse tumors is now under evaluation.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> Our observations suggest that the negative impact of obesity on OvCa survival may be due in part to an increased M1\/M2 TAM ratio and reduced response to chemotherapy. These data will be key to a more detailed understanding of the contribution of host obesity to ovarian tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eca44204-7765-4ec3-9397-4feddf49cbf2\/@v03B8ZLR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-06 Imaging of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Chemotherapy response,Macrophages,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11800"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Juncker-Jensen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yueying Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tyvette S.

BM predominantly originate from primary lung, breast, and melanoma tumors with a 90% mortality rate within one year of diagnosis, posing a large unmet clinical need to identify novel therapies against BM. The goal of this work is to uncover the molecular factors that drive the formation of BM and investigate whether we can slow down and ultimately block BM formation.<br \/>METHODS: The Singh lab has generated a large in-house biobank of patient-derived BM cell lines that are established from BM patient tumor samples. We use these BM cell lines to generate murine orthotopic xenograft models of BM and interrogate the biological processes that lead to BM. These models have successfully recapitulated all the stages of their respective BM cascades and additionally captured a &#8220;pre-metastatic&#8221; population of BM cells that have just seeded the brains of mice before forming mature, clinically detectable tumors. Pre-metastatic cell populations are impossible to detect in human patients but represent a therapeutic window wherein metastasizing cells can be targeted and eradicated before establishing clinically detectable and difficult to treat brain tumors.<br \/>RESULTS: RNA sequencing of pre-metastatic BM cells revealed a unique deregulated transcriptomic profile that is specific to pre-metastatic cells despite the tumor of origin. Subsequent Connectivity Map analysis revealed compounds that we biologically characterized <i>in vitro <\/i>for selective anti-BMIC phenotypes. This effort led to a lead compound that exhibits anti-BM activity <i>in vitro<\/i>, while remaining ineffective against normal brain cell controls. Preliminary <i>in vivo<\/i> work has shown that following both orthotopic and intracardiac injection of BM cells, treatment with this lead compound reduces the tumor burden compared to mice being treated by a vehicle control, while providing a significant survival advantage. Ongoing mechanistic investigations aim to delineate the protein target of this compound in the context of the observed selective anti-BM phenotype.<br \/>CONCLUSION: Identification of novel small molecules that target premetastatic BM cells could slow or prevent the formation of BM and dramatically improve the prognosis of at-risk cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/22662361-2a73-470d-b829-7ab8ca65a2c4\/@n03B8ZLS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Small molecule drugs,Xenografts,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11806"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Agata Kieliszek<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Blessing Bassey-Archibong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chitra Venugopal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheila Singh<\/i><\/presenter>.

In most high-risk neuroblastoma patients, tumor cells have disseminated to the bone marrow.<br \/><b>Problem Statement and Aim: <\/b>However, the bone marrow, as a key regulator of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cell quiescence, is a frequent site of dissemination not only of neuroblastoma but also of other solid cancers such as breast and prostate cancer. Still, comprehensive single-cell analyses of bone marrow metastases, i.e. disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and cells of their microenvironment, have not yet been undertaken. Herein, we aimed to capture tumor heterogeneity and investigate microenvironmental changes in a solid cancer with bone marrow involvement.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To that end, we applied a multi-omics data mining approach to define a multiplex imaging panel and designed DeepFLEX, a computational pipeline for subsequent multiplex image analysis. Thereby, we obtained a single-cell map of over 35,000 DTCs and cells of their microenvironment in the metastatic bone marrow niche. In addition, we independently profiled the transcriptome of 38 patients with and without bone marrow metastasis.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We revealed vast diversity among DTCs and suggest that FAIM2 can act as a complementary marker to capture DTC heterogeneity. However, DTCs in this study mainly expressed markers of the adrenergic lineage, such as GD2, but did not show a mesenchymal phenotype.

Most of HNSCC patients present with metastatic disease for which the survival rates for which remain low. Hypoxia serves as a bad prognostic factor in HNSCC correlating with worse survival and resistance to radiotherapy. We aimed to discover novel targets in metastatic HNSCC utilizing a unique collection of matched sets of cell lines derived from primary tumors and their respective metastatic sites. We carried out expression profiling across the lines to reveal potential common changes in gene expression between the cells derived from primary and metastatic sites in each patient as well as between normoxia and hypoxia. This analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression between the described conditions. Interestingly, beta defensin 2 was one of the genes that came up as overexpressed in metastasis as well as in cells cultured in hypoxia. Beta defensins are small cationic peptides that belong to the innate immune system and exhibit anti-microbial and anti-viral activities. Few studies reported their abnormal expression patterns in various cancers including HNSCC. While various novel anti-cancer therapies are currently being developed, early diagnosis remains one of the biggest challenges in cancer research. A discovery of soluble serum factors that can reliably detect the presence of primary or metastatic disease would serve as an extremely valuable tool in defining diagnosis and prognosis, predicting the response to treatment, and monitoring disease progression. We hypothesized the beta defensin 2 can serve as a serum biomarker of hypoxia and metastasis in HNSCC patients. Utilizing a commercial ELISA kit developed to detect and quantify levels of beta-defensin in human sera, we demonstrated that media collected from cell lines derived from metastases contained higher levels of beta-defensin compared to the cell lines derived from the primary tumors. Moreover, sera from HNSCC patients showed higher levels of beta defensin compared to the normal controls. As a next step we tested sera samples from 40 HNSCC patients out of which 20 had lymph node metastasis and 20 did not. While these data are still under analysis, preliminary results suggest that higher concentrations of beta-defensin correlate with the presence of lymph node metastasis in HNSCC patients. Utilizing 2 large chemical libraries that together contain about 4000 FDA approved drugs we performed high through put screening of the HNSCC lines described above in order to discover new drugs targeting head and neck cancer including drugs that target selectively metastatic cells compared to their primary tumor counterparts. Interestingly, many of the metastasis-specific drugs were antibiotics. Together with the findings described above, this data clearly suggests a connection between patient microbiome and the metastatic process in HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Microbiome,Drug-discovery screen,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11808"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Kondratyev<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Pesic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Dvorkin-Sheva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianne Koritzinsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bradly G.

Increasing evidence indicates that tumor development and metastases are not solely driven by genetic alterations but also the tumor microenvironment which is associated with changes in metabolic processes. While many studies show the importance of gene expression profiling in cancer progression, little is known about how this correlates with altered lipid metabolism at metastatic sites within the peritoneal cavity. NanoString nCounter provides specific and sensitive genetic profiling data identifying up to 800 genes simultaneously from small amounts of RNA. For biomolecule analysis, MSI is a powerful tool as it enables the rapid identification of phenotype-dependent MS signatures from tissues with little sample preparation. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of secondary tumors at different metastatic sites compared to the primary tumors using a combination of immunohistochemistry, NanoString analysis and Desorption Electrospray Ionization (DESI) MSI.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>12 fresh-frozen human colorectal adenocarcinoma and metastases samples were cut into 12&#956;m sections. DESI-MSI (Xevo G2-XS, Waters) was performed in both polarities with 50&#956;m spatial resolution. SCiLS Lab (Bruker) software were used for data analysis.<b> <\/b>Histologically-stained (H&#38;E) adjacent sections were used for microscopy. For genomic analysis, RNA was extracted using AllPrep DNA\/RNA micro kit from 20&#956;m sections. Following this, RNA abundance was measured using Qubit fluorimeter. Lastly, mRNA hybridisation, detection and scanning was performed on a NanoString nCounter mRNA Gene Expression system and analysed using nSolver 4.0 software.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>H&#38;E staining allowed the visualisation of different tissue histopathologies. These differences are echoed in selected DESI-MSI ion images. DESI spectra from distinct regions of the tissue show differences in biomolecule expression especially for phospholipids (<i>m\/z<\/i> 600-900). Ions such as <i>m\/z<\/i> 812 correlated with the non-cancerous region whereas others such as <i>m\/z<\/i> 861 were only observed in the cancerous regions of the tissue. Gene expression analysis showed concordance between primary and metastatic tumors such as in RAS\/RAF genes. Others, such as IL-6 expression was seen to upregulated in the metastatic sites compared to the primary tumor. Multivariate analysis enabled identification of biomolecules representative of different tissue phenotypes, with the data showing putative MS biomarkers associated with genetic mutations.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Results confirmed the advantage of the combined techniques to reveal spatial correlations between changes in lipid metabolism, tumor heterogeneity and gene expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6e3e6f79-ecdb-4ee2-b89e-03cdb5d7fb09\/@n03B8ZLS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression,Lipid metabolism,Mass spectrometry,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11809"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yasmin Shanneik<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emrys Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michal Smiga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bipasha Chakrabarty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omer Aziz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Pringle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaye Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam McMahon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Increased frequency of cervical lymph node metastases (LNM) is well recognized in pediatric PTC, including pediatric cases following the Chernobyl accident. We recently leveraged the collection of fresh-frozen tumor tissues from the Chernobyl Tissue Bank to conduct a genomic landscape analysis of 440 cases of PTC that provided new insights into radiation-related molecular characteristics of PTC occurring after the accident (Morton et al., Science 2021). Here, we extend that study to conduct a genomic landscape analysis of LNMs for a subset of 48 PTC cases to investigate the specific genomic alterations occurring in LNM. The analysis set comprised 144 samples, including fresh-frozen treatment-na&#239;ve primary and LNM PTC tumor samples as well as matched normal tissue or blood.<br \/>Overall, the mutational load was highly concordant between primary and metastatic PTC. On average, 50% of somatic single nucleotide variants and 97% structural variants were shared between primary and metastatic PTCs. In contrast, the burden of somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) between primary tumor and LNM pairs was less concordant, particularly for copy number gains, whereas most of the copy number loss was found to be shared between matched pairs. PTC is usually driven by one driver mutation, most often involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. All driver mutations were shared between primary and metastatic PTC and were clonal; thus, no additional driver mutations were detected in metastatic PTC. Notably, however, the matched pairs in this study disproportionately had fusion drivers (77%), whereas only 23% of the drivers were <i>BRAF V600E<\/i> and none were <i>RAS<\/i> mutations. Transcriptome analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in metastatic PTC compared to primary PTC; three-quarters of the DEGs were overexpressed in metastatic PTC. Half of the LNM overexpressed DEGs were members of the HOXC family, which has been linked with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer progression. There was also reduced expression in LNM for the DLX family, which relates to TGF-beta signaling. Our findings did not reveal a relationship between radiation dose and expression profiles in the LNM, comparable to our findings for the primary PTCs. We still observe that the efficiency of the radiation-induced PTC is paramount and subsequent events are directly related to the drivers in the MAPK pathway. For the cervical LNMs, we observed expression profiles not observed in the primary PTC that could give new insights into PTC local metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d59c4b7-7af8-4eeb-be4d-e35cf2267da3\/@n03B8ZLS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Tumor metastases,Molecular epidemiology,Radiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11810"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Olivia W.

A model of sequential acquisition of divergent somatic mutations is insufficient to explain metastasis. Liver metastasis (LM) occurs frequently and is associated with a poor prognosis and reduced therapy response in several cancers, including in patients with melanoma and lung cancer. To identify drivers of metastatic niches, we used a syngeneic mouse melanoma model which recapitulates genomic, metastatic and therapy response patterns seen in patients. We performed a large-scale <i>in vivo<\/i> CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen and identified perturbations that promote LM, but not primary tumor growth or metastasis to other organs (e.g. lung). The &#8220;top hit&#8221; in this screen associated with LM was loss <i>Pip4k2c<\/i>. We generated <i>Pip4k2c<sup>KO<\/sup><\/i> cells and show that in otherwise isogenic melanoma cell lines, loss of <i>Pip4k2c<\/i> led to increased baseline and insulin-induced activation of the PI3K\/AKT pathway, and increased invasive capacity. Rescuing <i>Pip4k2c<sup>KO<\/sup><\/i> with full-length (<i>Pip4k2c<sup>Rec<\/sup><\/i>) or allosteric domain deficient (<i>Pip4k2c<sup>AD<\/sup><\/i>) <i>Pip4k2c<\/i> ORFs, we show that hyperactivation of the PI3K\/AKT pathway in is mediated by loss of the allosteric domain function, and not loss of the kinase domain of <i>Pip4k2c<\/i>. Treatment with different PI3K inhibitors effectively abrogated the pathway, but was partly bypassed in the presence of insulin in <i>Pip4k2c<sup>KO<\/sup><\/i> and <i>Pip4k2c<sup>AD<\/sup><\/i>, but not parental or <i>Pip4k2c<sup>Rec<\/sup><\/i> cells. Upon tail vein injection, <i>Pip4k2c<sup>KO<\/sup><\/i> cells produced a significantly increased LM burden compared to parental cells, and this effect was rescued in <i>Pip4k2c<sup>Rec<\/sup><\/i> but not <i>Pip4k2c<sup>AD<\/sup><\/i>, further affirming that loss of allosteric domain was required for this phenotype. We reasoned that <i>Pip4k2c<sup>KO<\/sup><\/i> cells preferentially colonized the liver by co-opting the insulin-rich milieu in this organ. To test this, we used shRNA targeted against the insulin receptor (<i>Insr<\/i>) generated <i>Pip4k2c<sup>KO<\/sup>\/Insr<sup>shIR<\/sup> <\/i>and showed that Insr was required but not sufficient to enhance LM burden. Given the promising <i>in vitro<\/i> activity of PI3K inhibitors, we next tested whether these could abrogate LM <i>in vivo<\/i>. Surprisingly, we found a substantial increase in LM burden in mice with <i>Pip4k2c<sup>KO<\/sup><\/i>-bearing LM treated with PI3K inhibition compared to vehicle treated animals. We show that this paradoxical observation was due to host-mediated increased in glucose and insulin in response to PI3K inhibitor, which promoted a forward loop of increased liver metastasis. Breaking this loop with either ketogenic diet or treatment with a SGLT2 inhibitor in turn rescued increased these host responses and resulted in reduced LM burden in combination with PI3K inhibition. In summary, we identify a novel mechanism of metastatic liver organotropism and pharmacological and dietary combinations to reduced liver metastatic burden. Given the expanding use of PI3K inhibitors, our findings may have important clinical implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cd3c9452-5210-462d-bad8-b0dafeb41edd\/@n03B8ZLS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Malignant melanoma,Therapy resistance,Kinases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11812"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meri Rogava<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johannes C.

When it is localized to the kidney, it is often cured with surgical resection or thermal ablation. One quarter of the patients have evidence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and in this setting ccRCC still is a highly lethal disease with few effective treatment options. In this study we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize tumor cell clonality, metastatic signatures and the tumor microenvironment in ccRCC at the single-cell level.<br \/><b>Methodological approach: <\/b>Here we took advantage of fresh patient samples that included treatment-naive primary tumor tissue, matched adjacent normal kidney tissue, as well as tumor samples collected from patients with bone metastases.

Metastasis to the liver is specifically increased in PPBC compared to non-PPBC cases and likely contributes to the overall poor prognosis of PPBC. Our lab has previously shown that the rodent liver undergoes physiological remodeling after pregnancy, in a process reminiscent of weaning-induced mammary gland involution. Further, rodent models confirm that breast cancer cells delivered to the involuting liver grow more robustly than tumor cells delivered to nulliparous liver. Our rodent data suggest that weaning induced liver involution may be responsible for increased tumor cell seeding and ultimately higher rates of liver metastasis observed in women diagnosed with PPBC. Since weaning-induced liver involution is a recently recognized physiology, little is known of its molecular underpinnings. Here we employ RNA-seq of murine livers to better understand how reproductive status influences liver physiology with a focus on exploring the pro-metastatic niche formed after weaning.<br \/><b>Study design:<\/b> Livers were isolated from age-matched mice at the following reproductive time points: nulliparous (never pregnant), lactation, involution days 2, 4, 6, and 8, and fully regressed (4 weeks post-wean) and flash frozen for RNA isolation (n=3-6 mice per group). RNA-seq was utilized to identify gene expression differences between reproductive groups. We employed single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGESA) to identify key pathways modulated by reproductive state.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identify clear reproductive control of liver physiology. We find increases in proliferation, MTORC1, and anabolic metabolism pathways during lactation when compared to any other reproductive state. In the transition from lactation to involution, we find increases in apoptotic pathways, and a switch to catabolic metabolism. Correspondingly, during involution we see enrichment in pro-cancer pathways including increased TGF&#946; signaling, Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition, and Inflammatory Responses Hallmark Pathways. Within the immune signatures changes of involution, we observe myeloid-derived cell signatures including enrichment in M2 associated genes, and increases in cytotoxic and helper T cell signatures that parallels a signature for disease-specific T cell exhaustion.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> This work highlights novel regulation of liver physiology by reproductive state, and finds pathways regulated during the natural physiological process of involution that have been previously identified as contributing to metastatic niches. This study has the potential to identify new targets for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer liver metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f2a6b559-698a-4257-816b-4c1c5ea04045\/@n03B8ZLS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-10 Premetastatic niche,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Liver,Metastatic potential,RNA-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11814"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michelle K.

Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) occur in most patients with advanced melanoma and are challenging to treat. Our understanding of the treatment-na&#239;ve landscape of MBM is still rudimentary, and there are no site-specific molecular therapies available. To gain comprehensive insights into the niche-specific biology of MBM, we performed multi-modal profiling of fresh and frozen samples using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell TCR-seq, single-nuclei RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptional profiling. We evolved single-nucleus RNA-seq processing methods to enable profiling of minute amounts of archival, frozen specimens and compared data quality and structure between matched fresh and frozen MBM. We curated a treatment-na&#239;ve single-transcriptome atlas of MBM, collected either fresh samples over 1 year or profiled frozen samples dating back more than 15 years, and compared these samples to extracranial melanoma metastases (ECMM). In total, we profiled 25 samples with more than 114,000 transcriptomes. We identified more than 20 different cell types, including diverse tumor-infiltrating T-cell subsets and rare dendritic cell types, and tissue-specific cell types, such as activated microglia. Tumor cells in MBM showed an increase in copy number alterations (CNAs) compared to ECMM, which we validated using an external dataset of whole exome sequencing (WES) data including both MBM and ECMM. MBM-derived tumor cells show enrichment of genes involved in neuronal development and function, and site-specific metabolic programs (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation). Comparison with an external bulk RNA-seq dataset validated enriched key genes in MBM and ECMM as putative dependencies. We recovered cell-cell interactions between tumor and brain-resident cells involved in brain development, homeostasis, and disease. Similar to ECMM, the tumor microenvironment of MBM contained CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells across a spectrum of differentiation, exhaustion and expansion, which was associated with loss of <i>TCF7 <\/i>expression and adoption of a <i>TOX<\/i><sup>+<\/sup> cell state. CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells included T regulatory, T helper and T follicular-helper-like expression profiles. Plasma cells showed spatially localized expansion and limited heterogeneity. Myeloid cells largely adopted pro-tumorigenic cell states, including microglia, the brain-resident myeloid cells, which showed an activation trajectory characterized by expression of <i>SPP1 <\/i>(osteopontin). Spatial transcriptional analysis revealed restricted expression of antigen presentation genes with only a subset of these locations showing a type I interferon response. In summary, this work presents a multi-modal single-cell approach to dissect and compare the landscape of treatment-na&#239;ve MBM and ECMM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/92659757-757e-42ee-b53a-b788fccb7ee2\/@o03B8ZLT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Brain metastasis,Single cell,Tumor biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11815"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Johannes C.

To date, no studies have systematically analyzed the transcriptomic similarity of metastatic cancers to their target tissues in a genome wide manner. Here, we ask if the overall gene expression of primary and metastatic tumors is closer to their tissue of origin or closer to their target tissue? Next, we aim to identify the key pathways in metastatic tumors whose gene expression becomes markedly closer to their target than primary tissue of origin.<br \/><b><i>Methods: <\/i><\/b>We analyzed the expression profiles of: (a) primary tumors of 9 cancer types, which have metastasized to the liver, lung, or brain (TCGA data, n = 306), (b) metastatic tumors of 12 cancer types (MET500 collection, n = 194) and (c) their origin and target normal tissue samples (GTEx, n = 5,663). We computed the similarity (Euclidean distance) between the expression profiles of the tumors (either primary or metastasis) to the mean expression of their corresponding normal tissue of origin and target tissues, termed their transcriptomic distance (TD). For each tumor sample&#8217;s expression profile (either primary tumor or metastasis), we compute the ratio of its TD to the tissue of origin over its TD to the target tissue to get its TD ratio.<br \/><b><i>Results: <\/i><\/b>1) We find that while most primary tumors are more similar to the tissue of origin than to the target tissues, there is a shift in expression patterns in metastatic tumors towards their target.<br \/>2) Across cancer types that metastasize to the liver, cell cycle and growth pathways are significantly transcriptomically closer to the tissue of origin; while the expression of pathways related to more specialized liver cellular functions, such as coagulation and bile acid metabolism are becoming significantly closer to the liver.<br \/>3) We tested our key findings by analyzing a matched cohort of primary breast cancers and metastasis samples, reassuringly finding that they overall recapitulate the key results emerging from the non-matched analysis. The key pathways altered when metastasizing to four target tissues (liver, lung, ovary, skin) are adipogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, coagulation, xenobiotic metabolism, and bile acid metabolism.<br \/><b><i>Conclusions: <\/i><\/b>Quite surprisingly, this the first systematic analysis comparing the landscape of primary and metastatic transcriptional alterations of the same cancer type, providing a genome wide view of how cancers adapt to new environments during metastasis. The systematic identification of the specific pathways whose expression shifts towards the target tissues in metastatic tumors provides important leads to their potential targeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/134b12f0-570d-4efa-adc1-6a7e8b5f0993\/@o03B8ZLT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Bioinformatics,Gene expression analysis,Tumor metastases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11816"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Camilo Calvo-Alcañiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Padma S.

The X-chromosome <i>RBM10<\/i> gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that modulates transcriptome-wide cassette exon splicing. Truncation and missense <i>RBM10<\/i> mutations are enriched (11%) in non-anaplastic thyroid cancers of patients who died of metastatic disease. MSK-MET, an integrated pan-cancer cohort of tumor genomic and clinical outcome data showed <i>RBM10 <\/i>alterations associate with metastatic burden in thyroid cancer. Within the MSK-IMPACT thyroid cancer cohort, 44% of <i>RBM10<\/i> alterations co-occur with <i>RAS<\/i> mutations. We developed a murine <i>Rbm10<\/i> floxed allele, which results in a non-functional transcript. Thyroid-specific <i>Rbm10<\/i> inactivation through <i>Tpo-Cre<\/i> did not induce a phenotype. When crossed with <i>FR-Hras<sup>G12V<\/sup><\/i> mice, which upon recombination generate endogenous expression of Hras<sup>G12V<\/sup>, <i>Hras\/Rbm10<\/i> mice developed thyroid cancers, ~ 20% of which were metastatic to lung. Cell lines derived from these tumors showed high penetrance of lung metastases after tail vein or orthotopic implantation into the thyroid. We identified splicing targets of RBM10 by high depth RNAseq of 5 isogenic human thyroid cancer cell lines (2 RBM10-null with dox-induced RBM10; 3 RBM10 WT with RBM10 shRNA). The common abnormalities associated with RBM10 loss were exon inclusion events. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of global transcriptomes in RBM10 isogenic human thyroid cancer cell lines showed enrichment in pro-migratory, aberrant integrin and RHO\/RAC signaling expression signatures. Enriched GO analysis confined to genes subject to aberrant splicing by RBM10 loss extended these findings, with the top terms being cell adhesion, cytoskeleton, cadherin and integrin binding. RBM10 loss was associated with increased cell migration velocity <i>in vitro<\/i> as measured by time lapse imaging. Key cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix genes subject to exon inclusion events included vinculin (VCL), tenascin C (TNC), CD44, fibronectin (FN1) and tropomyosin 1 (TPM1). Isoform-specific knockdown of the VCL splice inclusion cassette exon that leads to illegitimate expression of metavinculin (mVCL) reduced cell migration, whereas isoform-specific knockdown of TNC and CD44 exon inclusion events<i> <\/i>reduced cell invasiveness <i>in vitro<\/i>. Rho GTPases transduce signals from the ECM to integrin receptors to regulate cell adhesion, migration, and invasiveness. Consistent with this, RBM10 overexpression in RBM10 null cells reduced RAC1-GTP levels. Finally, <i>RBM10<\/i> re-expression in <i>RBM10<\/i> null cells reversed metastatic competency <i>in vivo. <\/i>In conclusion, <i>RBM10<\/i> loss alters the ratio of cassette exon inclusion events in a subset of transcripts that regulate interactions between the ECM and the cytoskeleton, leading to RHO\/RAC activation and governing a process favoring increased cell movement and metastatic competence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f2b92b3-d9ee-401e-944f-e00b4ddf5359\/@o03B8ZLT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,RBM10 gene, Cassette exon splicing,Extracellular matrix, Cytoskeleton,  Rho\/Rac signaling.,cell migration, cell invasion, Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11817"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gnana P.

Lymph node metastases (LNM) play a central role in the staging of CRC patients since they are currently viewed as the gateway to distant metastases. However, in recent years additional forms of locoregional spread with varying prognostic impact have been identified, with tumor deposits (TD) having significantly more impact than LNM. The biological explanation for the difference in prognostic impact between LNM and TD is lacking, while this is essential for a more comprehensive understanding of the role of these biomarkers CRC spread. Therefore, in this study, shotgun proteomics were used to compare the biological phenotype of TD and LNM.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> From 12 CRC patients, one TD and one LNM were included for paired protein analyses. Proteins were isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue after which a filter aided sample preparation method was performed. Then, the samples were analyzed by liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry, and after data handling and filtering, 5578 differentially expressed proteins were used for downstream analyses. Differences in expression were visualized using heatmaps and volcano plots, and enrichment analyses as well as gene set enrichment was performed. All analyses were performed using R version 4.1.2.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among the main findings was that the proteins ASPN, MRC2, SPON1, MXRA5, BGN, LUM, and PLOD2 were overexpressed in TD. These proteins play a role in stimulating pro-tumorigenic processes such as migration, invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. For the enrichment analyses all proteins with a Fold change of less than -1 and more than 1 were included. Enrichment analyses using the KEGG pathways showed more immune activity in the LNM, with upregulated B-cell and T-cell signaling (p&#60;0.001), while TD showed more interaction with the extracellular matrix in the form of proteoglycans, focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction (p&#60;0.01). In addition, when hallmarks from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) were used for the enrichment analyses, TD showed the hallmark of epithelial mesenchymal transition (p &#60;0.005).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This study shows that TD have a more aggressive and invasive phenotype compared to LNM on protein level. TD had a higher expression of proteins that promote pro-tumorigenic processes and a more extensive interaction with the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, the hallmark of epithelial mesenchymal transition is enriched in TD compared to LNM. These findings form a possible explanation for the strong prognostic impact of TD, and give insight into the heterogeneity of different modes of locoregional spread in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b21f8e8e-f201-487a-a187-e51d5f9bbfe4\/@o03B8ZLT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Invasion,Lymph node metastasis,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11818"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nelleke P.

There has been little change in the treatment paradigm for this disease and new targeted therapies are an urgent and unmet clinical need. Previously, we showed that the epigenetic regulators, histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and 2) are key mediators of OS progression and lung metastasis and that the HDAC1\/2 selective inhibitor (romidepsin) significantly prevented OS lung metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>. Yet, inhibition of HDACs by romidepsin has noted toxicities in humans and here we define the potential mechanisms through which HDAC1\/2 mediate their effects in a bid to identify additional therapeutic targets.<br \/>Methods: Human OS cell lines were treated with vehicle or romidepsin for 24h before undergoing RNA\/protein isolation for microarray\/proteomics to identify differentially regulated genes. Standard siRNA, proliferation, migration and molecular analyses were preformed to investigate the role of candidate genes in OS malignant behavior.<br \/>Results: Microarray\/proteomics analyses on romidepsin treated OS cells identified neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a membrane bound co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor, to be highly downregulated in response to romidepsin; (&#60;70% compared to vehicle in multiple OS cell lines). NRP1 knockdown (siRNA) led to reduced cell proliferation and interestingly, increased cell migration. Further, a phosphokinase array revealed increased phosphorylation in eNOS, ERK 1\/2 and &#946;-catenin in NRP1 knockdown cells that is consistent with a role for NRP1 in regulating OS migration. Based on this data, we hypothesize that NRP1 is a significant regulator of OS proliferation and migration. Our next steps will be to dissect the role of NRP1 silencing in OS invasion and metastasis<i>in vivo <\/i>and the potential role of NRP1 in OS differentiation.<br \/>Conclusions: HDAC1\/2 contributes to OS growth potentially via the upregulation of NRP1, a therapeutically actionable target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f1314605-bad4-4dc8-9db8-caaaa1c63b9c\/@o03B8ZLT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Neuropilins,Metastasis,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11819"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Niveditha Nerlakanti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Mcguire<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Damon Reed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Conor C.

However, the downstream activity generated by AR-V7 in tissue has not been shown. Whether AR-V7 is active in tissue or whether AR-V7 is a non-functioning biomarker with full-length AR is not known. To address this question, we constructed a tissue microarray (TMA) of 56 metastases from 27 patients with CRPC to analyze spatial gene expression using the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler. Immunostaining was performed to define epithelial, vascular, and stromal compartments. The stained tissues were then hybridized with barcoded tagged oligonucleotides targeting 2093 unique genes, which included those representing AR, AR-V cryptic exons, AR and neuroendocrine activity, and immune cell markers. One 500 um region of interest (ROI) was assessed per tissue core (approximately 1200 cells). A sequential section from the same TMA was then stained with AR-V7 and AR-C-terminal specific antibodies. ROIs for RNA and protein were selected to be similar between slides. In addition to DSP, each metastasis was assessed by RNA-seq on the bulk tissue.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The most differentially expressed genes (FDR&#60;0.05) based on association with AR-V7 staining were known downstream AR regulated genes including KLK2 and 3, FKBP5, NKX3.1, TMPRSS2, FASN, and TARP. Additionally, genes associated with proliferation and stemness, e.g., POLB, KRT1, SOX2, were significantly expressed. Since 93% of patients were on ADT at time of tissue collection and over 80% also had been treated with either abiraterone or enzalutamide, the increase in AR downstream genes would not be expected to occur from ligand activation of AR-FL. We also have previously shown that knock-down of AR-V7 in LNCaP95 cells results in loss of AR binding to AREs. In these metastases, then, activation of AR downstream genes would be a result of AR-V7 nuclear transport of AR-FL through AR-V7\/AR-FL heterodimers or transcriptional activation by AR-V7 homodimers. Of further note, AR cryptic exons 1, 2, and 5 were also significantly expressed in AR-V7 positive ROIs (p&#60; 0.0001). RNA-seq intron\/exon junction reads were used to demonstrate that additional AR-Vs, most commonly AR-V9, were also expressed in tissues positive for AR-V7, suggesting that AR splicing is a common event in CRPC. Finally, expression of neuroendocrine (NE) genes INSM1 and TUBB2 were not expressed in AR-V7 positive ROIs (negatively correlated, p&#60;0.001), indicating that AR-V7 and NE phenotypes cannot co-exist in the same cell.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> AR-V7 continues to drive prostate cancer through activation of the AR-cistrome. Its expression is heterogenous in metastases along with NE cells, suggesting that in the presence of AR-V7 and NE markers, therapy needs to be directed at the N-terminus of AR and NE components.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/15aebb3d-f9fc-4c90-8dcc-594bcf343e13\/@o03B8ZLT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Splice variants,Tumor metastases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11820"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cynthia C.

Currently there are limited targeted treatment options for patients, especially for women with high metastatic tumor burden. In order to improve patient outcomes, we have aimed to identify and characterize kinases that may regulate the steps of metastasis in HGSC. Kinases in particular serve as actionable targets because we can design inhibitors of the kinases and their ligands. Several kinases, such as tyrosine kinases and aurora kinases, have previously been implicated in ovarian cancer and seem to influence tumor cell metastasis. Our lab performed a functional genomic screen on 719 kinases in a tumor cell attachment and proliferation assay. In this screen, we cultured primary fibroblasts from patient omentum and plated them on top of a collagen and fibronectin matrix, to mimic the tumor microenvironment. We used siRNA transfection reagents, which were plated atop the fibroblasts along with GFP-labeled ovarian cancer cells that were then incubated with the other cell layers for 72 hours. Based on the florescence intensities, we calculated median average deviations (MAD) values normalized to controls to be a measure of ovarian cancer cell attachment and proliferation. This screen was replicated in 3 ovarian cancer cell lines, including OVCAR8, ES2, and A2780, across 9 panels for 2 libraries. Both libraries had 2 distinct siRNAs for each kinase, in total 4 siRNAs per kinase. From this initial screen, we have identified 20 candidate kinases to validate based on having significantly negative MAD values in at least two cells lines in the screen. Candidate kinases have been validated by knock-down in two ovarian cancer cell lines, ES2 and OVCAR8, and assessed on their ability to migrate in a wound-healing assay. The top kinases will be further studied for their ability to regulate the steps of tumor cell metastasis and the mechanisms that allow them to promote metastasis. Our study aims to identify actionable targets that influence these steps of metastasis, so we can develop drugs that target metastatic tumors and serve as maintenance therapies to help prevent further metastasis, mediate chemoresistance, and improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e0af9edb-e0cf-447f-8127-0b372b749f3d\/@o03B8ZLT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Kinases,Migration,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11821"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"e413886a-ad70-4d0a-b976-2f58dc5f3897","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e413886a-ad70-4d0a-b976-2f58dc5f3897\/@o03B8ZLT\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emilee Nicole Kotnik<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Lomonosova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Wilke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Longmore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine C.

From the three Ovo-like family genes identified in mammals, Ovol-like1 (Ovol1) and Ovol-like2 (Ovol2) are the most studied members with multiple reports pinpointing relevant roles in development and disease. In cancer, one of the hallmarks of invasive carcinoma involves the loss of E-cadherin expression by the repression of SNAG transcription factors. Interestingly, contrary to the other SNAG domain family members the OVO-like genes regulate epithelial cell fate. We performed data analysis in breast cancer cell lines and patient data obtained from GEO, CCLE, TCGA and METABRIC to assess the potential of the OVO-like genes as relevant regulators of gene expression in breast carcinoma. In addition, we stablished breast cancer models with inducible expression or repression of the OVO-like genes. We also analyzed the cellular systems we generated using na&#239;ve high-throughput methods such as RNA-Seq. Likewise, we studied the effect of OVO-like genes on tumor progression and metastasis using inducible expression systems in both xenograft and syngeneic breast cancer models. We observed that Ovol1 and Ovol2 are constitutively expressed in human breast cancer cell lines, and they are upregulated due to chromosomal gains in breast cancer patients. We observed how the introduction of Ovol1 and Ovol2 into mesenchymal-like breast cancer cell lines modified their transcriptome in a way that promoted expression of epithelial marker genes (e.g., Amphiregulin) and downregulated mesenchymal markers (e.g., Vimentin). In addition, introducing Ovo-like genes in mesenchymal-like cells greatly affected their viability and function. Surprisingly, we observed a similar effect by downregulating the Ovo-like genes in epithelial-like cells. We propose a model where a common epigenetic machinery is shared between structurally related transcription factors with opposing effects, such as OVO-like proteins and other SNAG-containing transcription factors, such as Snail and Slug, such that the abundance of the transcription factors and their co-repressors defines the state of the system as either epithelial or mesenchymal.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b5be8b1f-0902-4f23-b6ed-2037fa3d7d7c\/@o03B8ZLT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),Metastasis,Transcriptional regulation,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11845"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Diana Drago Garcia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yosef Yarden<\/i><\/presenter>.

About 90% of all cancer-related deaths are due to the development of metastatic sites in the body. 40-50% of colorectal cancer patients develop metastasis at some point during their fight with the disease. Understanding the mechanism of metastasis in colorectal cancer is vital. Metastasis is a multistep process; anchorage-independent survival after intravasation of cells from the primary tumor site is a crucial step. In our lab, we have previously demonstrated that MUC13 plays an essential role in the CRC progression by modulating anti-apoptotic pathways and survival proteins expression. Under anchorage-independent growth conditions, we have identified that MUC13, in correspondence with YAP1, is the key upregulated protein and is responsible for increased survival. Isogenic CRC cell lines SW480 (non-metastatic) and SW620 (metastatic) on low adherence growth conditions are applied in these studies. In addition, lentiviral transduced stable overexpression and knockdown cell lines were generated for MUC13 and YAP1 mechanistic studies. The overexpression of MUC13 in non-metastatic SW480 cells (low MUC13 expressing) increased anchorage-independent survival and enhanced tumorigenesis compared to SW480+Vector cells, contrary results were found upon MUC13 knockdown in SW620 cells (high MUC13 expressing). In vitro results were recapitulated in the in vivo mouse model system and human CRC tissues. In Proximity Ligation Assays (PLA), we found an increased nuclear localization of the survival complex YAP1\/&#946;-catenin in MUC13 overexpressing cells. In contrast, MUC13 knockdown resulted to the lower aboudance of survival complex in the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation validates the protein-protein interaction between MUC13 and YAP1. YAP1 knockdown in MUC13 overexpressing cells showed a decrease in survival, indicating the necessary functional complex formation between MUC13 and YAP1. MUC13 and YAP1 expression in human CRC tissue were highest at Stage II. However, YAP1 expression increased when MUC13 was observed in the nucleus. This supports the notion that MUC13 is critical in enhancing CRC metastasis through molecular interaction with YAP1. For the first time, this study demonstrates complex formation between MUC13 and YAP1 and defines their role in CRC progression and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3394f9de-8883-482a-a942-090bbb7ac5d3\/@p03B8ZLU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Anoikis,Metastasis,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11873"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyle Doxtater<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manish K.
