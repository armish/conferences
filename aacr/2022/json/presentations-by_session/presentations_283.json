The protein is mutated or upregulated in an array of cancers, including pancreatic and ovarian cancers, where it correlates with more aggressive and chemoresistant disease. Within the promoter of KRAS lies a G-rich region capable of forming the higher order non-canonical DNA structure, the G-quadruplex (G4). Stabilization of G4 formation in the mid-region of the KRAS promoter downregulates transcription and facilitates decreased growth and chemo-sensitization of pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells with aberrant KRAS signaling. Our collaborative team designed Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen (PPRH) hairpin oligonucleotides that establish Watson Crick bonds with the pyrimidine strand within the KRAS-mid-G4-forming region to enhance G4 formation, downregulate KRAS transcription and mediate an anti-proliferative effect. In particular, two PPRHs were designed to interact with the 3&#8217; and 5&#8217; ends of the G4-forming region, along with two correlating W:C, and one scramble, controls. The binding of these oligonucleotides to the G4-forming region was verified by gel electrophoresis, and the cell activity was examined <i>in vitro<\/i> both by luciferase and in pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells. Using a luciferase construct driven by the KRAS promoter, only the PPRHs, and none of the control oligonucleotides, significantly decreased activity. Cytotoxicity experiments in KRAS dependent and independent cell lines demonstrated that PPRHs, but not control oligonucleotides, selectively suppressed proliferation only in the dependent pancreatic and ovarian cancer cell lines. Correlation of the cytotoxic effects of these potential therapeutic PPRHs with transcriptional downregulation is under investigation. PPRH also demonstrated synergistic activity with a KRAS promoter selective G4-stabilizing compound in KRAS-dependent pancreatic cells, and sensitization to standard chemotherapeutic regimens is also being studied. These designed PPRH oligonucleotides selectively stabilize G4 formation within the KRAS mid promoter region, and represent an innovative approach both for G4-stabilization and KRAS modulation with potential for development into novel therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,G-quadruplex,Pancreatic and Ovarian,PPRH,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Alexandra Maria Psaras<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simonas Valiuska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronique Noe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos J.

Therefore, it is essential to expand our current knowledge of the biological processes that contribute to metastasis to guide the discovery of novel therapeutic modalities. The Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a mechanism for metastasis, which changes polarized epithelial cells into invasive mesenchymal cells. High expression of the Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) transcription factor is correlated to poor outcomes in cancer, including therapeutic resistance and EMT-mediated metastasis. ZEB1 has a predicted molecular weight of 125kDa; however, multiple groups have reported discrepancies in the observed molecular weight (approximately 190-250kDa). This has been attributed to dimerization mediated by post-translational modifications (PTMs). Therefore, we performed mass spectrometry and identified a novel PTM - K811 acetylation - that may regulate ZEB1 dimerization and function. To define the role of ZEB1 acetylation, we generated ZEB1 acetyl mimetic (K811Q) and deficient (K811R) mutants in a panel of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. We hypothesize that ZEB1 acetylation regulates dimerization and protein stability to promote lung adenocarcinoma progression and metastasis. We determined that the acetyl-deficient mutant (125kDa) exhibits a decreased half-life compared to WT and acetylated ZEB1, suggesting that disruption of acetylation hinders dimerization and protein stability. However, the acetyl-mimetic mutant (250kDa) protects ZEB1 from proteasomal degradation brought by the action of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1. siRNA-mediated silencing of SIAH1 increased the mRNA and protein levels of ZEB1 WT and both acetylation mutants. Importantly, silencing of SIAH1 markedly increased the half-life of 250kDa ZEB1 WT from 18.0hrs to 25.4hrs and acetyl-mimetic from 12.3hrs to 24.0hrs, as well as 125kDa ZEB1 acetyl-deficient from 9.7hrs to 18.3hrs. Although we determined that 250kDa ZEB1 is significantly more stable than 125kDa ZEB1, the increase in the stability by silencing SIAH1 contributes to ZEB1 acetyl-deficient binding at the promoter of its target genes <i>mir200c-141<\/i> and <i>SEMA3F<\/i>. 250kDa ZEB1 WT and acetyl-mimetic recruits the histone deacetylases (HDACs) containing the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, to promote lung adenocarcinoma invasion and metastasis compared to ZEB1 acetyl-deficient. We further established that the stability of ZEB1 is integral to promoting these mesenchymal features. Our results suggest that ZEB1_K811ac regulates its dimerization and stability to promote lung adenocarcinoma via EMT. Future studies are focused on understanding the role of ZEB1 protein stability to recruit NuRD co-repressor and subsequently mediate tumorigenesis and metastasis<i>.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Metastasis,Post-transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mabel G.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the central mediator of cellular responses to hypoxia and drives a transcriptional program with central roles in tumorigenesis. Clear cell renal cell cancers (ccRCC) exhibit the most direct and profound upregulation of the HIF pathway - through bi-allelic inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor, a ubiquitin ligase that targets HIF-alpha subunits for degradation under normal oxygenated conditions. HIF-alpha proteins are members of the bHLH-PAS family and interact with HIF-1beta (also known as ARNT) to form functional heterodimers binding chromatin. However, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), another bHLH-PAS protein that dimerises with HIF-1beta, is also up-regulated in ccRCC, raising the possibility of crosstalk between these two transcriptional pathways. Previous studies support an antagonistic relationship between HIF and AHR, with evidence of a context-dependent and gene-specific crosstalk. Here, we investigate the pan-genomic and precise relationship between the HIF and AHR transcription factors in ccRCC. Using immunoprecipitation, we show direct competition for HIF-1beta binding between the HIF-alpha and AHR proteins in renal cancer cell lines. Pan-genomic analysis of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, HIF-1beta and AHR chromatin binding by ChIP-seq analysis reveals a widespread competitive interaction between HIF and AHR. In RCC4 cells, this interaction is bidirectional, with induction of HIF leading to a reduction in AHR binding, while induction of AHR reduces binding of both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha to chromatin. However, this competition is diminished at sites bound by both HIF and AHR, indicating a cooperative interaction between the two transcription factors in cis. Thus, while the HIF-alpha and AHR proteins compete for the common binding partner HIF-1beta, they appear to form a cooperative interaction when bound to neighbouring sites on chromatin. Linking these findings to changes in gene expression by RNA-seq analysis, we show the global downstream effects of the competition between HIF and AHR, but also reveal a degree of overlap and cooperativity between their transcriptional programs. Furthermore, we provide evidence of this antagonistic relationship in ccRCC tumours (TCGA database), in which we observe a negative correlation between HIF and AHR target gene expression. These findings shed light on the complex crosstalk between the HIF and AHR transcriptional pathways, which encompasses both a widespread inhibitory interaction and specific cooperative events and highlight a role for AHR in modifying the HIF transcriptional output in ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia-inducible factor,Aryl hydrocarbon receptor,Chromatin binding analysis,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Véronique N.

Pol I is the most active RNA polymerase, and it comprises over 60% of transcriptional activity in cancer cells. The robust transcriptional activity, coupled with the high density of elongating Pol I transcription complexes on the rDNA, renders Pol I vulnerable to transcriptional blocks. In healthy cells, this type of transcriptional stress activates inhibitory downstream cascades such as the p53 pathway. However, cancer cells elude this regulatory mechanism to sustain high levels of growth. Further, oncogenic drivers upregulate Pol I activity and achieve abnormally high rates of ribosome biogenesis. This makes Pol I a highly relevant target for cancer therapeutics. Yet little is known about the stability and regulation of the enzyme complex and whether this knowledge can be used for therapeutic purposes. Our lab recently discovered a first-in-class small molecule, BMH-21, that inhibits Pol I transcription and induces the degradation of the catalytic subunit of Pol I, RPA194. We showed that the inducible degradation of RPA194 is cancer cell-specific, correlated with cell death, and is mediated by the proteasome system. A detailed understanding of the degradation process will provide essential knowledge about the stability of the Pol I complex and benefit therapeutic implementation of Pol I inhibitory strategies.<br \/>To identify the E3 ligases involved, we conducted a cell-based RNAi screen for ubiquitin pathway genes associated with RPA194 degradation. This screen identified a Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) complex as a promising candidate E3 ligase. We focused on validating the role of the identified F-box protein, FBXL14, in RPA194 degradation. To do this, we conducted knockout, knockdown, and overexpression analyses of FBXL14 in melanoma, osteosarcoma, breast cancer and chronic myelogenous leukemia cancer cell lines. We show here that both the basal expression of RPA194 and the BMH-21-induced degradation depend on FBXL14. The expression of FBXL14 significantly affected the half-life of RPA194. Knockdown of FBXL14 increases RPA194 turnover upon BMH-21 treatment, while its overexpression reduces RPA194 half-life. Using co-immunoprecipitation analyses, we demonstrate that FBXL14 interacts with RPA194 both in cell lines and <i>in vitro<\/i>. To investigate the correlation between RPA194 degradation and cell death, we analyzed how the expression of FBXL14 affects sensitivity to BMH-21 using cell growth, viability, and colony formation assays. We found that FBXL14 overexpression increased the sensitivity to the drug. Our results have revealed novel regulatory aspects of Pol I, showing that the stability of the catalytic subunit is controlled by the F-box protein FBXL14. We discuss the implications of these findings on Pol I transcription activity and its regulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-03 Mechanisms of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Small molecule drugs,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephanie Pitts<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hester Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenjun Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brittany Ford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald Hay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marikki Laiho<\/i><\/presenter>.

During hepatogenesis, an active NOTCH2 signal is required for specification of the cholangiocyte lineage, while hepatoblasts remaining in a Notch-off state contribute to the default hepatocyte lineage. Notch pathway activation has been reported in liver tumors, although Notch-related liver cancer mutations are rare. We identified a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma that is exceptionally sensitive to the inhibition of a JAG1-NOTCH2 signal in a mouse preclinical trial using 47 liver cancer PDX models.<br \/>Transcriptional profiling revealed that the sensitive models resemble a progenitor-like state. Highly selective therapeutic antibodies targeting either the JAG1 ligand or the NOTCH2 receptor triggered hepatocyte differentiation programs and tumor regressions.Single cell analyses revealed heterogeneous transcriptional states at baseline, some of which were profoundly perturbed upon Notch inhibition. Topic modeling combined with inference of transcription factor activities suggested the involvement of HNF4&#945; and C\/EBP&#945; in treatment induced changes. Through its target HES1, Notch signaling directly represses C\/EBP&#945; expression. Notch inhibition derepresses C\/EBP&#945; which then binds chromatin in cooperation with HNF4&#945;. We found that this cooperative binding results in expression of genes associated with mature hepatocyte activity, which was incompatible with tumor maintenance.<br \/>Importantly, we identify hallmarks to aid the identification of this relatively rare tumor type. We suggest that inducing cell states towards differentiated, less aggressive states, especially using targeted single-agent therapeutics, holds great promise for the treatment of certain tumors in the liver and, by extension, possibly in other progenitor-like cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Differentiation,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kerstin Seidel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Robert Piskol<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thi Thu Thao Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charisa Cottonham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Merchant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Siebel<\/i><\/presenter>.

Androgen Receptor (AR) mediated transcriptional program is central to normal prostate homeostasis and drives PCa growth and survival. Chromoplexy, a highly complex genomic architecture with several intra- and inter-chromosomal segments joined in a chain, is among the most prominent genetic alterations that drive both prostate cancer initiation and progression, and often involves sites of AR transcription. Previous studies have shown that AR induced, topoisomerase 2 beta (TOP2B) mediated double strand breaks were recombinogenic and led to <i>de novo<\/i> formation of <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> fusion gene, shedding light on the potential role of TOP2B in chromoplexy formation. However, the precise role of TOP2B in AR transcription was not well understood. Here, we hypothesize that TOP2B is recruited to resolve topological constraints arising during induction of AR transcriptional programs, and its catalytic activity is required to facilitate or maintain chromosomal interactions optimal for transcriptional induction. We performed Chromosomal Conformation Capture related techniques (3C and HiC) on LNCaP cells before and after androgen stimulation and observed an increase in chromatin interactions within 15kb from promoters of AR target genes upon androgen induction. These interactions depended on TOP2B, as TOP2B catalytic inhibition or knockdown reduced them significantly. Furthermore, TOP2B Hi-CHIP revealed that TOP2B is involved in key enhancer-promoter looping and in several interactions among gene body, enhancers, promoters of AR target genes, and nearby topological associated domain borders.<b> <\/b>We went on to isolate which steps during AR transcription induction required TOP2B by examining chromatin localization of the key factors, including AR, cohesin (SMC1A), CTCF, histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), and total and phosphorylated RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) using ChIP-seq. These experiments revealed that TOP2B was not required for AR binding nor for localization of H3K27ac marks. However, it was required for recruitment of cohesin to AR binding sites as well as to AR target gene promoters and gene bodies, for displacement of CTCF near AR target genes, and for localization and phosphorylation of RNAPII at AR target genes. These data nominate TOP2B as a key AR coactivator, assisting in the proper assembly of cohesin during transcription induction, and maintaining chromosomal interactions optimal for binding and activation of RNAPII.<b> <\/b>Intriguingly, sites of binding of TOP2B, as well as of cohesin, were highly associated with sites of chromoplexy complex rearrangements in human prostate cancers. Taken together, this work elucidates the role of TOP2B in AR-induced transcription, and implicates its involvement in chromoplexy formation in PCa.<b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Topoisomerase II,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Minh-Tam N.

In pediatric leukemia, the most common rearrangement is the t(9; 11) (p22; q23) reciprocal translocation, which results in the expression of the <i>MLL-AF9<\/i> fusion gene. Since the <i>MLL-AF9<\/i> rearrangement does not lead to direct activation of an enzyme, small molecule drug discovery remains challenging and despite decades of research on <i>MLL<\/i>-rearranged leukemia, we have been limited by the inability of acutely assessing the consequences of direct MLL-AF9 inactivation in relevant model systems. By coupling rapid PROTAC-mediated degradation of the oncogenic MLL-AF9 fusion protein with genome-wide gene expression and chromatin analyses we have now been able to identify the immediate transcriptional and chromatin state consequences of MLL-AF9 degradation. Specifically, we have established a core set of MLL-AF9 target genes whose expression changes within minutes of MLL-AF9 degradation. These rapid expression changes are mediated by changes in productive RNA Polymerase II elongation and increased RNA Polymerase II pausing. At later timepoints, degradation of the fusion protein also induces loss of an active chromatin landscape at MLL-AF9 target genes, characterized by loss of MLL-AF9 associated proteins and activating histone modifications. These insights improve our mechanistic understanding of how MLL-AF9 mediates chromatin remodeling and leukemogenesis, while also helping us evaluate small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic mechanisms that target the MLL-AF9 protein complex. Specifically, we investigated how degradation of MLL-AF9 compares to enzymatic inhibition of DOT1L or inhibition of the MENIN-MLL interaction. Interestingly, both DOT1L and MENIN inhibitors fell short when comparing their effects to MLL-AF9 degradation and only combined DOT1L\/MENIN inhibition induced global MLL-AF9 destabilization on chromatin, thus disrupting the full MLL-AF9 directed epigenetic and transcriptional program. Ultimately, we were able to confirm these findings in a patient-derived xenograft model <i>in vivo<\/i>, where only the combination was able to significantly prolong leukemia free survival. In summary, our studies establish the cellular and molecular consequences of targeted degradation of the MLL-AF9 fusion oncoprotein and help improve our understanding of small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic mechanisms as cancer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Epigenetics,Small molecule drugs,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah Naomi Olsen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Godfrey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James P.
