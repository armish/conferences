[{"Abstract":"Atypical BRAF (non-V600) alterations comprise approximately half of all BRAF mutations in cancer and can be categorized according to characteristics of molecular signaling (either Class II or III). Atypical BRAF alterations are rare (approximately 3% across all human cancers) and there are currently no approved therapies for this indication. As next-generation sequencing becomes standard clinical practice, oncologists are frequently identifying atypical BRAF alterations in their patients&#8217; tumors. The efficacy of the first-in-class ERK1\/2 inhibitor, ulixertinib (BVD-523), was assessed across 10 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, which harbored class II or III BRAF alterations (5 models with type II alterations, 4 models with class III, and 1 model with both class II and III). Responses ranging from robust regression to moderate tumor growth delay were observed in 9\/10 models. RNA sequencing was performed on tumors from the vehicle-treated and ulixertinib-treated groups with three replicates per PDX model. The samples were collected 2 hours after the last dose of treatment. Expression of the mutant BRAF alleles was readily confirmed from RNA-seq data in all PDX models. In addition, gene expression analysis showed differential expression of MAPK pathway genes in responders compared to the non-responders.<br \/>In summary, ulixertinib has exhibited strong pre-clinical activity in a variety of patient-derived xenograft models with atypical BRAF alterations. Ulixertinib has FDA fast-track designation for patients with solid tumors, other than CRC, harboring specific BRAF mutations (G469A, L485W, or L597Q) and is currently under clinical evaluation in patients with tumors harboring any atypical BRAF alteration (NCT04488003).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/80faec1a-eda8-40bd-87cb-fdfcd50b2dca\/@x03B8ZFi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Pharmacogenetics and therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,BRAF,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13843"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Deborah Knoerzer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anupama Reddy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adnan Derti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline M.

KRAS is mutated in over 95% of PDAC tumors and is a key driver of PDAC tumorigenesis. Mutant KRAS is constitutively active and drives proliferation through the upregulation of numerous signaling and metabolic pathways to support tumor proliferation. Despite the promise of targeted inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK signaling pathway, arguably the most critical RAS-mediated proliferative signaling pathway, clinical trials targeting oncogenic MEK\/ERK signaling as a single-agent therapy have been unsuccessful. The PDAC tumor microenvironment has been shown to be depleted of glutamine and free amino acids, suggesting that PDAC relies heavily on nontraditional metabolic processes for proliferation such as macropinocytosis, the nonselective uptake of proteins and molecules from extracellular spaces, and autophagy, a mode of cellular recycling. Macropinocytosis has been shown to be elevated in PDAC cell lines and human tumors. Despite recent findings describing the limited nutrient availability in the tumor microenvironment, cell culture studies supporting the use of MEK\/ERK inhibitors are predominately performed in a high glutamine medium. By utilizing a minimal glutamine medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin, a large protein that is absorbed via macropinocytosis, we show that this growth medium drives resistance to MEK MAPK inhibition. To evaluate whether PDAC cells proliferating in a low glutamine medium can be sensitized to MEK inhibition, we have performed a CRISPR\/Cas9 loss-of-function screen targeting the druggable genome to determine effective therapeutic combinations under these conditions. To follow up on our in vitro screen, we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of our findings with 2D and 3D PDAC proliferation assays. These studies will describe novel treatment strategies for PDAC patients with elevated macropinocytosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-01 Cellular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,MEK inhibitor,Metabolism,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13845"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda Linke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Burge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Hobbs<\/i><\/presenter>.

Moreover, MAPK pathway alterations are also emerging as potential mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapy in AML including FLT3 inhibitors and venetoclax. In an ex vivo pharmacologic analysis of primary AML samples, sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (ARRY-142886) was enriched in patient samples resistant to venetoclax. Clinical activity of MAPK pathway inhibitors such as selumetinib has been explored in AML but monotherapy responses were modest. Another MEK inhibitor, cobimetinib, is currently being tested in combination with venetoclax in AML. We sought to understand whether combining selumetinib with BH3 mimetics such as venetoclax would improve efficacy in AML models. We evaluated combination activity of selumetinib plus venetoclax or the MCL1 inhibitor AZD5991 in a panel of AML cell lines. Cells were exposed to a 6x6 matrix of both agents for 72hrs and then viability assessed using CellTiter-Glo. Combination benefit was assessed using highest single agent (HSA) analysis. Selumetinib+AZD5991 demonstrated strong combination benefit (HSA score &#62;0.1, E<sub>max<\/sub> &#62;0.5) in 4\/19 AML cell lines. Selumetinib+venetoclax showed strong combination activity in 6\/19 lines. Three lines showed benefit with both combinations. Many of these cell lines harbor MAPK pathway mutations including OCI-AML5 (SOS1<sup>N233Y<\/sup>, NF1<sup>K1385R<\/sup>), ML-2 (KRAS<sup>A146T<\/sup>), HL-60 (NRAS<sup>Q61L<\/sup>), and Nomo-1 (KRAS<sup>G13D<\/sup>). Selumetinib treatment also led to robust BIM induction in vitro. Nomo-1 xenografts were evaluated for in vivo sensitivity to venetoclax (100 mg\/kg qd PO), 5-azacytidine (1mg\/kg BID q8h 3days on\/4days off IP), AZD5991 (30mpk bid q2h qw IV), selumetinib (10 mg\/kg bid q8h PO), as well as combinations of venetoclax+5-aza, AZD5991+selumetinib, and venetoclax+selumetinib. Venetoclax and venetoclax+5-aza treatment were ineffective. Selumetinib monotherapy led to 63% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) but tumors eventually grew out through treatment. The combination of selumetinib+venetoclax slightly improved efficacy (81% TGI) but markedly delayed tumor outgrowth (selumetinib monotherapy arm reached mean tumor volume &#62;1000 mm<sup>3<\/sup> on day 17, selumetinib+venetoclax reached average of ~966 mm<sup>3<\/sup> on day 28). Reducing venetoclax dose (30mg\/kg qd) or frequency (100mg\/kg 3days on\/4days off) maintained most of the combination efficacy. Selumetinb+AZD5991 also strongly improved efficacy compared to either monotherapy (88% TGI, mean tumor volume did not exceed ~400mm<sup>3<\/sup> by day 28). Together these data suggest potential for combining MEK inhibitors with BH3 mimetics in AML. Work is ongoing to further understand how scheduling impacts combination efficacy, evaluate the triple combination of selumetinib+BH3 mimetic+azacytidine, and assess efficacy in disseminated models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b1db488e-f506-498a-b05a-289a4918ae0a\/@x03B8ZFi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Acute myeloid leukemia,Apoptosis,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13841"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Courtney L.

Among these mutations, the glycine-to-cysteine mutation of amino acid 12 (KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>), found in ~13% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ~4% of colorectal cancer (CRC), can be specifically targeted and irreversibly locked in the inactive state by covalent modification of Cys<sup>12<\/sup>. We have previously reported the discovery and preclinical profile of JDQ443, a selective, oral, covalent inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> that binds under the Switch II loop. Here, we report its antiproliferative and antitumor activity against panels of cancer cell lines as well as cell- (CDX) and patient-derived (PDX) tumor xenografts.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> JDQ443 antiproliferative activity was assessed by a high-throughput cell viability assay in a large panel of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> (n=17) and non-G12C (n=233) cell lines. Single-agent antitumor activity was assessed against a panel of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> CDX models from NSCLC (LU99, H2122, H2030, and HCC44), pancreatic (Mia PaCa-2), and esophageal (KYSE410) cancer cell lines, plus one non-G12C lung line (H441; KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>). JDQ443 <i>in vivo<\/i> activity against a panel of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> NSCLC (n=10) and CRC (n=9) PDX models was assessed either as a single agent or in combination with TNO155 (SHP2 inhibitor [i]), trametinib (MEKi), or ribociclib (CDK4\/6i). <i>In vivo<\/i> combination studies with TNO155 were also performed in CDX models (LU99, H2030, HCC44, and KYSE410).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> <i>In vitro<\/i>, JDQ443 demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity selectively towards KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> cell lines.

Single-agent antitumor activity (best average response, duration of reduction in tumor doubling time) was observed across both PDX panels and was improved by all three combination treatments. The JDQ443\/TNO155 combination improved single-agent activity across CDX models, with comparable antitumor benefit maintained at QD or BID TNO155 schedules in two of three models (LU99 and KYSE410).

The Kras gene is frequently mutated in pancreatic cancer, but previous clinical trials using RAS inhibitors have proven ineffective. Additionally, many drug treatments targeting the MAPK pathway have shown little success due to the inherent drug resistance of pancreatic cancer cells and to acquired resistance through activation of alternative proliferative pathways such as JAK-STAT and PI3K-AKT. Our pathway analysis after MEK inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells displayed sustained and\/or upregulation of AKT activity in multiple cell lines. Therefore, we hypothesize that a combination treatment of Trametinib and Omipalisib would block two prominent mitogenic pathways (MEK and AKT, respectively) to suppress cancer cell proliferation and migration. Multiple analyses including Western blot, clonogenic, 5-Ethynyl-2&#8217;-Deoxyuridine (EDU), and scratch migration assays were employed to determine the augmentation of cellular function in murine and anthropic pancreatic cancer cell lines after single or combination treatment with Trametinib and\/or Omipalisib. Results demonstrated that application of Omipalisib alone was successful at blocking pAKT but failed to suppress pERK. Conversely, Trametinib alone selectively inhibited pERK but did not affect pAKT levels. The combination treatment successfully suppressed both pathways in relatively low quantities, indicating their efficacy as a dual therapeutic. Dual therapy was further effective at inhibiting cell growth as evidenced by clonogenic and EdU assays. Recovery and closure from an <i>in vitro<\/i> scratch wound was also significantly inhibited with combination of Omipalisib and Trametinib. In vivo studies demonstrated that both the pancreatic xenograft mean tumor growth and final tumor size were significantly reduced in response to the combination treatment compared to vehicle. In conclusion, dual therapy with Omipalisib and Trametinib showed a greater anti-tumor efficacy than treatment with either drug alone. Currently, we are determining the prolonged effectiveness of this combination treatment program in genetically-engineered mouse models. If successful, a pharmacological application of Omipalisib and Trametinib has the potential to provide a beneficial therapeutic option to pancreatic cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5872a34d-6d82-4d44-b78b-bacced75dcf0\/@x03B8ZFi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Therapeutics,Akt,ERK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15788"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jarrid Jack<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Pierce<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Bailey Bye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>McKinnon Walsh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prabhakar Chalise<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael N.

In AML with mutant (mt) NPM1 (NPM1c), MLL1 is the main driver of HOXA9, MEIS1 and FLT3, promoting self-renewal and growth of AML stem-progenitor cells (LSCs). Treatment with Menin inhibitor (MI), SNDX-50469 or SNDX-5613, disrupts binding of Menin to its binding pocket in MLL1\/2 and MLL1-FP, reducing expressions of their targets and inducing differentiation and apoptosis. In the phase I\/II AUGMENT-101 clinical trial, SNDX-5613 monotherapy was well tolerated and achieved objective remissions in patients with previously treated relapsed\/refractory AML harboring MLL1r or NPM1c. However, majority of patients either fail to respond or eventually relapse. A minority of MLL1r AML (~9%) also exhibit a co-mutation in TP53, which is known to confer therapy resistance and poor outcome in AML. This creates the need to develop MI-based synergistic combinations with superior efficacy against patient-derived (PD) AML cells harboring MLL-FP or NPM1c. Present studies found that, following MI treatment, CyTOF analysis of PD MLL1-r and NPM1c AML cells showed decline in protein levels of Menin, MEIS1, MEF2C, PBX3, FLT3, CDK6 and BCL2 in phenotypically characterized AML LSCs expressing CLEC12A, CD123, CD244 and CD99. Notably, <i>in vitro<\/i> co-treatment with SNDX-50469 in combination with venetoclax, OTX015 (pan-BET inhibitor) or abemaciclib (CDK6 inhibitor) induced synergistic (determined by SynergyFinder V2) loss of viability in AML cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM13 and OCI-AML3), as well as in MOLM13 cells with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-in of mutant or allelic loss of TP53 and in PD AML cells with MLL-r or NPM1c, but not in normal CD34+ progenitor cells or AML cells lacking MLL-FP or NPM1c. A CRISPR screen with a validated, domain-specific gRNA library against chromatin regulators revealed BRD4, p300, MOZ and KDM1A as druggable co-dependencies with treatment with MI. Consistent with this, co-treatment with SNDX-50469 and OTX015, or the p300\/CBP inhibitor GNE049 was synergistically lethal <i>in vitro<\/i> in AML cells with MLL1r or NPM1c, either sensitive to MI or tolerant-resistant (induced<i> in vitro<\/i>) to MI (MITR cells). Co-treatment with SNDX-5613 and venetoclax or OTX015 compared to each drug or vehicle control, administered orally for 3 to 4 weeks to NSG mice engrafted with either MOLM13-GFP\/Luciferase xenograft or with PD NPM1c and mtFLT3 AML xenograft, caused significantly greater reduction in AML burden and increased overall survival without weight loss or other toxicities (p &#60; 0.005).

The recent development and approval of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant-specific inhibitors could change the clinical practice of lung cancer patients harboring KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutations. However, early clinical data indicate the development of acquired resistance after initial responses. All of the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors being tested in clinical trials to date target GDP-bound KRAS (OFF state), which makes them vulnerable to upstream pathway reactivation, as this will increase KRAS in a GTP-bound (ON) state and therefore reduce drug efficacy. In this study we use a covalent tri-complex KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor which targets KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> in the active state. In vitro, the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor RM-029 exhibited higher efficacy than the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitor MRTX849 (adagrasib). However, treatment with RM-029 also showed adaptive RAS pathway reactivation after 24 hours of treatment, which can be blocked using the SHP2 inhibitor RMC-4550, suggesting that pathway reactivation is mediated by signaling from RTKs to RAS proteins. In vivo, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) treatment led to strong regression of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumors and addition of a SHP2 inhibitor significantly increased anti-tumor responses. Single treatments with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) or SHP2 inhibitors led to complete responses in some animals and immunological memory in an immune responsive KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> lung tumor model, with all tumors showing complete responses when the inhibitors were combined. Consistent with this finding, both KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) and SHP2 inhibition resulted in a profound remodeling of the lung tumor microenvironment (TME), with increased infiltration and activation of T cells accompanied by a reduction of tumor-promoting myeloid cells. Interestingly, similar changes were obtained in an immune evasive KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> lung cancer model. Besides acting upstream RAS, SHP2 has also specific roles in immune cells, including regulation of T cell function. As comparison, responses to SOS1 inhibition, which acts only upstream RAS, have also been analyzed. Overall, our preclinical results show that the anti-tumor activity of the combination of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) with SHP2 inhibition is the result of different mechanisms. First, a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor potently inhibits oncogenic RAS and addition of a SHP2 inhibitor blocks RAS pathway reactivation increasing tumor responses. Second, both inhibitors have beneficial effects in the TME which can be potentiated when combined. Finally, addition of a SHP2 inhibitor could potentially overcome intrinsic resistant populations by directly targeting cells resistant to G12C inhibition and\/or by increasing anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ac544c6-7525-4a8e-9817-c0eb8e64f732\/@y03B8ZFj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,NSCLC,Combination therapy,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14954"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Panayiotis Anastasiou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edurne Mugarza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Boumelha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sareena Rana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Moore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Miriam Molina-Arcas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julian Downward<\/i><\/presenter>.

In present studies, we determined that knock out (KO) of mutant (mt) NPM1 (NPM1c) in the AML OCI-AML3, utilizing targeted gRNA (compared to control) and CRISPR-Cas9, induced growth arrest, morphologic differentiation and loss of viability of the KO cells over 5 to 9 days. This was associated with depletion of protein levels of NPM1c, c-Myc, and MEIS1, but upregulation of PU.1, RUNX1, CD11b, p21 and NOXA levels. ChIP-Seq analysis with H3K27Ac antibody 5d after KO demonstrated reduced peak density at the super-enhancers of MYC, MEIS1, and HOXA9. RNA-Seq analysis showed negative enrichment of HALLMARK gene sets of mRNA expression of MEIS1\/HOXA9, MYC targets, ribosome\/translation and cell cycle. Compared to OCI-AML3 with NPM1c, OCI-AML3 with NPM1 KO exhibited abrogation of the Menin inhibitor SNDX-50469-induced differentiation and apoptosis. Additionally, NPM1 KO also significantly reduced sensitivity of OCI-AML3 cells to apoptosis induced by targeted agents previously shown to demonstrate efficacy against AML cells with NPM1c, including KPT-330 (XPO1 inhibitor), homoharringtonine (protein translation inhibitor), and anti-AML chemotherapeutic agents, including daunorubicin, cytarabine and etoposide. However, NPM1 KO sensitized OCI-AML3 cells to ATRA (all trans retinoic acid)-induced differentiation and loss of viability, which was associated with marked induction of p21 and CD11b. Utilizing RNA-Seq signature of NPM1c KO and interrogating the LINCS1000-CMap data set of gene expression signatures, we determined that among the top expression mimickers were several pan-HDAC inhibitors and a WEE1 kinase inhibitor. Treatment with adavosertib (WEE1 inhibitor, MK-1775) or romidepsin (HDAC inhibitor) dose-dependently induced apoptosis in OCI-AML3 cells, as well as in 5 samples of patient-derived (PD) AML cells with NPM1c. Moreover, co-treatment with adavosertib and romidepsin synergistically induced lethality in OCI-AML3 and PD AML cells with NPM1c. This was associated with marked reduction in protein expressions of c-Myc, c-Myb, MEIS1 and CDK4\/6, but upregulation of TP53 and p21 levels. These findings highlight that presence of NPM1c mechanistically regulates the sensitivity of AML cells to Menin inhibitor, ATRA and anti-AML chemotherapeutic agents. They also identify the novel non-chemotherapy combination of pan-HDAC inhibitor and WEE1 inhibitor for its potential synergistic activity against AML with NPM1c.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/777dea96-630c-4fa3-b6cc-ad36b5b2056e\/@y03B8ZFj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Targeted therapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13855"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher P.

Signaling by the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway is frequently deregulated in solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Inhibition of mTOR by small molecule inhibitors has therefore attracted great attention as an anti-cancer therapy. However, due to relatively modest clinical efficacy, no mTOR inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of lung cancer. The research of potentially predictive biomarkers is a key aspect of all anti-tumor treatment strategies to improve the proportion of patients benefiting from therapy. Multiple genetic alternations have been reported to be correlated with better anti-tumor efficacy of mTOR inhibition in animal models or patients, such as NFE2L2 mutation, STK11 mutation, or RICTOR amplification. Here, we report Muc5B mutation as a positive predictive biomarker for mTORC1\/2 inhibition by ATG-008 (Onatasertib), a dual mTORC1\/2 kinase inhibitor, in preclinical lung cancer models.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> 31 different lung cancer cell lines were treated with ATG-008 in vitro to determine the dose-response curves and the Area Under Curve (AUC) values. According to the AUC, the cell lines were classified as a sensitive group, medium group, and insensitive group. Unbiased genomic analysis of the tested cell lines was used to correlate the gene mutation, amplification, and expression with the sensitivity to ATG-008. The potential positive predictive biomarker, MUC5B mutation, was further validated in lung cancer CDX mouse models. Mouse bearing lung cancer cell lines with or without MUC5B mutation were orally treated with ATG-008 to determine the in vivo tumor growth inhibition.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>ATG-008 inhibits lung cancer cell growth in vitro, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 0.36&#181;M to &#62;10&#181;M. By genomic analysis, we identified 23 genes with a significant difference in AUC values between mutant and wild type cell lines, among which MUC5B mutation was found in 7\/10 sensitive cell lines and only 2\/10 in insensitive cell lines. Cell lines that carried MUC5B mutation had significantly lower AUC compared with MUC5B wild type cell lines (p=0.0084). Oral dosing of ATG-008, 10mg\/kg, QD, induced potent tumor growth inhibition(TGI) in MUC5B mutant CDX models, with 53.2% TGI in NCI-H82 model and 81.9% TGI in SK-MES-1 model. However, in MUC5B wild type models, the TGI is only 20.5% in NCI-H209 model and 36% in NCI-H526.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>These results suggest that the presence of MUC5B mutation correlates with more potent anti-tumor efficacy of ATG-008, potentially serving as a positive predictive biomarker for patient enrichment that warrants further investigation in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9158cc9c-f278-48be-b95a-078f5c8b3148\/@y03B8ZFj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Pharmacogenetics and therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,mTOR,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13857"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bing Hou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shengyue Piao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhi Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Shan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Mei<\/i><\/presenter>.

Many TPD drugs are discovered serendipitously, and we are only beginning to harness their potential. Understanding how TPD drugs co-opt the proteolysis pathway is important, as it could allow molecule re-engineering for TPD of new proteins (ie. neo-substrates). A rising example of TPD drugs are the selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) - small molecule antagonists of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) that target ER protein for degradation. SERDs are the next generation of therapy for metastatic ER+ breast cancer. Currently, fulvestrant is the only FDA approved SERD, but fulvestrant is limited by poor pharmacokinetics and resistance conferred by ER mutations (ie. ER-Y537S). An intense pharmaceutical effort has developed five novel SERDs in phase three clinical trials. These novel SERDs have diverse side chains for inducing ER degradation but share advantages including non-steroidal structure, oral bioavailability, and activity against ER-Y537. Based on the diverse molecular properties of SERDs, I hypothesized they utilize different ubiquitin-proteasome pathway genes (such as E3 ligases) for ER degradation. To identify the machinery for SERD-mediated ER degradation, I designed a functional CRISPR\/Cas9 screen, with highlights including a genome-wide gRNA library and measurement of endogenous ER protein in ER+ breast cancer cells. Initially focusing on genes required for fulvestrant-mediated ER degradation, we identified the proteolysis pathway as a top hit (q&#60;5x10-6) including central genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UBC, PSMA6, and NEDD8) and the ubiquitin-like SUMO pathway (UBC9 and RWDD3). Ubiquitin E3 ligases were also identified, including FBXO45 and VHL, which have been previously implicated as E3 ligases for ER. These hits were validated using inhibitors of ubiquitin- , NEDD8- , and SUMO-activating enzymes. These results demonstrate that multiple proteolysis mechanisms are sufficient for ER protein degradation. Currently, I am applying this screening approach to novel SERDs (such as elacestrant, amnecestrant, and giredestrant) to identify overlapping and unique mechanisms of degradation for wild-type ER and ER-Y537S. Importantly, understanding the mechanisms of these exciting new drugs will allow anticipation of resistance mechanisms in advanced ER+ breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f4a659a-03bd-41b2-bcaa-a06a8348d0cc\/@y03B8ZFj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor,Breast cancer,Proteasome-mediated degradation,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13849"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zachary Sandusky<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Despite the increase in therapeutic options for the treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC), cytotoxic chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan still constitutes the mainstay of the treatment. These genotoxic drugs function by inducing direct or indirect DNA damage, which leads to cell cycle block and cell death. We previously showed that the presence of transcriptional repression of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a gene involved in direct repair of methylated guanines, confers increased sensitivity to temozolomide treatment -a DNA alkylating agent- in mCRC patients. We conducted a screening for down-regulation of DNA repair genes in a large panel of 245 molecularly annotated human colorectal cancer cell lines with the aim to identify other pharmacological liabilities to alkylating agents. 5 cell lines (2%) were identified to be significantly downregulated for alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase alkB homolog 3 (ALKBH3). ALKBH3 encodes a DNA dioxygenase that counteracts toxic alkylation damage inflicted by SN2 agents such as methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), and is particularly active at repairing 3-methyl-Cytosine (3meC) residues on single stranded DNA (ssDNA). Previous reports have shown that epigenetic loss of ALKBH3 has prognostic implication in lung cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer. However, no predictive value is currently known for ALKBH3 downregulation with respect to alkylating agents treatment. In order to evaluate the pharmacogenomics of ALKBH3-deficient CRC we firstly validated the absence of ALKBH3 protein by WB analysis in our CRC cell panel, then we confirmed ALKBH3 CpG promoter methylation, as previously described in literature for breast cancer models. Subsequently, we evaluated the sensitivity to several alkylating agents, including temozolomide, cisplatin, MMS, dacarbazine, lomustine, and carmustine in our panel of ALKBH3-null cell lines in comparison with a panel of ALKBH3-proficient cell lines. One MGMT-methylated CRC cell line was used as positive control for high sensitivity to temozolomide. We performed both short term (96 hours) and long term (up to 14 days) cell viability assay, using as readout for cell viability CellTitre Glow (CTG) and crystal violet staining, respectively. No statistically significant differences in sensitivity to alkylating agents was found in ALKBH3-null cell lines compared to ALKBH3-proficient cell lines, irrespectively from other genetic biomarkers such as microsatellite status or RAS\/BRAF mutations. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ALKBH3 expression is not a candidate predictive biomarker for sensitivity to alkylating agents in CRC, most likely because of a high degree of redundancy of the systems involved in direct repair of alkylated DNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0c13923-7c3e-441f-b2d5-7e0b2e4ef753\/@y03B8ZFj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-01 Cellular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Alkylating agents,Pharmacogenetics,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13848"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pietro Paolo Vitiello<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Mariella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pietro Andrei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vito Amodio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Germano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annalisa Lorenzato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlotta Cancelliere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Bardelli<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here we sought to investigate the utility of synthetic lethality (SL) interactions discovered from large-scale CRISPR functional screens (i.e. the BROAD and Sanger Cancer Dependency Maps or \"DepMap\") as predictors of targets that validate in patients. Mutual exclusivity, the phenomenon where two genes are rarely mutated together in the same tumor, is a powerful clinical-stage readout that can be caused by synthetic lethality. We found that SL interactions discovered in DepMap are significantly more likely to be mutually exclusive in TCGA when they include a driver (tumor-suppressor\/oncogene). These SL interactions represent high-value targeting opportunities with the advantage of clear patient selection criteria based on their driver mutation status. In an effort to identify drugs that target these proteins as potential repurposing opportunities, we found that pharmacogenomic inhibition rarely invokes the same target dependencies as a genetic deletion of the drug target. Nonetheless, we identified several dozen \"clean\" drugs with potential for repositioning and validated the top candidates in PDx. Although tumours are more heterogenous than cancer cell lines, we show that cell line viability readouts linked to single-gene\/drug perturbations can yield accurate predictions of clinical efficacy when tied to tumor-driver biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cd4676bc-e80a-4f19-b4b8-f75ff4704058\/@y03B8ZFj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Pharmacogenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Therapeutic target,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13859"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tomas Babak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Vermeulen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Doris Coto Villa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Craig<\/i><\/presenter>.

High risk of immune-related adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is reported in patients due to on-target off-site effects of T cell engagers. Thus, reliable and translational mouse models are required to predict potential safety issues and investigate their rescue. Here we describe two preclinical models mimicking to some extent CRS induction upon activation with anti-CD3 antibodies.BRGSF (Balb\/C Rag2-\/-, IL2R&#947;-\/-, SIRP&#945;NOD and Flt3-\/-) is a highly immunodeficient mouse featuring reduced murine myeloid cells. Development of human lymphoid (B and T cells) and myeloid (NK, cDC, pDC and monocytes) compartments upon CD34+ HSC-engraftment are observed in blood, spleen and bone marrow and are stable for over a year, without side effects. Anti-hCD3 mAb, OKT3, administration in BRGSF-HIS mice induced a rapid release of human cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#947;, IL-2) in serum. Pretreatment with Flt3L, enhancing the human myeloid compartment, boosted the production of cytokines. CRS clinical signs such as hypothermia and weight lost were reproduced in OKT3-injected BRGSF-HIS mice. Pretreatment with Tocilizumab (an anti-IL-6R) reduced cytokine production, suggesting a strong role of myeloid cells in the induced-CRS pathogenesis. The main limitation of this model is the lack of a fully functional crosstalk between human immune cells and mouse stroma, which can undermine endothelial cells contribution in CRS. Alternatively, the CD3&#949; N-terminal epitope knock-in mice expressing the humanized epitope of anti-CD3 clone SP34 (hCD3&#949; mice) enables the investigation of endothelial versus immune cells dialogue in CRS pathogenesis. hCD3&#949; mice display a functional CD3-TCR complex and a functional T and B cooperation, as shown by T cell proliferation upon SP34 activation and antigen-specific antibodies production, respectively. Cytotoxic responses were induced by various bispecific antibodies, <i>ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Splenocytes from hCD3&#949; mice activated with BsAb1 bispecific antibody targeting CD3&#949; and a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) induced mouse cytokines production (IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-1&#946;, IL-10) in a concentration-dependent manner. A 2nd BSAb targeting CD3&#949; and an irrelevant TAA didn&#8217;t induce any cytokine release, confirming the specificity of the previous cytokine induction.These data suggest that both BRGSF-HIS and hCD3&#949; models could be used to assess T cell engager-induced CRS in a complementary setting: while BRGSF-HIS mice enable monitoring of any anti-hCD3 agent, the model might undermine the contribution of mouse endothelial cells due to specie specificity barrier of human cytokines and mouse cells. In contrast, hCD3&#949; mice enable monitoring of cytokine induction upon activation with SP34-derived anti-hCD3 taking into consideration a full crosstalk between immune and endothelial cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d5795b5-27eb-4b1e-a457-d456cb98e2ec\/@z03B8ZFk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-06 Preclinical toxicology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Cytokine release syndrome,Safety,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13853"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"27977fab-b8f5-4ac6-b2f1-94376776f146","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/27977fab-b8f5-4ac6-b2f1-94376776f146\/@z03B8ZFk\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Perrine Martin-Jeantet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florence Renart-Depontieu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludovic Bourre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaëlle Martin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Pappalardo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dean O.

To develop novel hypotheses on how NAT1 contributes to breast cancer development and progression, NAT1 knockout (KO) cell lines (KO2 and KO5) were created from MDA-MB-231 using CRISPR\/Cas9 technology. According to our proteomics and RNA sequencing analyses, <b>NAT1 KO cells have increased cytidine deaminase (CDA)<\/b>, a player in the pyrimidine salvage pathway.<b> <\/b>Metabolomics data showed NAT1 KO cells had <b>defects in the <i>de novo<\/i> pyrimidine pathway<\/b>, which can explain the upregulation of the salvage pathway. Pyrimidine <i>de novo<\/i> synthesis and salvage pathways are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis and cell growth.We hypothesize that NAT1 plays a key role in maintaining pyrimidine biosynthesis in breast cancer cells, and hence, exhibit increased sensitivity to some of chemotherapeutic drugs that depends on pyrimidine metabolic pathways for their cytotoxicity.<br \/>Parental, KO2, and KO5 MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were treated with several different classes of drugs: CDA inhibitors: Tetrahydrouridine and zebularine; pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors teriflunomide and leflunomide; DNA damaging agent doxorubicin; and cytidine analogues 5-hydroxymethyl-2&#8217;-deoxycytidine, 5&#8217;-formyl-2&#8217;-deoxycytidine, and 5&#8217;-deoxy-5-fluoropyridine at varying concentrations for 4 days. Cell viability was assessed by Alamarblue assay. Differences between cell lines were assessed for statistical significance by two-way ANOVA.<br \/>The results were as follows Tetrahydrouridine: No statistically significant difference in cell viability between parental and NAT1 KOs except at 200 &#181;M p= 0.0002Zebularine: Statistically significant difference between parental and NAT1 KOs at concentrations above 60 &#181;M at p &#60; 0.0001Teriflunomide: Statistically significant difference between parental and NAT1 KOs between 20 and 60 &#181;M at p &#60; 0.0001Leflunomide: No statistically significant difference between parental and NAT1 KOs except at 200 &#181;M at p = 0.00065&#8217;- Formyl- 2'- Deoxycytidine: Statistically significant difference between parental and NAT1 KOs above 12 &#181;M at p = 0.0042Doxorubicin: No statistically significant difference between parental and NAT1 KOs 5-Hydroxymethyl-2&#8217;-deoxycytidine: No statistically significant difference between parental and NAT15&#8217;-Deoxy-5-fluorocytidine: No statistically significant difference between parental and NAT1 KOs<br \/>Whereas the results with many of the drugs were inconsistent with our initial hypothesis, it is possible that the NAT1 KO cells are more resistant to CDA or pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors because of the upregulation of CDA. Understanding the pharmacogenomic similarities in Tetrahydrouridine, zebularine and teriflunomide&#8217;s may help develop a new hypothesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a9d835e9-6618-491c-b95b-96ec23bc5af3\/@z03B8ZFk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Pharmacogenetics and therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Pharmacogenomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13829"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Afi Henriette H.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological lung cancer subtype in all population groups including blacks. There are no <i>in vitro<\/i> model systems to study lung cancer in black subjects, and there is only one lung adenocarcinoma cell line from a black patient (NCI-H23). Here we aim to address the lack of <i>in vitro<\/i> models to study black LUAD. Using three-dimensional (3D) biofabrication technologies, we&#8217;ve developed a thick vascularized tissue model to recapitulate physiologically relevant heterogeneous human alveoli. Specifically, the blood-air barrier of the alveolar model is simulated with two perfusable channels embedded in a thick vascularized tissue construct: a helical blood channel and a straight air channel. Spatially, the air channel is in the center and is surrounded by the blood channel. Human endothelial cells are seeded onto the inner surface of the blood channel and NCI-H23 cells (which carry a <i>KRAS <\/i>mutation) or untransformed alveolar epithelial cells derived from black subjects, are seeded on the inner surface of the air channel. The blood and air channels are perfused using cell medium and oxygenated air, respectively. The model is used for the study of potential LUAD therapeutic agents such as polyisoprenylated cysteinyl amide inhibitors (PCAIs), which target and disrupt the <i>RAS<\/i>-mediated signaling pathway. <i>KRAS<\/i> is the most commonly mutated oncogene in LUAD in blacks, and our experiments are aimed at ensuring that PCAIs are effective in black LUAD and may offer better treatment outcomes for ethnically\/racially diverse patients in whom the <i>RAS<\/i> signaling pathway is frequently altered and for whom pharmaceutical therapy is necessitated by the late diagnoses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e318d2de-fe89-474e-9496-0d1edffdd4af\/@z03B8ZFk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,K-ras,Lung adenocarcinoma,African American,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13844"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nadine Belony<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bing Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phuc Pham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Gregory<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pablo E.

In the current study, we investigated the effect of a physiologically relevant, low concentration of Cd on the regulation of liver cancer cell proliferation, steatosis, and fibrogenic\/oncogenic signaling. Exposure of Cd (1 to 10 nM) increased endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhanced cell proliferation in non-tumor derived HepaRG liver cells and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Exposure of Cd increased Jagged1 expression and activated Notch signaling in HepaRG and HCC cell lines. Cd activated AKT\/mTOR signaling by increasing phosphorylation of AKT-S473 and mTOR-S-4448 residues. Moreover, a low concentration of Cd also promoted cell steatosis and induced fibrogenic signaling in HCC cells. Similarly chronic exposure of HCC cells to a low concentration of Cd activated Notch and AKT\/mTOR signaling. Further RNA seq data revealed that chronic Cd exposure modulate cell steatosis\/fibrogenic gene expression that involved in fatty liver disease development. Cd induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#945; and its downstream oncogenic protein Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;)-Induced Protein 8 (TNFAIP8). Collectively our data suggest that a low concentration of Cd modulates cell steatosis and fibrogenic\/oncogenic signaling in HCC by activation of Notch\/AKT\/mTOR pathways.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b710290d-a652-4bb1-92c2-d00218d51ece\/@z03B8ZFk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-06 Preclinical toxicology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Autophagy,Notch,Toxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13846"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Suryakant Niture<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sashi Gadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minghui Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Qi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John T.

There is increased interest in using these PD assessments on cells from the periphery to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of investigational therapies. In this area of therapeutic development, much focus has been placed on checkpoint inhibitors proteins\/receptors such as PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3, CTLA-4, TIGIT, and multiple others. These immune checkpoint inhibitors are suitable targets since they can be upregulated and\/or modulated on exhausted T cells in cancer patients. Assessing the expression of these markers in the tumor itself would be an invasive process and provide little information to correlate with pharmacokinetic results throughout the course of a clinical trial to determine optimal dose selection. However, assessment of the receptor expression and occupancy in combination with pharmacokinetics can lead to a better understanding of drug levels required to achieve optimal therapeutic performance. Monitoring the expression and binding of these molecules by drug can determine specific treatment based on the ability of the patient&#8217;s own immune system to act, while providing information to identify therapeutic responses against cancer.

We have developed a novel methodology to culture organoids from both human healthy pancreatic ductal epithelial tissues and PDAC. A collection of patient-derived organoids (PDO), grown using this protocol, numbers over 100 models to date. The 100% neoplastic purity of the organoid cultures facilitates molecular characterization that has been traditionally challenging in the pauci-cellular state of primary pancreatic tumors. These PDO open new opportunities for deep genomic and transcriptomic studies of the disease, and for individualized drug screens. Here we demonstrate that accurate predictive models of response to pharmacological treatments of PDAC can be developed using data from such screens alongside molecular profiles of the PDO.<br \/>Methods: Molecular analysis of the PDO library yielded genomic and transcriptional profiles of the cultures, including those of copy number variation (CNV), mutations in the exome and mRNA expression. From these, we drew features for prediction of drug responses. Using molecular features drawn from these profiles, we developed a panel of predictive models for response to standard-of-care cytotoxic agents and a number of targeted treatments. We employed Random Forest (RF) regression as a machine-learning tool for this purpose.<br \/>Results: PDO are faithful models of PDAC, whose molecular features closely resemble those of PDAC tumor specimens. Using a subset of these features, we were able to accurately learn PDO responses to cytotoxic agents: for each of the five agents considered, the predicted drug response correlated strongly (p &#60; 10<sup>-7<\/sup>) with the observed value. A similar accuracy of prediction was achieved for a number of targeted agents.<br \/>Conclusion: PDOs are a valuable resource for molecular and pharmacological characterization of PDAC, with a potential to guide clinical decisions with regard to treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b748de00-a768-440f-9613-460eb218b0f1\/@z03B8ZFk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Pharmacogenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug sensitivity,Pancreatic cancer,Pharmacogenomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13851"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Astrid Deschênes<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pascal Belleau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis Plenker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amber Habowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hardik Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngkyu Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hervé Tiriac<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsey A.

Fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), is the primary drug of choice for treating advanced metastatic ER<sup>+<\/sup>, BC. Currently, Faslodex<sup>&#174;<\/sup> (500 mg) is given as an intramuscular (IM) depot that achieves the steady-state plasma concentration of 24-28 ng\/mL of fulvestrant from day 28 onwards. Additionally, clinical studies suggest that current Faslodex<sup>&#174;<\/sup> (500 mg) achieves insufficient blockade of ER&#945; receptor plausibly due to suboptimal physicochemical and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. Hence, achieving higher fulvestrant plasma concentrations is a significant unmet need to improve efficacy and inhibit the development of drug resistance. To overcome these issues, we modified the physicochemical properties of the fulvestrant to enhance its solubility by developing a prodrug, KSHN001034, with the potential to deliver higher fulvestrant plasma exposures.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> KSHN001034 was evaluated for its physicochemical and ADME properties. Thermodynamic solubility and liver microsomal stability were performed. KSHN001034 was formulated as 100 mg\/mL compared with Faslodex (50 mg\/mL). Single-dose PK studies were performed using KSHN001034 in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and Beagle Dogs post-IM administration for 7 and 14 days, respectively. The uterotrophic activity was investigated by determining changes in uterine weight in juvenile female SD rats for KSHN001034 (10 mg\/kg, IP) and fulvestrant (25 mg\/kg, SC). The ER&#945; expression was also evaluated in rat uterus tissue via a simple western assay.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A remarkable improvement (~1100 fold) was achieved for KSHN001034 in aqueous solubility (1.112 mg\/mL) vs. fulvestrant (&#60;1 &#181;g\/mL). Significant improvement was observed in metabolic stability vs. fulvestrant. KSHN001034 showed significant improvement in PK exposure of fulvestrant upon IM administration in rats and dogs with higher AUC and C<sub>max<\/sub> compared to that of Faslodex. Relative bioavailability of fulvestrant post-KSHN001034 treatment was found to be &#62;6-fold in rats and ~2.5 fold in dogs compared to Faslodex. Treatment of KSHN001034 antagonized estradiol (E2)-mediated uterine stimulation, exhibiting significant inhibition (85%) of uterotrophic activity vs. fulvestrant (73%). KSHN001034 reduced E2-induced uterus weight, supporting efficacy due to released fulvestrant as it is a true SERD. Additionally, KSHN001034 significantly inhibited the E2-induced ER&#945; expression in rat uterus.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Overall, KSHN001034 indicates the potential to deliver higher fulvestrant concentrations that would effectively block the ER&#945; receptor resulting in improved efficacy and minimal emergence of resistance. Further, enhanced solubility and reduced injection volume would result in better patient compliance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a2db4692-da64-4416-9abe-6601fa31b1c9\/@z03B8ZFk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Pro-drug,SERD,Fulvestrant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13856"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Heta Pandya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ganesh Sangle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vishal Unadkat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vishal Goswami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Parva Purohit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chirag Mehta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonam Sinha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ketan Variya<\/i><\/presenter>.

One of the best known cardiotoxic agents is doxorubicin, a very powerful chemotherapeutic molecules for breast cancer. Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) is rich in cancer preventive polyphenols endowed with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant activities which could exert protective effects on heart cells. A very interesting derivative of EVOO preparation is represented by purified extracts from olive mill waste waters (OMWW) rich in polyphenols. Here, we have investigated the anti-cancer activity of a OMWW preparation, named A009, on breast cancer cells when combined with chemotherapeutics, as well as its potential cardioprotective activities. We had previously reported additive effects with cisplatin in prostate cancer cells. In previous studies we have shown that the combination of A009 with cisplatin or 5-FU was effective in decreasing prostate and colon cancer cell growth, while it did not further reduce growth of rat cardiomyocytes also treated with cisplatin or 5-FU. Here we used 5-fluorouracil as comparison.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Combination of A009 and chemotherapy was investigated in vitro on human breast cancer cell lines BT459, MDA-MB-234. The cardioprotective effects of the A009 extract were tested on H9C2 (cardiomyocytes) cells co-exposed to doxorubicin or 5-fluorouracil and in zebrafish embryos.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Adding A009 to doxorubicin or 5-FU was effective in decreasing breast cancer cell growth in monolayer. Breast tumor spheroids morphologically appeared less stable and with reduced diameter when treated with A009 extracts and with the chemotherapeutic agents 5-FU or Doxo, additive effects were observed. A009 mitigated toxicity of doxorubicin or 5-FU on rat cardiomyocytes cells H9C2. Cardioprotective effects were observed by the combination of OMWW extracts with Doxorubicin in Zebrafish embryos. In human cardiomyocytes, we observed 5-FU induced upregulation of the proinflammatory IL6 mRNA, which was reduced by OMWW treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our study demonstrates that the polyphenol rich purified A009 extracts enhance the effect of chemotherapy of doxorubicin and 5-FU on breast cancer cells but mitigates chemotherapy adverse effects on heart in vivo and on cardiomyocytes, appearing as a potential cardio-oncological prevenzion agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e7d11e13-def5-4efb-9a42-cd448cc1f345\/@z03B8ZFk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-06 Preclinical toxicology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polyphenols,Cardiotoxicity,Antioxidant,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13858"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adriana Albini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco M.
