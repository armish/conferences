[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Medical financial hardship, encompassing material, behavioral, and psychologic domains, is becoming an increasingly common consequence of illness in cancer patients. Identifying at-risk patients is the first step to develop proactive approaches to mitigate this problem. To try and address this need, Mayo Clinic Breast Disease Registry (MCBDR) is prospectively collecting data about financial concerns in addition to the usual sociodemographic and clinical information.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used data from Mayo Clinic Breast Disease Registry, a prospective cohort of consenting patients seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester within one year of initial breast cancer diagnosis. Participants completed baseline and annual follow-up surveys rating their financial concerns on a linear analogue scale from 0 (&#8220;none&#8221;) to 10 (&#8220;constant concerns&#8221;). We compared patient-reported financial concern at baseline to that on each patient&#8217;s most recent survey, with worsening concerns defined as a 1+-point increase. Logistic regression evaluated for predictors of worsening financial concerns.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 1,957 participants responded to financial concern questions on a baseline and at least one follow-up survey between 2015 and 2020. Mean age was 58.5 years (SD 12.5), and mean time between diagnosis and the most recent follow-up was 25.6 months (SD 16.2). 357 (18.2%) reported worsening financial concerns. Only lower baseline financial status was associated with a greater likelihood of worsening financial concerns (see Table). <b>Conclusions: <\/b>More than one in seven breast cancer survivors develop worsening financial concerns within 5-years of diagnosis, and those with less financial security at baseline appear to be most vulnerable.<br \/><b>Funding:<\/b> Breast Cancer Research Foundation (CLL) and NR015259 (KJR).<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{45F9CA34-C3A5-4B09-A69D-AECF22373A80}\"><caption>Patient and tumor characteristics, compared by

Despite this value, many researchers do not work with patient advocates. To understand why and build a roadmap for more engagement in the future, we hosted a workshop with patient advocates and research scientists then presented findings and discussed further at an international conference. We acknowledged four main barriers: 1) It is not clear to everyone why patient advocates should be included in research, 2) Researchers are worried about saying the wrong thing, 3) Researchers do not know where to meet patient advocates, and 4) Researchers do not know how to include patient advocates in research. We identified best practices from various organizations and opportunities to overcome these barriers in the short- and long-term. This is the first time a multi-stakeholder group has come together to provide ways to support research scientists with overcoming barriers to regularly working with patient advocates. Ultimately, these relationships will improve cancer research and more quickly accomplish our collective goal of improving lives of those who have been diagnosed with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/29198e31-989a-4494-85d2-cf701e4e8cf2\/@H03B8ZKP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-05 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Metastasis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11737"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hillary Stires<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Bado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thelma Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martha Carlson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isaac S.

Tumors demonstrating microsatellite instability (MSI) are known to be infiltrated by higher numbers of lymphocytes and to be characterized by a more favorable prognosis as compared with tumors with intact repair systems, and MSI is the only potential biomarker to predict the outcome of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the relationship between MSI and response to neoadjuvant CRT and changes in MSI status after CRT in rectal cancer are not well understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the MSI status before and after CRT and its association with CRT response in rectal cancer.<br \/><b>Materials and methods:<\/b> Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from pre-operative biopsy via sigmoidoscopy and surgical resection of the primary tumor were obtained from 84 rectal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent neoadjuvant CRT between March 2010 and May 2018. MSI assays were performed on DNA extracted from FFPE and matched normal tissues the extracted DNA was amplified by PCR with fluorescent dye-labeled primers targeting five microsatellite loci: BAT25, BAT26, D5S346, D2S123 and D17S250. Three immune biomarker scores were calculated from the 19 patients who were able to perform RNA sequencing analysis to compare the immune activities of the specimens between responder (n = 8) and non-responder (n = 11). The gene lists included in each score calculation were as follows: CXCL9, CXCL10, IDO1, IFNG, HLA-DRA, and STAT1; GZMA and PRF1; and CD247, CD2, CD3E, GZMH, NKG7, PRF1 and GZMK for the interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;) signature,<sup>1<\/sup> the cytolytic activity<sup>2 <\/sup>and the immune signature,<sup>3<\/sup> respectively.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Patients were classified, according to Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG), as responders (grade 1 or 2; 25 patients, 29.8%) and non-responders (grade 3, 4 or 5; 59 patients, 70.2%). The TRG of 84 patients was significantly different according to the pre-CRT MSI status (P = 0.024), but was not different according to the post-CRT MSI status among 60 patients who were eligible for the paired MSI test (P = 0.788). Changes in MSI status were observed in 11 of the 60 patients; MSS to MSI-low in 9 patients, MSS to MSI-high in 1 patient, and MSI-low to MSS in 1 patient. All three immune biomarker scores (the IFN-&#947; signature, the cytolytic activity and the immune signature) were higher in the responder group without significant difference (p = 0.536, p = 0.152, and p = 0.272, respectively).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our findings demonstrated that neoadjuvant CRT modulated the MSI status of rectal cancer and pre-CRT MSI status was significantly associated with response of CRT.

The 5-year overall survival (OS) for lung cancer patients is below 20%, lower than most other common cancers. In general, timely care can positively affect the survival of patients. However, previous studies of lung cancer and the effect of time-to-treatment on patient outcomes have been inconclusive. Some studies report adverse effects, while others report the association referred to as the &#8216;waiting time paradox&#8217;, where patients with severe diagnosis receive quicker care, but have poorer outcomes due to advanced disease. These studies investigate time-to-treatment of any type, but association between time-to-treatment for secondary treatments and outcomes for lung cancer has not been conclusively defined.<br \/>Methods: Treatment data from 714 patients with lung cancer diagnosis at Vanderbilt University Medical Center between 2001 and 2021 was used for this analysis. Secondary treatment data included data in three categories: chemotherapy (N=577), radiation therapy (N=126), and target therapies(N=11). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meir curves were used to model the effect of time-to-treatment on overall survival, adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, including if surgical resection was performed before secondary treatment start date. Time-to-treatment was defined as the interval of days between diagnosis or initial surgical procedure and treatment start date in four categories: 0-10 days (1), 11-20 days (2), 21-30 days (3), 31-45 days (4).<br \/>Results: Cox proportion regression analysis of patients treated within 30 days, including stage and time-to-treatment, had a significant difference in overall survival when stratified by cox linear predictor median (value = 0.0912). Patients with linear predictors values above the median (high) in the cox proportion model had a lower 3-year survival than patients with linear predictor values lower than the median (low) (p=0.0021). This contrast is seen clearly in early-stage lung cancer patients, who received chemotherapy as secondary treatment, where patients with longer time-to-treatment start (15-30 days) had a lower 3-year survival than patients with shorter time-to-treatment (0-15 days) (p=0.047).<br \/>Conclusions: The effect of changes in time-to-treatment initiation in lung cancer patients receiving secondary treatment appears to be sensitive to initiation within a 30-day period. Although past studies have focused on treatment start time initiation categories within weeks or months, our study is the first to elucidate a possible sensitivity to secondary initiation within just a few days period. Further examination aims to further detail treatment types, by investigating changes in dosage, treatment combinations, or institutions differences to better understand time-to-treatment effects on the survival rates of lung cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-02 Cancer survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Chemotherapy,Overall survival,Radiotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11742"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dianna J.

Breast cancer is among the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality globally, and there is a wide range of racial and ethnic disparities across the cancer continuum. Black women continue to have disproportionately high mortality rates compared to Whites, and are more impacted by triple-negative breast cancer and inflammatory breast cancer earlier in their lives and at more advanced stages. Patient navigation, particularly when culturally tailored to the intended population, is highly effective in reducing the complexity of access to care for cancer prevention and treatment. The growing momentum and usage of telehealth and virtual care has significant potential to reach Black women, to promote higher mammography screening and early detection of breast cancer. Virtual patient navigation can provide a safe, engaging, and accessible space to accelerate the application of practical approaches to address health disparities and increase preventive behaviors in underrepresented community. However, limited information exists on specific factors which impact the design, implementation, and receptivity of virtual navigation in Black communities. This study aims to: 2) Develop and test a culturally-adapted prototype of a virtual patient navigation intervention tool for increasing access to breast cancer screening education and promotion for Black women. 1) Use qualitative focus group methodology to explore the beliefs, attitudes, perceptions, and receptivity of community members of program usability and breast cancer awareness, prevention and screening behaviors among Black women. The study will examine social determinants of health that impact potential challenges to access utilization of mammography screening services. Qualitative focus group discussions will be conducted to guide the details of the virtual patient navigation, such as communication channels, specific messaging approaches, and sociocultural factors to integrate, as well as addressing current challenges and needs faced by the community. The results of this study can provide valuable insight to specific needs regarding outreach and access to screening mammography services to underrepresented communities of color to ultimately reduce breast cancer rates.

Incidence and mortality rates for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers all exceed national rates in Georgia and are higher among African Americans (AAs). Ensuring culturally competent and equitable health care delivery relies on creating an educated and engaged health care team. Patient stories are powerful examples of community-learned experiences and can be used to educate better providers and health care students who serve diverse populations, particularly when communicating risk and prevention of cancer. The goal of the CHANGE project is to provide a sustainable model of evidence-based cancer awareness through education - with an emphasis on prevention and early detection behaviors. We will develop a health disparities and culturally competent cancer care e-Learning curriculum for health care professionals, hematology-oncology fellows, residents, and medical students at the Medical College of Georgia.<br \/>METHODS. Thirty community members and stakeholders (93% AA, 76% female, all adults) were recruited through public housing, healthcare clinics and providers, and community organizations. Vignettes describing patient access and care interactions were used in semi-structured interviews to guide conversations about experiences accessing care, attitudes towards cancer prevention, and community cancer beliefs. Interviews were recorded, professionally transcribed, and content analyzed using NVivo 12.0 by two independent raters.<br \/>RESULTS. Three common themes emerged: accessibility of healthcare (transportation, finances, and difficulties in scheduling were primary barriers); cancer myths and cultural norms (no interpersonal discussion of cancer, seen as &#8220;taboo,&#8221; cancer will spread if cut into and cancer is contagious); and experience of racial bias in health care (historical racial bias and systemic racism; receipt of treatment and care perceived to be different due to race; lack of AA providers).<br \/>CONCLUSION. This sample adequately represented those most at risk for cancer in Augusta, GA area. Their shared experiences will be used to design and inform an e-learning curriculum, in conjunction with education on health disparities across the state and specific to the local community. This will provide a comprehensive approach to provider education that will begin to improve patient care satisfaction and health outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-05 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Community Based Participatory Research,Social Determinants of Health,Health Disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11744"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marlo M.

In the US, excellent outcomes depend on treatments tailored to risk groups or specific characteristics of each child's cancer. Unfortunately, most pediatric cancer patients live in LMICs, where physicians often diagnose cancer based on clinical findings due to limited access to pathology and molecular genomic services. The goal of the Texas Children&#8217;s Hospital (TCH) Global HOPE program is to improve outcomes for pediatric cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and improved diagnostics is a key component. The aim of this study was to design and validate a cost-effective assay to improve pediatric cancer diagnoses in low resourced settings. The NanoString nCounter platform was chosen due to minimal technical expertise required, ability to test sub-optimal RNA, and rapid turn-around-time (2-3 days). Custom panels were designed to detect 439 specific breakpoints of gene fusions associated with pediatric hematologic malignancies and 436 with pediatric solid tumors. Validation was performed using &#62;140 samples with known fusion status. The NanoString results were consistent with a 99% accuracy after follow-up sequncing of any potential false negative\/positive results (see table). Implementing this platform will greatly impact the ability to treat pediatric cancer in SSA by providing a more precise diagnosis. Testing will allow children to be treated according to the specific molecular characteristics of their cancers to maximize their chances of a cure, the same approach now considered standard-of-care in the United States. This work will also form the basis for establishing training in molecular and pediatric pathology in these LMICs, a critical need for long-term sustainability and reducing inequities of pediatric cancer care.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{88ABFF26-998F-430B-8BC4-9DDE4B0CB814}\"><caption>Custom Pediatric Cancer Fusion Panel Validation<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Custom Panel<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unique Evaluable Samples<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Initial False Negatives<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Initial False Positives<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">True False Negatives<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">True False Positives<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Accuracy by NanoString Panles<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Heme 1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">48<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">48 (100%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Heme 2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">34<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23 (100%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Heme 3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">32 (97%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Heme 4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">28<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">27 (96%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">143<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">141 (99%)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10852de9-8c13-4459-9e31-9389dc9a2bd7\/@H03B8ZKP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-01 Cancer health disparities,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular diagnosis,Pediatric cancers,LMICs,Global,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11746"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julie M.

While most of the ongoing research focuses on finding new treatments, accessibility to oncology care receives less attention. However, access to health services plays a key role in cancer survival. Spatial accessibility methods have been successfully applied to measure accessibility to primary care. Yet, little research to date focused on oncology care specifically.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We focused on all care centers with medicine, surgery, or obstetric activity in metropolitan France. We propose a clustering algorithm to automatically label the hospitals in terms of oncology specialization. Then, we computed an accessibility score to these hospitals for every municipality in metropolitan France. Finally, we proposed an optimization algorithm to increase the oncology accessibility by identifying centers which should increase their capacity.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We labelled 1,662 care centers into 8 clusters. Half of them were eligible for oncology care and 118 centers were identified as experts. We computed the oncology accessibility score for 34,877 municipalities in metropolitan France. Half of the population lived in the top 20% accessibility areas, and 6.3% in the bottom 20% zones. Accessibility was higher near dense cities, where the experts care centers were located. By combining the care centers clusters and the accessibility distributions, our optimization algorithm could identify hospitals to grow, to reduce accessibility disparities.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our method made it possible to quantify oncology care accessibility across all metropolitan France, as well as to make suggestions on where to increase hospital capacity to improve accessibility, especially in more populated suburban areas. Our approach was deliberately non-specific to cancer type nor to the kind of stays, but it could be adapted to more specific scenarios. We packaged our method into a web application allowing the users to run the algorithms with various parameters and visualize the results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fea9c8f5-5c02-4479-891e-e57271833647\/@z03B8ZKQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-01 Cancer health disparities,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Pathway,Machine learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11748"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eric Daoud<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Sophie Hamy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elise Dumas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lidia Delrieu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Grandal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Le Bihan-Benjamin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Houzard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe-Jean Bousquet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judicael Hotton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aude-Marie Savoye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christelle Jouannaud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>ChloÃ©-Agathe Azencott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Lelarge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reyal Fabien<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, these advancements have not easily translated to new treatment options and approvals for pediatric cancer patients. The Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) Act was signed into law in 2017 to accelerate the availability of drugs for pediatric cancer patients by requiring all new adult oncology therapeutics also conduct pediatric studies if the molecular target is relevant to pediatric cancer, including therapeutics with an orphan drug designation. RACE requirements were implemented on August 18th, 2020, and we evaluated the impact of the RACE Act since implementation. We evaluated all new drug applications or biologics license applications submitted and approved by the FDA from August 18, 2019-August 18, 2021. Qualifying drugs were stratified by applications approved one year before RACE implementation and applications submitted and approved one year post-RACE implementation. FDA approval letters and review documents were used to obtain information regarding pediatric study requirements and orphan drug designation. Nineteen therapeutics were identified within the study period (63.2% approved pre-RACE implementation and 36.8% approved post-RACE implementation. Only 11.8% of agents approved were indicated for pediatric use at the time of initial application, and the majority (78.9%) of approved applications received an orphan drug designation. Prior to the RACE Act, pediatric studies were waived for orphan drugs, regardless of possible applicability of the agent to pediatric cancers. However, 91.7% of the therapies approved pre-RACE implementation had a relevant mechanism of action (MoA) that may have required pediatric study if the application was submitted after RACE implementation. After RACE implementation, 71.4% of the therapies received an orphan drug designation, with 60% requiring pediatric studies due to the relevancy of the MoA. Pediatric studies were waived or exempt for all therapies during the study period prior to RACE implementation. However, following implementation of RACE, 42.9% of approved drugs require pediatric studies. The remaining therapeutics approved post-implementation had waived pediatric study requirements due to studies being impossible or highly impracticable given the pediatric prevalence in the indication. The one-year anniversary of RACE implementation provides the opportunity to begin to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach and recognize opportunities to expand its reach in the future. We found an increase in required pediatric studies after implementation, with the largest effect seen in orphan-designated therapeutics that are no longer automatically exempt. However, many pediatric study requirements are still waived for therapeutics with relevant MoA, highlighting the opportunity for future policy modifications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/73d352bc-ba7b-4b76-bc7c-01be3057d490\/@z03B8ZKQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-02 Clinical trial design and accrual,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Regulation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14966"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brittany A.

The safety and effectiveness profile of a drug can be improved by using it in patients where that drug is most likely to be effective. While PARP inhibitors are indicated for use in some patients with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, patients with other cancers that are deficient in homologous recombination repair (HRR) might also benefit from their use. However, determining whether a cancer is HRD-positive is neither trivial nor precise. While clinical trials have shown that patients with deleterious mutations in BRCA2 and BRCA1 are most likely to benefit from PARP inhibitors, determining that a given BRCA mutation (or set of such mutations) is in fact deleterious is frequently not straightforward. Therefore, assays are now looking for signs of HRD, such as genomic instability consistent with non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) being used for the repair of double-stranded breaks in DNA as opposed to HRR. For example, some assays look at the combination of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and large-scale state transitions (LST) across chromosomes as well as telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI) when determining whether a cancer is HRD-positive, while other assays use alternative approaches. How those characteristics are measured, integrated, and distilled into a final determination of whether HRD is present or absent varies, which can create uncertainty around treatment options and enrollment into clinical trials. This also makes the path of follow-on companion diagnostics challenging because perfect agreement between imprecise measurements is unlikely. In order to enable more standardized reporting of HRD and to enable the assessment of HRD assays, we created a set of characterized reference materials composed of HRD negative, borderline, and positive tumor\/normal matched cell lines that were analyzed using both array-based and next generation sequencing-based assays in order to characterize chromosomal changes across their genomes and obtain HRD scores. Because of differences in the results, assay imprecision should be taken into account in clinical trials that implement cutoffs in order to establish safety data for patients who are biomarker-negative but may be biomarker-positive in a future assay, which is similar to what is done for complementary diagnostics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b145709f-d54c-4fed-bc60-21ba714f028d\/@z03B8ZKQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-06 Novel endpoints and biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Homologous recombination,Nonhomologous end joining,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14968"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yves Konigshofer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew G.

To guide development of the novel immune agent GEN-1, we compared endpoints experienced by patients from a recent neoadjuvant single-arm phase Ib study of GEN-1 plus standard chemotherapy to those of similar historical clinical trial patients in receipt of standard chemotherapy alone.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To compare safety and efficacy endpoints following first-line neoadjuvant weekly GEN-1 immunotherapy and carboplatin and paclitaxel to standard first-line neoadjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel in women with advanced ovarian cancer, we first applied key OVATION-1 trial (NCT02480374) inclusion and exclusion criteria to the Medidata Enterprise Data Store (MEDS) data to identify candidate historical clinical trial patients for comparison. We standardized and integrated patient-level MEDS data (N=41) from distinct phase I-III trials (enrollment years 2015-2016) with patient-level OVATION-1 data (N=18). Standard propensity score methods were used to identify MEDS patients who appeared similar to OVATION-1 patients to create a synthetic control arm (SCA).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Fifteen OVATION-1 patients (15\/18, 83%) were matched to 15 (37%, 15\/41) MEDS historical trial control patients. Matching attenuated pre-existing differences in attributes between the OVATION-1 and MEDS patients. The median progression-free survival time was not reached by the OVATION-1 group and was 15.8 months for the SCA. The hazard of progression for the OVATION-1 group relative to the SCA was 0.53 (95% CI 0.16, 1.73). Fourteen of 15 OVATION-1 patients (93.3%) and 15 of the SCA patients (100%, 15\/15) had at least one MedDRA toxicity. Compared to SCA patients, OVATION-1 patients had a slightly higher incidence in nausea (OVATION-1 73.3%; SCA 53.3%), fatigue (OVATION-1 73.3%; SCA 33.3%), anorexia (OVATION-1 46.7%; SCA 13.3%), chills (OVATION-1 26.7%; SCA 6.7%), and infusion-related reaction (OVATION-1 26.7%; SCA 0%).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The comparison of patient endpoints from a single-arm phase Ib trial to a historical clinical trial SCA provided informative and relatively reliable estimates of efficacy endpoints which were used to inform GEN-1&#8217;s expected effect study size in the phase II setting. This information led to a decrease in the number of planned patients for the subsequent randomized phase II trial. More broadly, this approach supports the ability of historical clinical trial patient comparisons to inform drug development via trial design, something which may further increase the scientific value of early phase trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6544bb63-94f8-421c-acd2-70fc4626ea8e\/@z03B8ZKQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-04 Data science and informatics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Immunotherapy,Databases,Statistical approach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18988"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiang Yin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruthanna Davi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Elizabeth B.

Different types of expenditures, including inpatient and outpatient costs for patients with different waiting lengths were compared.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>For patients with moderate lengths of waiting time, medical expenditure and mortality rate increases and length of hospital stay decreased with waiting time. Within 2 years after the index AML diagnosis, the average expenditures per day goes from $4,803 for patients waiting for 0-2 days to $7,489 for patients waiting for 1-2 weeks, while the survival rate goes from 42.8% to 28.1% and the average length of stay goes from 45.6 days to 35.0 days. The increment in medical expenditure is mostly accounted for by outpatient costs, but is off-set by inpatient costs. The patterns for medical expenditure and survival rate reverse as waiting time becomes severe (3-4 weeks). Similar reverse is not observed for length of stay.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The waiting time between AML diagnostic tests and initial treatments is associated with higher medical expenditure and higher mortality rate for moderate waiters. Our findings suggest that reducing waiting time has strong potential in improving AML patients&#8217; survival and financial sustainability.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{0EA73C0E-8106-45D2-9552-5638F6284584}\"><caption>Medical expenditure, survival rate, and length of hospital stay within 2 years by waiting time<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Medical expenditure per day ($)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2-yr Survival rate (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Length of hospital stay (days)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;2d<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4803<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">42.8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">45.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2-7d<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5008<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30.3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">36.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7-14d<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7489<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">28.1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14-28d<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4174<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29.8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;28d<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2224<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">51.0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">35.0<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-06 Value and cost issues in cancer care,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21452"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kang Lin Hsieh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bor-Sheng Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoqian Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teng-Jen Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Fen Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.
