[{"Abstract":"Lung cancer kills more people annually worldwide than any other cancer. Outcomes have improved with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, however, only about 20% of tumors respond. Emerging data demonstrate that responses to ICI may depend on the host microbiome. The challenge is to identify strategies to manipulate the gut microbiome to improve response to ICIs. Here we explore a targeted dietary intervention to modify the microbiome and determine the response to ICIs. Studies in a preclinical murine model showed that freeze-dried black raspberry powder (AIN-76A synthetic diet containing 5% lyophilized black raspberry powder) increased the abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila<\/i>, which has been associated with improved response to ICIs in melanoma. Next, we conducted a human intervention trial called the BEWELL Study (Black raspberry nEctar Working to prEvent Lung cancer NCT04267874). This placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over trial examined the impact of 2x 80 mL black raspberry (BRB) nectar drink boxes per day for 4 weeks. There were 96 participants recruited and classified as being at high risk of developing lung cancer (eligibility criteria: &#62;30 pack-year smoking history and 55-77 years old) in an attempt to match the phenotype of typical lung cancer patients but allowing us to clearly assess the impact of the intervention on the microbiome. Pre- and post-dietary intervention gut microbiome, blood, and urine samples were collected. Black raspberry dietary supplementation was not associated with a significant change in <i>A. muciniphila<\/i> (logistic regression with negative binomial Wald test p-value 0.056), however, changes in other taxa were observed. Finally, stool from participants in the BEWELL study was gavaged into C57BL\/6J mice to create human microbiome avatar models. Mouse colon cancer cells (mc38) were injected subcutaneously and treated with anti-PD1 Ab (5mg\/kg mouse; clone RMP1-14) or isotype control (clone 2A3). Preliminary experiments using avatar mice with post-BRB human microbiomes showed smaller tumors relative to mice receiving stool from that same individual pre-BRB dietary intervention, relative to isotype control (t-test, p-value 0.05). These results suggest that black raspberry nectar may modify the human gut microbiome in a way that promotes an improved response to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/de850bda-6ff9-4324-8c81-fc5a11871231\/@y03B8ZH2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Immunotherapy,Mouse models,Diet,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13901"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amna Bibi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaditya Pallerla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nyelia Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Wheeler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Hoyd<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shankar Suman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Amann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mounika Goruganthu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tamio Okimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangyang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marisa Bittoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ni Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiqi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alvin Anand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Heitman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxine Mendelson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth M.

The mechanism involved in the occurrence of immune-mediated diarrhea and colitis (IMDC) and its potential implication on ICI efficacy remain unclear. The gut microbiome is progressively recognized as a key biomarker of ICI efficacy and preliminary results suggest its potential association with irAE. However, the link between microbiota and IMDC still needs to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated IMDC-associated intestinal bacteria.We performed metagenomics sequencing of baseline pre-ICI fecal samples from 26 advanced melanoma patients and recorded IMDC. Culturomics using MALDI-TOF was used to isolate bacteria from 19 patient samples: 11 IMDC-free (fIMDC), 5 baseline pre-IMDC (pIMDC) and 8 during IMDC (dIMDC). Serum multiplex cytokine panel was measured for 36 patients. Then, we induced colitis with Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) in MCA-205 murine tumor model treated with oral supplementation of human bacteria and ICI.Metagenomics profiling demonstrated lower &#945;-diversity at baseline in patients that developed irAE. Moreover, pIMDC samples present a lower Simpson &#945;-diversity than fIMDC samples (p=0.08). &#223;-diversity was also different between both groups (p=0.10) suggesting a different baseline microbiome composition. Lefse analysis revealed an overrepresentation of <i>Enterococcus faecium <\/i>and <i>Bilophila wadsworthia<\/i> in pIMDC samples compared to fIMDC samples. Culturomics showed that dIMDC samples exhibited a shift in gut microbiota with a significant decrease in bacterial diversity mostly anaerobic species and an enrichment of <i>Clostridium paraputricum<\/i>, <i>Clostridium perfringens,<\/i> <i>Paraclostridium<\/i> <i>bifermentans<\/i> and <i>Paeniclostridium sordelii <\/i>compared to fIMDC and pIMDC samples. Immunological analysis of serum revealed that IMDC patients had a higher concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines including GMCSF (p=0.04), IL12-23p40 (p=0.04) and IL-16 (p=0.03) compared to fIMDC patients. In our DSS-induced colitis mouse model, we showed that <i>P. bifermentans<\/i> oral supplementation related with diarrhea and a shorter colon length, indicating more severe colitis. Moreover, we showed that <i>P. bifermentans<\/i> increased anti-CLTA-4 and anti-PD-1 anti-tumor activity.Results showed that gut microbiota composition of dIMDC patients differed from that of pIMDC and fIMDC patients with a decrease of diversity and colonization of <i>P.bifermentans<\/i> and <i>P.sordelii<\/i>. In IMDC patients, we isolated bacteria that aggravated colitis in murine models and are known to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease. These results provide more insight on potential microbiome-modifying strategies to damper IMDC and increase anti-cancer efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e98f8917-6a58-49c7-be83-e35e00ad6c44\/@y03B8ZH2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gut microbiota,Immune checkpoint blockade,Toxicity,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13910"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Khoudia Diop<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benlaïfaoui Myriam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wiam Belkaïd<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexis Nolin-Lapalme<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie Malo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marion Tonneau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ponce Mayra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Afnan Al-Saleh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catalin Mihalcioiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Watson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arielle Elkrief<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karla Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meriem Messaoudene<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bertrand Routy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Corentin Richard<\/i><\/presenter>.

A dynamic balance between the host immune system and the gut bacterial communities is essential to protect colonic tissues against chronic inflammation, which may lead to CRC. The main goal of this study was to investigate if SNPs in the promoter regions of the <i>IL-1&#946;<\/i>, <i>IL-6<\/i> and <i>IL-10<\/i>, key cytokines that regulate gut inflammation, increase the risk for colorectal adenomas by enriching a subset of the toxin-producing gut microbiota (gene-environment interaction).<br \/>Methods: Using a case-control study design, associations between having pro-inflammatory SNPs and\/or bacterial toxins in colonic mucosa or stool were assessed using odds ratios. TaqMan&#174; SNP Genotyping Assays (ThermoFisher Scientific) for <i>IL- 1&#946;<\/i> (rs1143627), <i>IL-6<\/i> (rs1800795), and <i>IL-10<\/i> (rs1800871) were performed according to the manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations. The presence of bacterial toxin genes (<i>pks, TcPC, GelE, cnf-1, CDT, murB<\/i>, and <i>usp) <\/i>in stool were determined using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN).<br \/>Results: Our preliminary analyses showed that individuals with the IL-1<i>&#946;<\/i> pro-inflammatory genotype were 1.5-times more likely to have colorectal adenomas (n=232; p=0.1). Detection of <i>usp<\/i> or <i>pks<\/i> in stool (n=147) was positively associated with having adenomas (OR=2.95; CI 95%= 0.92-9.45 and OR=2.91; CI 95%=0.58-14.50, respectively).<br \/>Conclusion: An evaluation of the association between having pro-inflammatory genotypes, the presence of bacterial toxin genes in stool, and colorectal adenomas using a larger sample size is warranted and currently underway. The integration of modifiable (e.g. gut bacterial toxins) and non-modifiable (e.g. host genetics) risk factors in a stratified model for CRC risk stratification and\/or prevention may enhance current screening approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f91a4a2e-6bff-4eec-9e99-6af29c1619b0\/@y03B8ZH2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenoma,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Inflammation,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14054"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ibis R.

However, response rate is low in a large proportion of patients. The overall efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy remains unsatisfactory. Recently, live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) have emerged as potential therapeutics to overcome the limitation of immune checkpoint inhibitor. Here, we demonstrated the efficacy of CJRS-10671 and CJRS-10672 in tumor bearing mice models.<br \/>Methods: To evaluate anti-tumor effects, 109 CFU\/mouse CJRS-10671 was administered via oral gavage twice daily (BID) alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 (10 mg\/kg, QOD, i.p.) for 10 days in a Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC1) syngeneic tumor model. Tumor growth was measured by calipers 3 times per week. We analyzed immune cell profiles by flow cytometry. In lung squamous cell carcinoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) model,109 CFU\/mouse CJRS-10671 and CJRS-10672 were orally administered twice daily (BID) alone or in combination with pembrolizumab (10 mg\/kg, Q5D, i.p.) for 35 days. Tumor growth was measured by calipers 3 times per week. We analyzed immune cell profiles and single cell RNA sequencing.<br \/>Results: In LLC1 syngeneic tumor model, CJRS-10671 alone suppressed tumor growth comparable to that of immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 antibody) only treatment group. Combined administration of CJRS-10671 and immune checkpoint inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor growth (p&#60;0.05). We found that combination of CJRS-10671 with anti-PD-1 antibody increased the population of CD8+IFN-&#947;+ cells in splenocytes and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).In humanized PDX model, CJRS-10671 alone significantly suppressed tumor growth compared with that of vehicle control and pembrolizumab only treatment (p&#60;0.001). CJRS-10672 alone suppressed tumor growth compared with that of vehicle control (p&#60;0.001) which is comparable with the efficacy of pembrolizumab alone. Combined administration of CJRS-10672 and pembrolizumab further significantly suppressed tumor growth than pembrolizumab alone (p&#60;0.01). None of the mice in pembrolizumab showed more than 75% tumor growth inhibition cut-off (TGI-75%). Fifty percent of the mice in CJRS-10671 single treated group showed over TGI-75%. The groups of pembrolizumab combination with CJRS-10672, pembrolizumab combination with CJRS-10671, CJRS-10672 alone were observed 25%, 20%, and 11.1%, respectively (&#62;TGI-75%).We confirmed that administration of CJRS-10671 increased population of CD8+ central memory T cells in tumor. Also, TGI (%) directly related features were mostly antigen presentation and monocyte origin cells, especially macrophage in immune-profiling analysis. Furthermore, we observed that CJRS-10671 and CJRS-10672 were associated with signaling of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and especially CJRS-10671 was related to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) signaling by single cell RNA sequencing analysis.<br \/>Conclusion: CJRS-10671 and CJRS-10672, single administration or combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, have potential anti-tumor effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e5fa4ac7-2298-437d-b4ed-8ed4dca08465\/@y03B8ZH2\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bacterial treatment,Lung cancer,Cytotoxic T cell,Pembrolizumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14079"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arim Min<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo-eun Kwon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunjeong Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunkyung Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiyoung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyoung-Ho Pyo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byoung Chul Cho<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this study, we identified microbes to be distinctly abundant in cancer patients who are obese and correlated microbe abundance to patient survival, clinical variables, and immunological genes and pathways, in order to mechanistically explain how differential microbe abundance may influence clinical outcome.<br \/>Methods: Microbial reads were aligned and extracted from raw whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing data of cancer patient samples using Pathoscope 2.0 software. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to correlate body mass index (BMI)-associated microbes to clinical variables. Reactome FIViz and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were used to calculate pathway enrichment.<br \/>Results: We identified specific microbes, including Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and Enterobacter cloacae, and chemokine and interleukin-related genes to be potential determining factors of disease severity among cancer patients in BMI-associated groups. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that microbes abundant in cancer tissue in obese patient samples, including Pseudomonas baetica in liver cancer patients, were significantly associated with the upregulation oncogenic, cell migration-related signaling pathways. Intra-tumor microbes from obese patient samples were also found to correlate with chemokine signaling and TFR2\/NFkB-related genes, both of which have well-established roles in inflammatory activity.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study significantly advances the understanding of the microbiome composition of the tumor microenvironment in patients who are obese and microbes&#8217; relationship with clinical and immunologic variables, particularly inflammatory-related genes and pathways. We uncovered unknown mechanisms of the microbiome-immune interaction and obtained definitive data on microbiome dysbiosis in patients with obesity as a key determinant of severity of cancer, including microbe regulation of inflammasome activity. While deeper sequencing, more rigorous contamination correction, and <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>experiments are necessary to fully elucidate how microbe species can effectively act as therapeutic agents in probiotic and prebiotic therapies to reduce insulin resistance, inflammation, and glucose levels, our results are essential for guiding this future research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3290b58b-0b2d-4f8b-aaee-01909214bdab\/@y03B8ZH2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Inflammation,Obesity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14091"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aditi Gnanasekar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil Shende<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaideep Chakladar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei T.

A growing body of evidence shows that microbial imbalance affects cancer susceptibility and progression. A common significant influence on the microbiota in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the use of antibiotics. Oral antibiotics severely alter the bacteria in the GI tract by destroying beneficial bacteria alongside pathogenic ones &#8212; producing a state of microbial imbalance called dysbiosis. The overall use of antibiotics has increased by more than 30% in recent years, and moreover, many cancer patients are prescribed antibiotics during treatment, as infection is frequently a complication. We hypothesized that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota would suppress cytokine profiles in the host, thereby causing stromal immune surveillance suppression. We found that antibiotics as well as tumorigenesis caused changes in the bacterial abundance, composition, or diversity in the GI tract. On the host side, we found that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis caused the small intestine and cecum to enlarge and elongate, yet the colon was not affected. Moreover, B16-F10 melanoma and Lewis Lung carcinoma progressed more quickly during dysbiosis. Mechanistically, tumor progression was mediated by suppressed TNF-&#945; levels, both locally and systemically. In contrast, IFN-&#947; and VEGF did not change significantly during dysbiosis. The suppressed levels of TNF-&#945;, a pleiotropic regulator of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), resulted in reduced expression of tumor endothelial cell associated ICAM-1, and a subsequent decrease in the number of activated and effector CD8+ T-cells in the tumor. However, suppression of ICAM-1 or its binding site, the alpha subunit of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), was not seen in established vasculature during dysbiosis as assessed in the spleen or the thymus. While dysbiosis enhanced tumor growth in ICAM-1+\/+ and immunocompetent mice, it did not affect tumor growth in ICAM-1-\/- or T-cell deficient mice, highlighting the influence and impact of dysbiosis on T-cell trafficking and extravasation. TNF-&#945; supplementation in dysbiotic mice was able to overcome the dysbiosis-induced suppression as evident by increased ICAM-1 expression, leukocyte trafficking and tumor growth inhibition. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of commensal bacteria in supporting immune surveillance and expand our understanding of the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the stroma in distal non-GI tract tumors. Moreover, this knowledge has the potential to influence clinical decision-making when treating patients for solid cancers with dysbiosis-inducing antibiotics and may further inform concurrent and (neo-)adjuvant treatments to overcome the adverse effects of the antibiotics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5d5fcdd2-6814-42c3-95f5-2811274583a4\/@y03B8ZH2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14576"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Samir V.
