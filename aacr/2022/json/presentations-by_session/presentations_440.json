[{"Abstract":"The importance of metabolic reprogramming in cancer has been long demonstrated by the association of systemic metabolic changes, such as aging, diet and exercise, with cancer outcomes. These systemic shifts, combined with local metabolic alterations within the tumor microenvironment (TME), can all cooperate to foster an environment conducive to cancer progression. In cells derived from primary and metastatic patient tumors, we found that mesenchymal-like cells displayed dysregulated propionate metabolism, leading to increased accumulation and secretion of methylmalonic acid (MMA), a novel aging-induced oncometabolite. This tumor cell-secreted MMA, in addition to increased MMA in the serum of elderly individuals, combine to form high local accumulation of MMA in the TME. We discovered that MMA acts on fibroblasts in the TME, activating them to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). MMA modifies the cargo of CAF-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), which function as a messenger to tumor cells, further promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, drug resistance, and increased metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>. Here, we reveal a novel function of MMA in cancer, demonstrating for the first time that tumor-secreted MMA recruits the tumor microenvironment to drive cancer progression and metastatic reprogramming.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e9f7e54-c1d8-4c90-8dc6-64dbebe163cd\/@G03B8ZKX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Tumor microenvironment,Cancer metabolism,Extracellular vesicles,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11439"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vivien Low<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhongchi Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Laughney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenbing Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noah Dephoure<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valbona Luga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ethan Earlie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bobak Parang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunjun Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lewis Cantley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Blenis<\/i><\/presenter>.

Patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) have a 5-year survival rate at 14%. We previously showed that liver endothelial cells (EC), a key component of the liver microenvironment, secrete soluble factors to promote CRC growth and chemoresistance via activating human epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB3, also known as HER3). However, we found that the ECs activated HER3 by a previously unknown mechanism that is independent of the established HER3 ligand neuregulins. Identifying a new HER3 ligand will potentially give rise to novel therapeutic target for treating patients with mCRC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We first fractionated conditioned medium (CM) from liver ECs by fast protein liquid chromatography. The specific fractions that activated HER3 and AKT in CRC cells were subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) for protein identification. In parallel, we used a His-tagged HER3 Extracellular domain (ECD) and pulled down EC-secreted factors that directly bound to HER3 and then subjected to protein identification by MS. Candidate proteins identified in both MS analyses were subjected for further validations by siRNA or immunoprecipitation depletion from EC CM to determine their roles in HER3 activation and CRC growth.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified a specific fraction of liver EC CM increased phosphorylation of HER3 and AKT in CRC cells (determined by Western blotting). Meanwhile, the HER3-ECD affinity binding assay showed that HER3 ECD-depleted EC CM could no longer activate HER3 or promote growth, and the soluble factor(s) eluted from HER3-ECD increased phosphorylation of HER3 and AKT, and promoted growth in CRC cells. Results from both MS analyses revealed that LRG1 is a potential ligand that binds to and activate HER3 in CRC cells. We depleted LRG1 from EC CM, either by siRNA knockdown LRG1 in ECs or immunoprecipitation, and found that LRG1-depleted EC CM could no longer activate HER3 and AKT in CRC cells, and LRG1-depleted EC CM failed to promote growth of CRC cell in vitro and CRC xenografts in vivo.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We identified LRG1 as a new HER3 ligand and demonstrated that liver EC-secreted LRG1 mediates EC paracrine effects on activating HER3 and promoting CRC cell growth. Our findings suggest an oncogenic role of EC-secreted LRG1 in the surrounding liver microenvironment of mCRC, and highlighted a potential of blocking LRG1 with monoclonal antibodies for treating patients with mCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/be4f2593-4d43-4969-be67-192146a919c0\/@G03B8ZKX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endothelial cells,Colorectal,HER3,LRG1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11441"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Moeez Ghani Rathore<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michel'le Wright<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Winter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yamu Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenghe Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, malignant cells exhibit altered signaling pathways, which enables them to adapt to both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic stressors within TME. The activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a master transcriptional effector of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), a homeostatic mechanism coupling cell growth and survival to bioenergetic demands. We and others have established a critical tumor cell-intrinsic role of ATF4 which culminates in the promotion of primary tumor growth and in the establishment of micro- and macro-metastases in xenograft, allograft and transgenic models. However, the potential roles of the ISR and particularly of ATF4-mediated responses in host-dependent, tumor-related processes, have not been yet extensively investigated. Using novel conditional knockout ATF4 mouse models, we show that global loss of host ATF4 results in deficient tumor vascularization and a pronounced tumor growth delay in syngeneic melanoma and pancreatic tumor models. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a severely impaired angiogenic phenotype in tumors grown in ATF4 KO mice which was accompanied by deficiencies in markers of CAF activation. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of B16F10 melanoma tumors further localized this defect to a distinct CAF population, previously identified as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), and revealed a significant reduction in the expression of extracellular matrix components, primarily type I collagen, in tumors grown in ATF4 KO mice. Intriguingly, we identified a multifaceted impairment of the collagen biosynthetic pathway with the ATF4 to directly regulate the expression of the Col1a1 gene as well as the intracellular levels of glycine and proline, the major amino acids comprising collagen fibers. Moreover, we showed that the ATF4-deficient vCAFs secrete significantly lower levels of angiogenic factors (i.e., VEGF, SDF-1 etc.) in the perivascular area leading to an abnormal angiogenesis and significant attenuation of tumor growth. Specific deletion of ATF4 in the fibroblast compartment (Col1a1 promoter) produced a similar tumor growth delay as in the global ATF4 KO mice, and notably, co-injection of fibroblasts from ATF4-proficient mice led to significant recovery of tumor growth rates in ATF4-deficient mice. Finally, analysis of human melanoma and pancreatic tumor samples revealed a strong correlation between ATF4 and collagen levels and between an ISR gene signature and expression of collagen and CAF activation genes. Our findings uncover a novel role of stromal ATF4 in shaping CAF functionality, a key driver of disease progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/20981c8d-df12-4799-9555-83a1570c81cd\/@G03B8ZKX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Angiogenesis,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11442"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ioannis I.

While tumor genomic evolution is one possible mechanism whereby cancer cells acquire chemotherapy resistance during the metastatic process, increasing evidence demonstrates that non-cancerous cells within the secondary organ have crucial roles in mediating metastasis and therapy resistance. Therefore, disrupting tumor-stromal cell interactions is an exploitable therapeutic strategy to improve outcomes. Unfortunately, mechanistic insight into tumor-stromal interactions is limited for most cancers. Osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone tumor that primarily afflicts children and young adults, displays an overwhelming propensity for metastasis to the lungs, with overall survival plummeting to less than 20% at 5 years upon lung metastasis. Why osteosarcoma displays tropism for the lung and how it educates the lung to promote tumor growth in a vastly different microenvironment from the primary tumor remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to define the cellular and molecular landscape of osteosarcoma metastases in immunocompetent mouse models. We unexpectedly found that alveolar epithelial cells are the most prominent non-immune stromal component within lung metastases. Not only are they present in significant numbers in lung metastases compared to unaffected lung, our molecular analysis demonstrated that tumor associated epithelial cells acquire a pro-fibrosis &#8216;wound-like&#8217; phenotype, which was also observed in human metastasis samples. Furthermore, utilizing human and mouse culture systems, we found that osteosarcoma cells directly reprogramed epithelial cells through secretion of growth factors and cytokines such as FGF7 and IL6. These profibrotic epithelial cells in turn induced osteosarcoma cells to generate a complex, beta-1integrin (ITGB1)- dependent fibronectin matrix. The epithelial induced fibronectin matrix promoted osteosarcoma invasion and chemotherapy resistance. Accordingly, inhibition of ITGB1 sensitized osteosarcoma cells to chemotherapy. Collectively our results demonstrate that osteosarcoma cells educate the lung microenvironment into a &#8216;pro-wound&#8217;, pro-fibrosis state that is conducive to osteosarcoma lung colonization. Disruption of the lung metastatic niche is a promising therapeutic target for sensitizing osteosarcoma cells to chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1f6b9278-f80b-4ee8-92e0-a60b4f43c39b\/@G03B8ZKX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Metastasis,Osteosarcoma,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11443"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James Brandon Reinecke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Gross<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maren Cam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Roberts<\/i><\/presenter>.

Identifying suitable targets that are tractable, ubiquitous and safe, however, has proven to be more challenging. Almost a decade ago we reported that a secreted glycoprotein, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1), was induced in ocular neovascular complications and contributed to the formation of dysfunctional neovessels<sup>1<\/sup>. More recently, we have reported that LRG1 is expressed in experimental and human tumors, and that its inhibition with a function-blocking antibody improves outcome in multiple primary<sup>2<\/sup> and metastatic<sup>3<\/sup> models of cancer. Crucially, we found that LRG1 blockade normalizes tumor vessels and enhances the efficacy of cisplatin, adoptive T cell and checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and that a humanized version of our blocking antibody named Magacizumab effectively inhibits tumour growth both alone and as an antibody-drug-conjugate<sup>4<\/sup>.Using animal models and in vitro assays we present here further data in support of LRG1 as a promising target for the treatment of solid cancers. We have further investigated the effects of LRG1 blockade on immune cell infiltration using flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analysis. In subcutaneous B16 melanoma-bearing mice treated with a PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, antibody blockade of LRG1 significantly enhanced the infiltration of CD3<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells, with the latter exhibiting a more activated phenotype as evidenced by higher GrzB, reduced PD1<sup>hi <\/sup>expression and increased proliferation. We also observed a reduction in the Tregs:Th ratio and a higher number of MHCII<sup>+<\/sup> cells. These outcomes were also observed in LLC tumors alongside a reduction in the number of infiltrated neutrophils. In preliminary studies, where we investigated LRG1 blockade in the Rag1 mouse, we observed no effect suggesting that the downstream mode of action is mediated by impacting the immune system. Finally, to test the development of our humanized anti-LRG1 antibody Magacizumab, that only recognizes human LRG1, we demonstrated its efficacy in B16F0 tumors grown in a human LRG1 knock-in mouse. These studies provide compelling evidence that LRG1 is a novel, legitimate and potentially efficacious target for the treatment of various human solid cancers. References:Wang X et al. (2013).

Studies show that Western-style diet-induced obesity promote CRC by modulating gut inflammatory mediators. We found significant increase in IL-23 levels (p&#60;0.0001) in obese human subjects' plasma (n=15\/arm; BMI&#62;30) and its . over expression in colonic tumors (CT) from human and rodent models that highly correlated with, the TCGA gene expression &#38; disease-free survival data. These findings suggested IL-23 as a possible important link between obesity and colon tumorigenesis. The present study was designed to understand the role of IL-23 in colorectal carcinogenesis by using genetic knockout (KO) approach. For this study, Apc<sup>min\/+<\/sup> and IL-23 KO mice were crossbred to generate Apc<sup>min\/+<\/sup> mice with IL-23 in heterozygous or KO conditions. To determine the effect of IL-23 on intestinal tumorigenesis, six-week-old Apc<sup>min\/+ <\/sup>mice (N&#8805;15\/gender) were grouped by IL-23 genotype i.e., normal (+\/+), heterozygous (+\/-) and KO (-\/-) conditions, then maintained under standard conditions. At 20 weeks of age, all mice were euthanized and intestines were evaluated and compared for tumors incidence and multiplicity. Genetic ablation of IL-23 led to significant suppression of large and small intestinal tumors of APCmin\/+ mice in both genders. CT multiplicity of male and female IL-23+\/+ Apc<sup>min\/+ <\/sup>mice were 1.35&#177;0.16 (Mean&#177;SEM) and 0.61&#177;0.13, respectively. Male and female IL-23+\/- Apc<sup>min\/+<\/sup> mice had 77% (0.31+0.15; p&#60;0.0001) and 90% (0.06+0.09; p&#60;0.002) inhibition of CTs, respectively. Interestingly, IL-23 KO led to further suppression in male mice (96% inhibition in male; 0.05+0.05; p&#60;0.0001 and 90% in females; 0.06+0.06; p&#60;0.0001). While IL-23+\/+ Apc<sup>min\/+ <\/sup>mice was 91% and 52% CT incidence in the male and female mice, respectively. CT incidence was suppressed by 72% (male, p&#60;0.0001) &#38; 88% (female, p&#60;0.005) in the IL-23+\/- mice, with further suppression to 95% (male, p&#60;0.0001) &#38; 89% (female, p&#60;0.0025) inhibition in IL-23 KO mice. The strong suppressive effect of IL-23 knockdown was also observed on the small intestinal polyps (SIP) multiplicity. There was a 54% (12.56&#177;1.64; p&#60;0.0001) and 58% (11.45&#177;1.03; p&#60;0.0001) reduction in SIP number in IL23+\/- and IL23-\/- male Apc<sup>min\/+ <\/sup>mice, compared to the IL-23+\/+ control mice (27.48&#177;2.38). In female, 55-59% (13.88&#177;1.05 and 12.73&#177;2.03; p&#60;0.0001) less SIP were observed with IL-23 ablation compared to control (30.90&#177;2.54). Apc<sup>min\/+ <\/sup>with IL-23 KO showed significant reduction in circulating proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines (Ex: IL-1, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23, CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-5, TNFa, IFNg) levels compared to IL-23 WT mice. These results clearly demonstrate the colon tumor-promoting role of IL-23 and strengthens our hypothesis to explore this target for CRC prevention in high-risk obese individuals.

It is now widely accepted that there are different cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subtypes with different functions and effects on tumor progression. Since CAFs are generally considered an emerging therapeutic target, it is crucial to identify those subtypes that are tumor-promoting and to characterize their driver pathways. In this study we describe a population of CAFs in prostate cancer (PCa) that express elevated levels of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) and localize adjacent to tumor foci. We previously showed that Nox4 is essential for TGF&#946;-mediated differentiation to a myofibroblastic CAF phenotype and that its increased expression is associated with biochemical relapse and reduced survival. Thus, this study aims to investigate whether pharmacological Nox4 inhibition can be used as an adjuvant therapeutic approach in PCa and which molecular pathways are regulated by Nox4 in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Experiments using GKT831, a small molecule Nox1\/Nox4 inhibitor with promising effects in clinical trials for fibrotic diseases, so far support its use as a therapeutic target. Most importantly, Nox4 inhibition reduced CAF marker expression in primary prostate CAFs and attenuated the expression of PSA, the key clinical biomarker of PCa progression, in <i>ex vivo <\/i>cultured human PCa tissue. The translational application of Nox4 inhibition is currently under investigation <i>in vivo<\/i> using CAF-PCa cell xenografts. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulated by Nox4 we performed integrative bioinformatics and functional assays, which revealed that Nox4 regulates CAF adhesion and migration. In addition, we found that Nox4 regulated genes were associated with a YAP signature and the transcription factor TEAD1, a major cofactor of YAP. Ongoing experiments suggest that during adhesion Nox4 signals via oxidation of SHP2, a redox-sensitive phosphatase that has previously been implicated in regulating YAP transcriptional activity.<br \/>Previous studies have shown that adhesion and mechanotransduction pathways are commonly altered in myofibroblastic CAFs and that they support the formation of a tumor-promoting microenvironment. Our data suggest that Nox4 acts as a central regulator of these key oncogenic pathways and thus represents a promising therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd2d718b-c93a-4042-ab70-20bbb88ee92e\/@G03B8ZKX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Redox,Nox4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11458"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elena Brunner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucy Neumann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabeth Damisch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Puhr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georg Schäfer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cédric Szyndralewiez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helmut Klocker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Sampson<\/i><\/presenter>.

Previously, we validated the functional significance of the cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1)-ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) signaling axis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and generated a high-affinity soluble receptor (eCNTFR-Fc) that sequesters CLCF1, thereby inhibiting its oncogenic effects. eCNTFR-Fc inhibits tumor growth in multiple xenograft models and in an autochthonous, highly aggressive genetically engineered mouse model of LUAD, driven by activation of oncogenic <i>Kras <\/i>and loss of <i>Trp53<\/i>. Abrogation of CLCF1 through eCNTFR-Fc appears most effective in tumors driven by oncogenic <i>KRAS<\/i>. From our genetically engineered mouse and our syngeneic modelling of LUAD we have observed that eCNTFR seems to work via two mechanisms, firstly in a tumor intrinsic fashion where it may modulate altered guanosine triphosphate loading, as we see differential effectiveness of eCNTFR-Fc, depending on the presence of <i>KRAS <\/i>mutations that retain the intrinsic capacity to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate. Alternatively, eCNTFR also effects the tumor microenvironment and alters the composition of the tumor immune infiltrate, where using single cell genomics we see vast changes to the myeloid compartment, and alteration of the CAF populations, which we have previously shown to be the primary location of CLCF1 expression in mouse LUAD. To further enhance the efficacy of eCNTFR-Fc we have identified potential targets for combination therapy from both the autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms of eCNTFR-Fc. We conclude that eCNTFR-Fc acts through two distinct mechanisms to be a highly effective treatment for Kras mutant LUAD, and combining eCNTER with targets, identified by a rational combination approach, could further enhance its therapeutic potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4d992916-5f75-42fa-9b62-686e85f8a4fe\/@G03B8ZKX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,KRAS,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11460"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kieren D.

The role of keratinocytes in shaping the melanoma tumor microenvironment, however, remains understudied. We previously showed that the keratinocyte-specific desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) is reduced in response to acute UV exposure. Here, we show that Dsg1 protein is reduced in keratinocytes surrounding melanoma lesions but is unchanged in keratinocytes adjacent to benign nevi. As Dsg1 reduction by UV exposure is transient, we hypothesized that the persistent loss of Dsg1 observed in the melanoma tumor niche is due to melanoma-keratinocyte paracrine crosstalk. To address this idea, keratinocytes were cultured in conditioned media from melanocytes or melanoma cells. Melanoma conditioned media reduced keratinocyte Dsg1 mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that Dsg1 downregulation in keratinocytes is maintained by melanoma cells post-transformation. Keratinocytes in melanoma conditioned media exhibited reduced Grhl1 (Grainyhead like 1), a transcriptional activator of Dsg1, and increased Snai2, a repressor of Grhl1 expression and epidermal differentiation. These data support the idea that increased Snai2 stimulated by factors secreted by melanoma cells reduces keratinocyte Dsg1 mRNA expression by repressing Grhl1. To determine the impact of keratinocyte Dsg1 loss on melanoma cell behavior, melanoma cells were grown in conditioned media from control or Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes. Melanoma cell migration increased in a trans-well assay when melanoma cells were grown in conditioned media from Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes compared to from control keratinocytes. Supporting the in vivo importance of this finding, we found a significant, negative correlation between keratinocyte Dsg1 expression and melanoma cell movement within the melanoma tumor niche in patient samples. Downregulation of keratinocyte Dsg1 by melanoma cell conditioned media increased Erk1\/2 signaling upstream of pro-migratory CXCL1 production, while pharmacological inhibition of keratinocyte Erk1\/2 abrogated this effect. Furthermore, inhibition of the CXCL1 receptor, CXCR2 on melanoma cells decreased migration in melanoma cells grown in Dsg1-depleted keratinocyte conditioned media. Together, these data support the idea that paracrine crosstalk between melanoma cells and keratinocytes resulting in chronic keratinocyte Dsg1 reduction is important for melanoma progression and melanoma cell movement in the early stages of metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c0dba11-2be3-417a-a8c4-0092ac9bb87a\/@G03B8ZKX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Motility,Keratinocytes,Paracrine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11461"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hope E.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a key tumor stroma component, which can affect cancer progression and drug response. We hypothesized that defining the differential secreted proteins between CAFs and <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant-cancer cells could reveal potential mechanisms by which CAFs influence cancer progression and drug resistance.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We studied 12 cell lines: 3 <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant-colorectal cancer cell lines (H747, LIM2099 and SW620), 3 <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant-lung cancer cell lines (H1792, H2030 and H23), 3 <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant-pancreatic cancer cell lines (CAPAN1, DANG, MIAPACA2) and 3 CAF cell line models (colorectal and lung CAF and pancreatic stellate cells). We quantified proteins in cell lines and serum-free media after 24 hour incubation in cells using mass spectrometry in a multiplexed manner (12plex) in triplicates to characterize the proteome and the profile of secreted proteins (secretome), respectively. Prediction software (signalP, secretomeP, TMHMM) and databases (surfaceome and cell surface protein atlas) were used to annotate secreted or transmembrane proteins.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Our proteome analysis quantified 9307 proteins. T-test between the cell types (CAF vs cancer) identified 1770 differentially expressed proteins, where 712 proteins were CAF-enriched. This included known CAF markers (e.g &#945; smooth muscle actin) but also proteins not known to be CAF markers such as heat shock protein beta-5\/6 (HSPB5\/6). The secretome analysis identified 2330 secreted or transmembrane proteins where 202 were differentially expressed between cancer cells and CAFs. 190 proteins were CAF-enriched with the highest ranking being syndecan-2 (SDC2), collagen &#945;-28(I) chain (COL28A1), decorin (DCN) and wnt family member 5B (WNT5B).

Recurrence in EOC is driven by the survival of chemoresistant, stem-like tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that are supported by a complex extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive microenvironment. To target TICs to prevent recurrence, we identified genes critical for TIC viability from a whole genome siRNA screen. A top hit was the cancer-associated, ECM synthesis enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH). Immunohistochemistry was used to delineate UGDH expression in histological and molecular subtypes of EOC. Clustering analysis was performed to characterize EOC cell lines to aligned to the molecular subtypes observed in tumors. UGDH expression was modulated in the cell lines using inducible shRNA, and the effects on TICs and on the cells in the supporting microenvironment were examined. High UGDH expression was observed in the majority of high-grade serous ovarian cancers and variable expression was observed in clear cell, mucinous and endometrioid histotypes. A distinctive survival prognostic for UGDH expression was revealed when serous cancers were stratified by molecular subtype, where high UGDH was associated with a poor prognosis in the mesenchymal subtype. Using OV90 as a representative cell line for the mesenchymal subtype, we examined the effect of UGDH knockdown on the tumor cells alone, and on mesothelial support cells in co-culture with the tumor cells. Knock down of UGDH in the OV90 cells reduced the viability, sphere-formation and colony formation capacity of TICs and reduced extracellular hyaluronan production. Knocking down UGDH in the tumors affected the mesothelial cells in co-culture by significantly reducing the expression of ECM signaling and remodeling proteins Versican, Vitronectin, Laminin and matrix metalloprotease 1. These data show that modulation of UGDH expression in tumors influences cells in the microenvironment and reveal a distinct role for UGDH in the mesenchymal molecular subtype of EOC. UGDH is a strong prospective therapeutic target in TICs, for the treatment of metastatic and recurrent EOC, particularly in patients with the mesenchymal molecular subtype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ead782f-33c3-4e36-b867-1e495a8091b7\/@H03B8ZKY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Tumor initiating cells,Molecular subtypes,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11463"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brittney S.

The dynamic processes underpinning cancer\/tumor microenvironment (TME) interactions are poorly understood. We examined the TME remodeling in response to secretory cues provided by the brain niche components that attract metastatic cancer cells. We identified individual secretions by cell type in the niche. Dkk1 was regulated in response to the brain niche cells exposure to cancer cells; thus, we delineated how Dkk1 modulates the remodeling of the niche and migratory behavior of the cancer cells. We utilized two <i>in vitro<\/i> microfluidic devices: 1) a blood brain niche (BBN) chip that recapitulates the BBB and brain TME; 2) a migration chip that assesses linear cell migration.<br \/>The BBN chip consists of two-chambers separated by a porous membrane. The bottom is filled with human astrocytes or their secretions in collagen to recapitulate the pre-metastatic niche. Endothelial cells (hCMEC\/D3) form a barrier on the membrane separating the two chambers. MDA-231-BR extravasate into BBN chips containing astrocytes within 2-Days, develop into micro-metastases after 9-Days, and establish cancer &#8211; astrocyte contacts. Providing astrocytic secretions in BBN chips produced similar results. Increased interaction was found between brain seeking clones of MDA-MB-231 and JIMT-1 cells and astrocytes compared to parental cells. Analysis of astrocytic and endothelial secretions detected, amongst others, Dkk-1, that is preferentially elevated in astrocytes when stimulated with MDA-231-BR compared to MDA-231.<br \/>The migration chip was utilized to assess the impact of Dkk-1 on cancer cell migration. Dkk-1 gradients are established using passive diffusion, then migration is monitored. Neither 231-BR or 231 increase migration towards a Dkk-1 gradient. Instead, both increase migration when directly stimulated with Dkk-1 and then exposed to an external chemotactic gradient of FBS, indicating cancer exposure to Dkk-1 produced within the BBN may promote cancer cell migration. Strikingly, Dkk-1 neutralization in BBN chips with astrocytes reduces 231-BR extravasation across the BBB, decreases migration within the brain niche space, and disrupts cancer&#8211;astrocyte contacts, suggesting Dkk-1 is a critical cytokine that promotes brain metastasis.<br \/>Thirty genes were significantly differentially expressed with Dkk-1 stimulation. The top 3, MDA-231-BR expressed genes FGF-13, PLCB1, and MYC are involved in important oncological pathways: Ras, PI3K, MAPK, Wnt suggesting the plasticity of metastatic cancer permits the cells to adapt to the brain TME. An FGF-13 knockdown of the cells showed Dkk1 effects are partially reduced migration in the brain tropic cells in Dkk1 stimulated conditions. We conclude that the cancer response to Dkk-1 is one critical interaction amenable to therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2fd8e443-6a8c-41dc-aa74-0c642f57544b\/@H03B8ZKY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Microenvironment,Blood-brain barrier,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11464"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher Ryan Oliver<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trisha M.

The propensity for metastasis is a driving factor for the poor outcomes associated with this disease, but there is currently no effective therapy targeting metastasis. Work from our lab has demonstrated that stromal cell expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2) promotes ovarian cancer metastasis. One stromal compartment that expresses DDR2 is the mesothelial cell layer that surrounds the organs of the peritoneum - the most common location of ovarian cancer metastasis. Although epithelial in origin, mesothelial cells can adopt mesenchymal properties during metastasis and become active participants in the process. Therefore, we hypothesize that mesothelial cell expression of DDR2 promotes stabilization of a mesenchymal phenotype in mesothelial cells, which facilitates ovarian cancer metastasis.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) were isolated from patient omentum samples. HPMCs were immortalized using lentivirus expressing SV40 large T antigen followed by short hairpin control and DDR2 knockdown transfections. qPCR was used to assess transcription and immunoblotting was used to assess protein expression. ELISAs were completed to observe changes in MMP-2 secretion. C57BL6\/J mice are used for <i>in vivo <\/i>studies.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b><i>In vitro<\/i> we have found that DDR2-expressing human peritoneal mesothelial cells promote tumor cell clearance through the mesothelial cell layer. Further, mesothelial cell DDR2 increases mesenchymal-associated gene transcription and signaling, including the mesenchymal associated transcription factor SNAI1 and collagen 1. Mesothelial cell DDR2 expression also leads to increased secretion of the protease MMP-2, which is known to promote metastasis. To determine whether mesothelial cell DDR2 expression contributes to metastasis, we are creating a mesothelial cell-specific DDR2 knockout mouse and control mouse. To do so, we are breeding WT1<sup>CreERT2\/+<\/sup> mice as a mesothelial cell specific driver of Cre recombination with DDR2 floxed mice to knockout DDR2 as a result of Cre recombination, and Ai14 mice as a Cre reporter as they express tdTomato only in the presence of Cre. After validation of the model, syngeneic ovarian cancer cells will be intraperitoneally injected and tumor burden, ECM structure, and signaling changes will be compared between knockout and control mice.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This work will increase our understanding of mesothelial cells&#8217; contribution to metastasis with the possibility of identifying inhibition of DDR2 as a therapeutic target for ovarian cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9c9d4f8f-591e-4c5e-b917-b796845ef889\/@H03B8ZKY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peritoneal metastasis,Ovarian cancer,Stroma,Mesothelium,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11465"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Angela Schab<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Lomonosova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isaac Cooper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Teng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zainab Ibitoye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danny Wilke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hollie Noia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maggie Mullen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Longmore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Fuh<\/i><\/presenter>.

The PDAC stroma involves multiple players, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). These stromal cells, when activated, promote extensive fibrosis in PDAC, which is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance.<br \/>We have previously established that the RNA-binding protein Human Antigen R (HuR, <i>ELAVL1<\/i>) facilitates PDAC progression. In a tumor microarray of matched normal and malignant patient tissues, we found high active (i.e. cytoplasmic) HuR staining in 80% of PDAC tumors, while low or absent in adjacent normal tissues (n=80). Moreover, in both the orthotopic and the genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC, active HuR staining in tumors was dramatically higher than in normal pancreas. Pancreas-specific overexpression of HuR in a transgenic mouse model did not initiate tumorigenesis, but did increase fibrosis compared to control mice. We hypothesize that tumor intrinsic HuR regulates transcripts that are needed for tumor cells to activate the surrounding stroma.<br \/>Methods: MiaPaCa-2 or PANC-1 human PDAC cells, either HuR-proficient or CRISPR-mediated knocked-out, were used in an orthotopic model where cells were injected into the tail of the pancreas. Both NRG and athymic mice were used. Resulting tumors underwent immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, or RNA-sequencing. Secreted proteins from cells in 2D culture were analyzed using a cytokine array.<br \/>Results: HuR knockout tumors showed a decrease in CAF and PSC markers (i.e. podoplanin, alpha-SMA, desmin; &#62;55% decrease, p&#60;0.05), as well as a decrease in collagen deposition (56% decrease, p=0.0004). Additionally, HuR expression in tumors positively correlated with collagen abundance (p= 0.0002).<br \/>RNA sequencing of PDAC tumors at various times during tumor development found that gene expression of stroma-activating ligands was significantly downregulated in HuR knockout tumors (e.g. TGFb, CCL2, PDGFA; -0.8&#60;log2FC&#60;-3.6, 0.0009&#60;padj&#60;2^-57). Moreover, we found a significant decrease of these stroma-activating ligands in conditioned media obtained from HuR knockout compared to wild type (e.g. PDGFAA, PTX3, CCL2; &#62;50% decrease, p&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusions: We found inhibition of HuR led to a robust decrease in stroma activation (i.e. lack of collagen, CAFs, and PSCs). To our knowledge, this is the first report of PDAC tumor intrinsic HuR having an extrinsic effect on neighboring stromal cells. Specifically, we found loss of HuR results in a decrease of secreted stroma-activating ligands, likely to be the cause of the decreased fibrosis in HuR knockout tumors. With evidence that fibrosis is associated with poor survival rates and chemoresistance, inhibiting HuR may sensitize tumors to standard of care therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/61ff589b-cb6e-48df-8524-715bb468a148\/@H03B8ZKY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Stroma,Tumor microenvironment,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11466"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Grace A.

Most NPCs respond well to chemoradiation. Nevertheless, approximately 20% of patients experience recurrence and distant metastasis. Tumor desmoplastic responses and high densities of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within tumors have been correlated with poorer prognosis. In this study, we demonstrate that EBV activates fibroblasts via exosomes to remodel a pro-tumoral microenvironment. Exosomes derived from NPC cells contained a high level of fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP&#945;) and EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Treating primary fibroblasts with these exosomes induced functional changes resembling CAFs. Transcriptomic analysis on exosome-treated fibroblasts revealed genes involved in fibrosis-associated pathways were enriched. Noticeably, treating with EBV products-containing exosomes in fibroblasts enhanced the production of several immune-suppressive cytokines, including IL6, IL8, and MCP-1. Moreover, stimulation with these exosomes enhanced activation of YAP1 signaling, a key pathway linking to fibrosis. The <i>in vivo <\/i>mouse xenografted NPC studies showed that EBV products-containing exosomes markedly enhanced the severity of tissue fibrosis and tumor growth. IHC analysis on mouse NPC xenografts and human NPC biopsies showed a positive correlation between levels of nuclear YAP1 and FAP&#945;, which were further correlated with an enhanced fibrotic response within tumors. Pharmaceutical intervention with YAP1 inhibitors blocked the exosome-mediated effects on fibroblasts. Collectively, our data suggest that EBV products-containing exosome is a causal factor in CAF formation, which constitutes a pro-tumoral microenvironment to benefit the survival of both tumor and virus itself.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7659658a-3b80-40c9-9c6a-c30bf709be14\/@H03B8ZKY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),Exosomes,Fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11467"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Po-Ju Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun-Hua Sui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chen-Han Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tzu-Tung Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ngan-Ming Tsang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shu-Chen Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

About 5-7% of NSCLC shows constitutive activation of oncogenic <u>a<\/u>naplastic <u>l<\/u>ymphoma <u>k<\/u>inase (ALK). Though clinical introduction of tyrosine kinases inhibitors (TKIs) for ALK, has improved patient survival, it did not translate into cures as acquired resistance inevitably emerges in patients with advanced and metastatic cancers. While some of the tumor cells are capable of surviving therapy due to their intrinsic characteristics, inability of therapies to eliminate all of the tumor cells also reflects a contribution by microenvironmental factors. As a major cellular component of tumor microenvironment, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as the key determinant of environmental protection. Many <i>in-vitro<\/i> studies implicated CAF-produced paracrine factors can dramatically blunt the effect of TKIs by providing alternative mitogenic and survival signals. While the ability of CAFs to protect tumor cells from TKI is well documented <i>in-vitro<\/i>, whether the impact of stromal protection is relevant <i>in-vivo<\/i> remains unresolved. To study the impact of CAF in response to ALK TKI, we isolated multiple derivatives of CAFs from patient&#8217;s tumor resections. Consistent with previously reported studies we observed that co-culture as well as conditioned media from CAFs protects tumor cells against ALK TKIs. This degree of protection <i>in-vitro<\/i> was highly correlated with the level of <u>h<\/u>epatocyte <u>g<\/u>rowth <u>f<\/u>actor (HGF) measured from each CAF isolates. To study the impact of HGF-mediated protection to tumor cells <i>in-vivo<\/i>, we took advantage of inability of murine HGF to activate its unique receptor cMET in human cells. Specifically, we compared response of tumors to the frontline ALK TKI: alectinib between tumors growing in regular NSG xenografts and those grown in NSG derivate with humanized HGF. Contrary to our <i>in-vitro<\/i> based expectations, we observed only minor differences in tumor responses between the two strains. Using spatial histology analyses, we found that rather than irrelevance of HGF-cMET axis <i>in-vivo<\/i>, this lack of substantial differences reflected strong HGF independent stromal protection effect. which was maintained through different phases of tumor responses, including relapse. Surprisingly, this protection was partially retained in relapsing tumors, suggesting that stroma can contribute not only to persistence, but also to resistance. Our ongoing efforts are focused on determining what molecular mechanisms underlying stromal protection <i>in-vivo, <\/i>and on interplay between cell-intrinsic and stromal resistance. Addressing these questions will provide knowledge necessary to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies against ALK+ NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/31e2dbc9-ef89-4379-a63a-be351a1226b9\/@H03B8ZKY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Therapy resistance,ALK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11468"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bina Desai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Viktoriya Marusyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daria Miroshnychenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chandler Gatenbee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uwe Rix<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Haura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andriy Marusyk<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the primary producers of matrix proteins and remodeling enzymes that cross-link and degrade matrix proteins. CAFs are enigmatic in that they can promote or impede tumor growth, suggesting heterogeneity that is not completely understood. How CAF heterogeneity evolves over tumor progression and how this evolution impacts ECM remodeling within solid tumors remain an outstanding question across cancer models. Recent studies have focused on CAF function in models of adult cancer, but little attention has been directed toward understanding CAF heterogeneity and ECM remodeling in childhood cancers, which are etiologically different diseases. Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood cancer of neuroendocrine cells that accounts for 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. Like other solid tumors, the NB tumor microenvironment includes malignant cells, CAFs, and immune cells. Our laboratory studies NB using a penetrant, spontaneous model of NB (<i>TH<\/i>-<i>MYCN<\/i>, <i>Alk<\/i><sup>F1178L\/+<\/sup>) in immunocompetent mice, allowing <i>in vivo<\/i> investigation of the tumor immune microenvironment from tumorigenesis to progressive disease. Using this model, we previously demonstrated the pro-tumorigenic role of macrophages and CD4+ T cells by showing that their depletion significantly reduced the formation of tumors and extended survival. In this study, 10X Chromium gene expression analysis of stromal cells from nascent and mature tumors identified two distinct subsets of CAFs characterized by alpha smooth muscle actin (<i>Acta2)<\/i> and Wilms tumor 1 (<i>Wt1<\/i>) expression. Interestingly, only <i>Wt1<\/i> CAFs expressed chemokines and cytokines involved in recruitment of myeloid and T cells. <i>Wt1 <\/i>CAFs were enriched in the early tumor microenvironment and expressed genes encoding ADAMTS enzymes involved in degradation of the proteoglycan versican. Our preliminary findings indicate that <i>Wt1<\/i> CAFs may be a crucial early recruiter of pro-tumorigenic immune cells in our model of neuroblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fc4710e2-266d-4d18-b472-753e78c9fd34\/@H03B8ZKY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Stroma,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11658"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicolas B.

With the aim to define new therapeutic options, researchers have investigated how interactions between CM cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME) support metastatic progression. As an important component of the TME, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have largely been reported as tumor supportive. But new evidence for the high heterogeneity of the CAF compartment, including <i>in vivo<\/i> studies from our lab, showed that certain CAF subpopulations could exhibit tumor inhibitory capabilities. Interestingly, recent reports revealed that CAFs showing high expression of Immunoglobulin Superfamily containing Leucin Rich Repeat (ISLR) could show tumor inhibitory capabilities in both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Yet, despite the invaluable clinical potential of tumor inhibitory CAFs, the CAF compartment in the TME of CMs is still largely under described. Using CM patient tissue and CM patient-derived cell lines established in our lab, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define CAF subpopulations present in the TME of CMs. We identified distinct clusters characterized by differential expression of ISLR and tumor supportive CAF marker Actin Alpha 2, Smooth Muscle (ACTA2 \/ &#945;-SMA). CAF subpopulations were thus defined as follows: ISLR<sup>high<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>low<\/sup>, ISLR<sup>low<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>high<\/sup>, ISLR<sup>low<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>low<\/sup>. Altogether, we hypothesized that ISLR<sup>high<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>low<\/sup> CAFs could act to restrain tumor progression in the TME of CMs, as opposed to potentially tumor supportive ISLR<sup>low<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>high<\/sup>CAFs.<sup> <\/sup>ISLR<sup>high<\/sup> and ISLR<sup>low <\/sup>CAFs were obtained through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) performed on one of our patient-derived CAF cell lines represented in all defined scRNA-seq clusters. ISLR<sup>high <\/sup>CAFs were validated to express lower levels of &#945;-SMA (ISLR<sup>high<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>low<\/sup> CAFs) compared to ISLR<sup>low <\/sup>cells (ISLR<sup>low<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>high <\/sup>CAFs). This mutually exclusive expression of ISLR and &#945;-SMA in different CAF subpopulations is in accordance with recent data in PDAC and CRC and could indicate common underlying mechanisms driving the phenotype of each subpopulation. Further <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments are currently underway in our lab to determine the tumor supportive capabilities of both ISLR<sup>high<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>low <\/sup>and ISLR<sup>low<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>high <\/sup>CAFs. Ultimately, we expect the current study to unravel the diverse and dynamic nature of CAFs in the TME of CMs, which is still largely unknown.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e27b3dd4-a9dc-4bae-aec2-f7acb4bafa54\/@H03B8ZKY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Brain metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11660"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thomas Simon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Buckley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bodour Salhia<\/i><\/presenter>.

This could explain the desmoplastic collagen deposition, metastasis, resistance, and lethality of these tumors that we previously reported. All 290 published cases of breast tumors composed of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were reviewed and extended survivals were solicited from authors. RNA sequencing compared 11 AML breast samples to normal breast. Histology revealed invasion of adipose tissue by AML cells, many of which resided at the adipocyte periphery, accompanied by a shrinkage of adipocytes and the accumulation of collagen and elongated fibroblastic-like cells. Both lymphocytes and macrophages accompanied the infiltration. RNA sequencing showed deregulation of numerous adipose genes, including adiponectin, leptin, FABP4, COL6A3, CD36, and PPAR&#947;, as reported in co-culture studies of breast and other solid cancer cells with adipocytes. Analysis of 210 clinical cases with available followup data revealed a survival benefit of tumor excision and\/or irradiation in combination with systemic leukemic agents compared to systemic treatment alone. Two-year survival was achieved with excision +\/- RT + systemic agents in 35\/88 (40%), with RT + systemic agents in 12\/38 (32%) and in 12\/84 (14%) given systemic treatment alone. Five-year survival was achieved in 19%, 11%, and 2%, respectively. Eleven patients given surgery +\/- RT with systemic treatments survived 10+ to 19+ years. This study reveals for the first time that removal\/ablation of leukemic tumors and microenvironment can result in prolonged survival and potentially cure. Agents designed to treat marrow leukemia are ineffective in eradicating cells that have adopted solid tumor phenotype. The observed histologic features and clinical behavior of leukemic breast tumors could result from leukemic cell crosstalk with adipocytes, as reported in solid breast and other cancers. Invasion of fat is correlated with poor prognosis in many cancers. It is very likely that our findings also apply to hematologic tumors in other organs, as most contain or are near adipose tissue. Treating to cure extramedullary leukemia using combined excision\/RT and systemic therapy requires confirming that the tumor is isolated and no occult tumors are present. This was not documented in most published cases. Only 10% of reported patients had PET\/CT scans, so greater success is expected when body scans are routinely used in staging leukemia, as has been routine in every other cancer for decades. Until pharmacologic agents to interrupt malignant cell-adipocyte crosstalk are available, direct treatment of hematologic tumor after total body scan should be a new standard of care. <b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc491636-c42a-4baa-9928-624bb2fd9309\/@H03B8ZKY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Adipocytes,Breast,extramedullary,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11665"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isabel Cunningham<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James E.

Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the primary cellular component of the pancreatic tumor stroma, play a key role in the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). A better understanding of the disease biology and cellular pathways that could be targeted for treatment of PDAC are needed.<br \/>To investigate mechanisms driving immune suppression and pathways that might be targetable for treatment in PDAC, we used models where cross-talk between stromal and tumor cells could be evaluated. Three PDAC tumor cell lines were co-cultured (CC) with primary CAFs from multiple donors for 3 days, and secretion of numerous immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL6, IL8, IL10, CXCL12, was found to be upregulated in CC vs single culture (SC). IL6 and IL8 were shown to increase 2-38-fold in CC vs SC CAFs, and 1.5-20,000-fold vs SC PANCs, dependent upon cell line. By whole genome array, an upregulation of genes involved in NFkB, IL6, IL8, and AKT signaling was also observed (-log(p-value)&#62;4) in CAF cells following CC.<br \/>Multiple pathways have been implicated in regulating the immunosuppressive PDAC TME, including: CD73, a critical mediator of adenosine formation which is known to alter immune activity; and IL1, which is secreted by PDAC tumor cells, known to increase inflammation in the TME, and promote PDAC progression. The effects of CD73 inhibition and IL1R inhibition were evaluated to better characterize the downstream effects of these pathways on regulating tumor immunosuppression. Inhibition of CD73 in the CC reduced production of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL6, IL8, MCP1 CXCL12, IL1a, IL1b, IL10 (16-59%). Preliminary genomic studies indicated that inhibition of CD73 decreased genes involved in invasion, migration, metastasis, EMT and angiogenesis, as well as increasing genes involved in type 1 IFN activation, including OAS1, DDX60, IFIT1 and IRF7 (FC 1.5-2). Similarly, blockade of IL1R (which is highly expressed on PDAC CAFs and is the receptor for both IL1a and IL1b) reduced immune suppressive cytokine production from PDAC tumor conditioned media-stimulated CAFs, e.g. lowering secretion of IL6 and IL8 (4-20-fold) in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking IL1R in a PDAC dissociated tumor cell (DTC) model resulted in decreased secretion of CXCL1 and IL6 (60-75% over 3-6 days in culture), and an upregulation of IFNg (2-10-fold) in this culture by d3.<br \/>These results suggest that a blockade of regulatory signaling pathways may be useful to reduce immune suppression and return the PDAC TME to a phenotype more amenable to immune checkpoint inhibition. Further characterization of these pathways may lead to new therapeutic combination approaches for pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0c79cdc1-e45d-4eba-a7a6-73b24fbf8767\/@J03B8ZKZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11666"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lydia Greenlees<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bilal Omar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yelena Lazdun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jixin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fernanda Pilataxi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Kuziora<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary Cooper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Vence<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie Streicher<\/i><\/presenter>.

Two major subtypes of CAFs have been previously identified by literature: myofibroblastic (myCAF) and inflammatory (iCAF). Our lab has identified subtype markers for each CAF phenotype and previously analyzed a sampling of 153 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Here, we validate these subtype markers and investigate CAF phenotypes in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Dual immunofluorescence on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections was performed to analyze co-staining between combinations of myCAF markers, &#945;SMA and TAGLN, and iCAF markers, PDPN and ICAM1. Slides were imaged using a fluorescent microscope. Also, tissue microarrays sampling 212 CRC patients spanning all stages of disease, 90 with matched metastatic cores, were stained via immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the CAF subtype markers then quantified on an intensity scale from 0-3+. iCAF and myCAF marker scores were averaged to get a composite score for each, then split into low (average score &#60;2) and high (average score &#8805;2) groups. CD8 IHC stains were quantified as the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) per high power field (HPF) in the epithelial compartment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Significant co-staining was observed between iCAF markers PDPN and ICAM1, as well as myCAF markers &#945;SMA and TAGLN. Co-staining did not occur, or was minimal, between combinations of myCAF and iCAF markers. There is not significant different in abundance of iCAFs or myCAFs in primary site cores of patients with metastatic versus non-metastatic disease (p = 0.67 for iCAF, p = 0.57 for myCAF). Of matched primary and metastatic samples able to be scored, 43.3% of samples had a decrease in iCAF score from primary to metastatic site while only 18.8% increased. Overall, 34.4% of samples had a decrease in score of more than 1 and only 2.2% of samples had an increase of more than 1. However, the percentage of samples that had a decrease in myCAF score was 32.2% while 22.2% increased. In all primary cores of patients with metastatic disease, there was higher average CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs in those with high iCAF scores compared to those with low iCAF scores (12.0 vs 5.5, p=0.03). There was not a significant difference in average CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs in those with high myCAF scores compared to those with low myCAF scores (9.3 vs 7.1, p=0.7).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Here, we validate the myCAF markers TAGLN and &#945;SMA, as well as, iCAF markers ICAM1 and PDPN by demonstrating co-staining between CAFs of the same subtype and exclusion between different subtypes. These data indicate that that CAF phenotype correlates with CD8 T cell infiltration into the TME. iCAFs correlate with immune infiltration and myCAFs with immune exclusion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/46c76269-9f74-45e1-bf05-4a5acfb0b0b0\/@J03B8ZKZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Metastatic tumors,T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11668"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna L.

In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a clinically aggressive subtype of breast cancer, increased BMI is associated with more aggressive tumor types and a higher risk of recurrence. The differences in outcomes between obese and non-obese breast cancer patients is a consequence of the complex interplay between social, environmental, and physiological factors that contribute to the etiology of breast cancer. Therefore, understanding the complex signaling events in the obese tumor microenvironment is essential. Adipose stem cells (ASCs) are a component of the breast microenvironment, and are a subset of mesenchymal stem cells. ASCs from obese patients (obASCs) secrete higher levels various cytokines and adipokines that induce a more invasive phenotype in triple negative breast cancer cells compared to ASCs from lean individuals. Leptin, an adipokine that is expressed proportionally to fat mass, has been implicated in many cancers. Increased leptin and leptin receptor expression is associated with worse prognosis. This study seeks to examine the role of leptin signaling in triple negative breast cancer.<br \/>Previous work in conjunction with a collaborating lab has shown that leptin signaling promotes metastasis and increased expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in triple negative breast cancer. This project expands upon this work through using both patient-derived cell lines and and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and examines the role of leptin signaling both in vitro and in vivo. To determine the effects of obesity upon a PDX model, a high fat diet was used to induce obesity in vivo. Exposure to conditioned media harvested from obASCs increased the percentage of TNBC cells that expressed cancer stem cell markers, whereas exposure to a small peptide antagonist of the leptin receptor decreased the percentage of cells with CSC markers. PDX tumors implanted into diet-induced obesity mice had an increased volume compared to tumors implanted into lean controls. Conclusions: These molecular differences may contribute to the differences in cancer outcomes between obese and lean individuals with breast cancer, and further study of the crosstalk between obASCs and TNBC is critical.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f449fbb0-7ccf-4194-a6d7-7edb9af48bf2\/@J03B8ZKZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Obesity,Leptin,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11673"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Courtney Brock<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maryl Wright<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khoa Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Hebert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madlin Alzoubi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bridgette Collins-Burow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Burow<\/i><\/presenter>.
