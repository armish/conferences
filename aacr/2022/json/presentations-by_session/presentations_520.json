[{"Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b> The population aged over 65 years is growing fast. The incidence of most cancers increases with age, and the cancer burden is projected to increase in the future. Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide in patients over 65 years. The proportion of rectal cancer has been increasing. Therefore, we specifically characterized the older rectal cancer patients to provide an insight into cancer care for this population.<br \/><b>Method<\/b> A total of 428 and 26,765 patients diagnosed with non-metastatic rectal cancer after 50 years old from a referral tertiary care center (SYSU cohort) and Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (SEER cohort) were included in the current study. Patients were categorized by age into intermediate-aged adults (aged 50-65 years, n=223) and older adults (aged&#8805;65 years, n=205). The demographic and clinicopathological features, molecular profiles, treatment strategies, and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. The inverse probability weighting method was used to perform risk factors-adjusted survival analysis.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>In the SYSU cohort, the difference between the two age groups was not significant in the clinicopathological features that were reported to be prognostic factors in previous studies, including tumor-node stage, poor differentiation, lymphovascular and perineural invasion and mucinous tumor. In the subset with molecular profiles, the distribution of CpG island methylator phenotype, mutations of <i>KRAS<\/i> and <i>BRAF<\/i>, and CD3+ and CD8+ tumor-Infiltrating lymphocyte counts were similar between two age groups. Of note, the older patients had higher prevalence of microsatellite instability (34.3% vs 22.2%, P=0.344). In the whole cohort, the older age was significantly associated with less cancer treatment, including neoadjuvant (6.8% vs 15.2%, P=0.009) and adjuvant (32.7% vs 57.8%, P&#60;0.001) treatment. In addition, significantly lower BMI (median: 21.92 vs 22.92 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, P=0.004), lower baseline albumin (median: 39.75 vs 41.20 g\/L, P=0.003), and higher incidence of high blood pressure (29.3% vs 12.1%, P&#60;0.001) were found in the older patients. Finally, the older patients had significantly worse overall survival outcome (adjusted hazard ratio 2.17 [95% Cl 1.44-3.27, P&#60;0.001]), and this finding was validated in the SEER cohort (adjusted hazard ratio 1.65 [95%Cl 1.58-1.72, P&#60;0.001]).<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>Older patients present with more comorbidities and worse nutritional status, and they are less likely to receive cancer therapies. Although older patients had the similar clinicopathological profiles compared with intermediate-aged patients, they had unfavorable survival outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm the extent to which our findings reflect the insufficient cancer care for older patients and improve the clinical outcomes of this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc9787c4-63da-4263-80e2-8029e71871cd\/@p03B8ZQj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL03-01 Aging, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Cancer therapy,Comorbidity,Elderly,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17501"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zhuoyang Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianru Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinxin Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunlun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meijin Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanxin Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Huichuan Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Immunotherapies with programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor or combination of PD-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve the clinical benefit for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer as second- or late-line treatment<sup>[1,2]<\/sup>. Their role in first-line treatment is under assessment. AK104 is a bispecific antibody (BsAb) that binds to both PD-1 and CTLA-4. This phase III trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK104 plus standard chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab as first-line treatment for recurrent\/metastatic cervical cancer.<br \/>Trial Design: This phase III trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. Eligible patients are aged &#8805; 18 and&#8804;75 years, diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, not amenable to curative surgery or concurrent chemoradiotherapy, ECOG PS 0-1, and life expectancy &#8805;3 months. Patients will be excluded if they have prior systemic therapy for persistent, recurrent or metastatic disease, or have previously used anti-angiogenic therapy or immune therapy. Approximately 440 patients will be randomized (1:1) to AK104 + cisplatin\/carboplatin+ paclitaxel&#177; bevacizumab or placebo + cisplatin\/carboplatin + paclitaxel &#177; bevacizumab. The treatment will be given every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy of AK104\/placebo&#177; bevacizumab until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, loss of clinical benefit as judged by the Investigator, withdrawal of consent, or completion of 2 years treatment of AK104\/placebo. The primary endpoints are blinded independent central review (BICR)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Second endpoints include Investigator-assessed PFS, BICR and Investigator-assessed Objective response rate (ORR), Disease control rate (DCR), Duration of response (DoR) and Time to response (TTR), and safety and tolerability for the treatment regime.
