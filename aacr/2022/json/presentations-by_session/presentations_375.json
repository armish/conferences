[{"Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b>: Human Papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is the most common etiologic agent of HPV-associated cancers. Treatment options are limited for patients with HPV16+ recurrent or metastatic cancers. HPV16 E7 and E6 oncogenes constitute attractive immunotherapeutic targets. HB-201 and HB-202 are live-attenuated replicating vectors based on LCMV and PICV arenaviruses, respectively, that express the same non-oncogenic HPV16 E7E6 fusion protein for induction of tumor specific T cell responses.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: A Phase I\/II open labelled clinical trial of HB-201 single vector therapy and HB-202\/HB-201 alternating two-vector therapy in patients with treatment-refractory HPV16+ cancers is currently ongoing (NCT04180215). To assess circulating E6\/E7 specific T cell responses, IFN-&#947; enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) and intracellular cytokine staining were performed on pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Evaluation of T cell infiltration and PD-L1 status in tumor bed was performed on paired tissue biopsies from a subset of patients by multiplex immunofluorescence.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Single vector therapy (HB-201) and alternating two-vector therapy (HB-202\/HB-201) rapidly induce high E6\/E7 specific T cell levels, reaching up to ~40% of the circulating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell pool. Alternating two-vector therapy seems to maintain E6\/E7 specific T cell responses better in continuous dosing compared to single vector therapy. Furthermore, we demonstrate tumor tissue T cell infiltration in more than 50% of patient samples analyzed. Currently, in depth sequencing of paired biopsies is underway to characterize the tumor microenvironment in response to HB-201 and HB-202\/HB-201 treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In this updated dataset, we show that HB-201 and HB-202\/HB-201, rapidly induce unprecedented E6\/E7 specific T cell levels in circulation following a single dose. Furthermore, these data are seen in conjunction with a pronounced increase of post-treatment CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells in tumor, suggesting E6\/E7 specific T cell infiltration. Our arenavirus vectors expressing the E7E6 fusion antigen demonstrate an attractive and safe therapy for patients with treatment refractory HPV16+ cancers. The ability of replicating arenavirus vectors to incorporate a broad range of antigens and the potent T cell inducing capacity provide a strong rationale to apply this novel therapy to other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ead28450-babe-4866-ae2f-85991893e241\/@A03B8ZFv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytotoxic T cell,Immune response,Immunotherapy,Tumor antigen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14060"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Donna Edwards<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Schwendinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kia Katchar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katia Schlienger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Klaus Orlinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Matushansky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henning Lauterbach<\/i><\/presenter>.

Its overexpression and aberrant activation characterize many cancers (including breast, lung, ovarian, liver and colon cancer). Metastasis and drug resistance are two main causes of patient mortality. Activation of the JAK-STAT3 and the FGFR1-STAT3 pathways in breast and ovarian cancer cells promotes tumor initiation, migration, and taxol resistance. STAT3 also contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer cells. Its role in numerous malignancies has made STAT3 an ideal cancer therapeutic target. BP1003 is a neutral DOPC liposome incorporated with a nuclease-resistant P-ethoxy antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting STAT3 mRNA. Here we determine the effects of BP1003 in combination with taxol and 5-FU on breast and ovarian cancer cells.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Western blots determined the extent by which BP1003 reduced STAT3 protein levels. The effect of sequential taxol or 5-FU (5 h pre-treatment) and BP1003 treatments (96 h) on cell viability was analyzed with resazurin-based&nbsp;assays. Migration and colony formation assays were performed to assess the metastatic potential of treated cells. Cells pre-treated with BP1003 (96 h) and taxol (2 h) were placed in chemotaxis chambers and allowed to migrate for 5-18 h before quantification. Colony formation involved the treatment of a low number of cells with chemotherapeutic drugs for 24 h prior to the addition of BP1003 for 10-14 days. Tumor spheroids were used to mimic in vivo solid tumor growth. Three days after formation, spheroids were treated with chemotherapeutic drugs for 1 day before being treated with BP1003 for 3 additional days.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Treatment of BT549, SK-Br-3 and SK-Ov-3 cells with 250 &#956;g\/ml of BP1003 resulted in a 30%-50% decrease in STAT3 expression. Cell viability decreased by 20-35% with 200 &#956;g\/ml of BP1003 and by 45-60% in combination with taxol or 5-FU. BP1003 in combination with taxol also decreased the colony formation potential of BT549 cells by 20%. Migration of BT549 cells was reduced by 30% with 200 &#956;g\/ml BP1003 alone and by 50% in combination with taxol. The area of BT549 and SK-Ov-3 spheroids under BP1003 and taxol combination treatments was 40%-50% smaller than control spheroids and 20%-30% smaller than taxol mono-treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>BP1003 efficiently reduces STAT3 expression and enhances the sensitivity of breast and ovarian cancer cells to taxol and 5-FU. These results are in line with previous work in which BP1003 + gemcitabine displayed enhanced anti-tumor activity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Together these results strongly suggest that BP1003 combination therapy is a novel strategy for patients with advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7fdae1a4-179e-4e97-a5cf-3b6a19126cf5\/@A03B8ZFv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-01 Antisense molecules,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"STAT3,Antisense oligonucleotides,Taxol,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14061"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Gagliardi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Tari Ashizawa<\/i><\/presenter>.

The natural 4-1BBL is a trimeric transmembrane protein that has no activity in soluble form. To overcome this limitation, a unique soluble form of 4-1BBL was developed by linking core streptavidin (SA) to the extracellular domain of murine 4-1BBL (SA-4-1BBL). This chimeric protein forms oligomers, and in soluble form, has pleiotropic effects on cells of innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity. However, production and purification of SA-4-1BBL is cost- and time-intensive. Therefore, development of an expression platform that is more efficient, translational, and augments anti-tumor efficacy of SA-4-1BBL will have a significant impact for clinical development of this immune adjuvant. Thus, we developed a novel prototype oncolytic adenoviral system to deliver SA-4-1BBL (OAdSA-4-1BBL) to the solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The AdenoQuick 2.0 system was used to construct two OAds, one expressing SA-4-1BBL and the other expressing SA (as control virus). The expression of transgenes was confirmed by western blot and the SA-4-1BBL biological function was evaluated by splenocyte proliferation assay <i>in vitro<\/i>. The OAdSA-4-1BBL and OAdSA-mediated cancer killing effect was evaluated by crystal violet staining, the activation of autophagy-mediate immunogenic cell death was assessed by detection of autophagy markers (e.g., LC3-I and II as well as p62), the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), and calreticulin were evaluated by luminescence, ELISA, and flow cytometry, respectively. Expression of SA, SA-4-1BBL, and Hexon within the tumors were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The OAdSA-4-1BBL therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a C57BL\/6 mice bearing subcutaneous TC-1 lung tumor.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We successfully constructed two OAds expressing SA or SA-4-1BBL, we demonstrated that SA-4-1BBL can produce biologically active oligomers, selectively induces autophagy-mediated immunogenic cell death in murine and human lung cancer cell lines with little cytotoxicity in normal cell lines. The transgene expressions within the subcutaneous tumor were confirmed and OAdSA-4-1BBL shows greater anti-tumor efficacy than control viruses in a TC-1 tumor mouse model.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Overall, our data suggests that OAd expressing the immune checkpoint stimulator SA-4-1BBL may represent alternative therapeutic strategy against lung cancer, which could be used alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, or other approaches aimed at enhancing the anti-tumor immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63be2790-5212-418f-acdc-eeb8785f452b\/@A03B8ZFv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-03 Immune modulators,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunostimulation,Adenovirus,Oncolytic,Gene therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14062"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"3cea99a4-d49b-4c47-9027-0f21cd8be221","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3cea99a4-d49b-4c47-9027-0f21cd8be221\/@A03B8ZFv\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jorge G.

Metastatic dissemination of primary tumors involves the repeated crossing of tissues barriers, which requires dynamic modulation of tumor cell adhesion, presumably through mechanisms like those utilized by trafficking leukocytes. Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM\/CD166) has been shown to play an important role in the metastatic process, including detachment from the primary tumor, adhesion to endothelium, and extravasation. ALCAM expression correlates with melanoma progression, and it has been identified as a marker of pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, its expression in primary melanoma strongly correlates with tumor thickness and level of invasiveness. shRNA silencing of ALCAM in cells with high levels of ALCAM resulted in reduced motility and transmigration. In the current study, we tested the effect of CRISPR-mediated ALCAM knockout (KO) on migration and invasion of two human melanoma cell lines representing opposite phenotypic states of melanoma. MEL501 (proliferative type, SOX10\/MITF-high and AP1\/TEAD1-low) cells express low levels of ALCAM at baseline, while the Rosi cell line (invasive type, SOX10\/MITF-low and AP1\/TEAD1-high) expresses high baseline ALCAM levels. ALCAM KO promoted migration of MEL501 cells (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.000001) but inhibited migration of Rosi cells (<i>p<\/i>=0.005050) as compared to the parent cell lines. In addition, ALCAM KO promoted the invasion of MEL501 cells (<i>p<\/i>=0.019768) but had no impact on Rosi cell invasion. While ALCAM has been shown to regulate matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activation, zymograms revealed no difference in MMP-2 activity between MEL501 and Rosi ALCAM-KO cells and the parent cell lines. These data indicate that ALCAM may play a tumor-suppressive role in melanoma cells with low ALCAM expression and are consistent with a previous study which demonstrated that introduction of an amino-terminally truncated ALCAM in early stage melanoma cells promoted metastasis. Our data also provide <i>in vitro <\/i>evidence that gene therapy may reverse the migratory phenotype of melanoma cells with high ALCAM expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/77781e66-f150-41ae-970f-de1bac07b696\/@A03B8ZFv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Gene therapy and radiation studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Adhesion molecules,CRISPR,Phenotype,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14063"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"d8448025-29d9-42ae-ba86-9ab1a54e878a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d8448025-29d9-42ae-ba86-9ab1a54e878a\/@A03B8ZFv\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Rafal Kaminski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca P.

One of the issues is the induction of an unwanted immune response that can have an influence on the efficacy and potency of the treatment. Additionally, pre-existing immunity towards AAV and CRISPR can also neutralize the therapeutic effect. Comprehensive assessment of human immune responses to gene therapy candidates includes characterization of humoral and cellular immunogenicity specific for both the viral vector and the expressed transgene (protein) product before and after dose administration. In vitro assays such as dendritic cell activation and T cell proliferation assays can be used to assess this unwanted immunogenicity in an early phase. Additionally, innate assays such as dendritic cell activation assays can be used for the evaluation of potential impurities and innate response inducing contaminants. Sensitive Fluorospot assays can be used to monitor patient&#8217; specific immunogenicity both at the T and B cell level. The advantage of the Fluorospot technology is the sensitivity to detect responses on a single cell level and measure up to 4 analytes simultaneously.

These ICIs inhibit PD-1 ligand binding, removing interference with T cell function, allowing T cell proliferation, and restoring the anti-tumor activity. Potential factors predicting checkpoint blockade success include PD-L1 expression, the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, microsatellite instability, and tumor mutational burden. ICIs are most effective clinically in combination therapies. Here, we devised a simple ICI gene therapy as a possible alternative to traditional and expensive monoclonal antibodies. We designed plasmids encoding the mouse sequences homologous to the nivolumab and pembrolizumab binding regions, which overlap the PD-1 ligand binding site. We hypothesized that, when produced intratumorally, each PD-1 peptide should bind PD-L1 and block T cell binding. Since B16F10 mouse melanoma cells and tumors express PD-L1, we tested this theory in this model. We directly demonstrated peptide-PD-L1 binding histologically on B16F10 mouse melanoma tumors. Systemic expression of the encoded peptides did not induce changes in general demeanor, discomfort or weight changes in mice, implying that intratumor expression would also be non-toxic. We then tested these peptide plasmids therapeutically. Intratumor electroporation delivery of the peptide plasmids to palpable B16F10 mouse melanoma tumors significantly increased tumor doubling time and induced approximately 10% long-term tumor regression. Delivery of a plasmid encoding IL-12 induced long-term tumor regression in approximately 40% of mice as well as a reduction myeloid-derived suppressor cells and T regulatory cells and an increase infiltration of CD8+ T cells, creating an inflamed tumor microenvironment. This modulation of the tumor microenvironment suggested the potentiation of a combination therapy. This combination synergistically increased long-term regression to 80-100%, depending on the peptide plasmid delivered, over either PD-1 peptide or IL-12 gene therapy alone. These results demonstrated that the delivery of immune regulators with differing activities may be a promising and potentially inexpensive alternative to monoclonal antibody therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae45c562-9c46-45af-9c42-13b667aa821e\/@A03B8ZFv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Gene therapy and radiation studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Gene therapy,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14065"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Loree Heller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guilan Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jody Synowiec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Heller<\/i><\/presenter>.

Gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) has been adopted to mitigate these issues. In this study, we demonstrated the specific targeting of myrosinase-sinigrin paired GDEPT to treat HER2<sup>+<\/sup> (human epidermal growth factor 2) cancer cells. Sinigrin excessively present in cruciferous vegetables can be catalyzed by myrosinase to produce cytotoxic ally isothiocyanate (AITC), which has shown anticancer effectiveness. The myrosinase gene was packed in biotinylated lentiviral vectors produced by co-transfection of HEK293T cells. The single chain variable fragment (scFv) gene sequence of anti-HER2 antibody and core streptavidin (coreSA) gene sequence were cloned in pET-30a(+) plasmid, which was then transformed in Lemo21 (DE3) competent cells for protein expression. The anti-HER2-coreSA chimeric protein was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The purified chimeric protein was tagged on biotinylated lentivirus via streptavidin-biotin binding. Our results showed that myrosinase-encoding lentivirus tagged with anti-HER2 selectively delivered myrosinase to HER2<sup>+<\/sup> cancer cells. When treated with prodrug sinigrin, the targeted cancer cells underwent apoptosis and ensuing cell death. In summary, the targeted delivery of myrosinase to HER2<sup>+<\/sup> cancer cells using lentivirus functionalized with anti-HER2 ScFv antibody can eradicate malignant cells when treated with enzymatically catalyzed prodrug sinigrin.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7337068e-78a2-47cf-8fd7-25876d6850ff\/@A03B8ZFv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Drug delivery,Prodrugs,Lentivirus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14067"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ammar Ahmad Tarar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ching-An Peng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Currently, various oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSVs) with enhanced tumor targeting, antitumor efficacy, and safety have been explored in many different models, and on a range of tumor targets. It has been a difficult task to completely retarget HSV to cancer-specific antigens at the plasma membrane of selected tumors, while maintaining the fully lytic potential of HSV. This approach achieved by a deep knowledge of virus natural receptor recognition, binding, and entry mechanisms. Two strategies have been employed including the incorporation of single-chain antibodies (scFv) into gD, gC or gH and the use of soluble adapter molecules that are capable of binding to both HSV and the specific receptor on the target cell. In the previous study, we first reported that HSV could retarget to gastric carcinoma cells by HVEM-CEA adapter molecule. Although we have been shown reasonable efficiency of retargeted cell transduction in vitro and in vivo, it required purification of the adapter protein and continuous addition to the virus prior to infection. To overcome the limitations of adapter molecules, we developed a self-retargeting system by incorporation of adapter expression cassette into the HSV genome that enables the sustained secretion of adapter protein while the viral replication in infected tumor cells. Furthermore, to strengthen the retargeting modality, we constructed a novel, double targeted oHSV, carries no deletion\/attenuation, consisting of self-retargeting adapter and modified gH to EpCAM. Our results show that the initial infection and subsequent viral spread depend on cellular EpCAM expression. When injected intravenously (i.v.), they caused no harm to tumor-free mice up to the maximum tested dosage (2 x 10<sup>8<\/sup> PFU). When a single intratumoral dose of double targeting oHSV (2 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> infectious units) were administered in a xenograft model they rendered 80% of mice tumor-free. Our findings suggest that the double retargeting platform of HSV carrying self-retargeting adapter and modified gH may be potent in cancer-specific cell killing and thus useful for the treatment of EpCAM expressing various cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6686894-80da-4c92-9652-b3ff6e20e7a8\/@s03B8ZFw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Ep-CAM,Double targeting,Self-targeting adapter,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14069"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hyunjung Baek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun-Yoo Joo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun-Ran Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chun-Seob Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sujung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyeri Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mihee Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bora Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Heechung Kwon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

JX-594 (Pexavec, SillaJen) is an attenuated (TKdeactivated ) oncolytic vaccinia VV, engineered to express GM-CSF and to selectively target tumor over non-tumor tissues. It is currently being investigated as a novel therapeutic option in patients with advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC, NCT03294083). The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of JX-954 in a panel of clear and non-clear cell RCC cell lines and characterize the potential mechanisms of JX-594 oncolysis in vitro. We evaluated the oncolytic potency of JX-594 in human clear cell RCCs (VHL mutant 786-0, A498, VHL wild type Caki-1), non-clear cell RCC (ACHN, papillary RCC, and UOK-262, an FH deficient papillary RCC cell) and murine renal cancer cells (RENCA). Potent and persistent cytotoxic effects were induced by JX-594 in all human RCC cells, regardless of the histological subtype, and by mJX-594 (a Western Reserve strain of vaccinia virus expressing murine GMCSF) in RENCA cells. Moreover, we observed efficient viral replication in human (786-0, ACHN) and murine (RENCA) cells, confirming RCC permissiveness to viral infection. Functional proteomics analysis of JX-594 treated 786-0 cells was performed by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) to gain knowledge on potential mechanisms of viral oncolysis. JX-594 treatment had significant effects on the expression levels of proteins related to inducing cell cycle, apoptosis, necrosis, Akt signaling, MAPK signaling, autophagy and stress induction. In particular, the proteins related to cell cycle (Wee1, Cdc25c, CHK1\/2, and Cyclin B1) and Akt signaling (PI3K, mTOR, Rictor and FOXO), MAPK signaling (JAK2, PAK1, FAK and MEK1) were down regulated, while proteins involved in apoptosis and necrosis were upregulated. In summary, our studies show that human and murine renal cancer cells are permissive to infection and replication by JX-594 and mJX-594, which induce potent oncolytic effects in clear and non-clear cell RCC, effects associated with significant modulation of RCC pathways associated with cell cycle, proliferation, and survival and stress responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b91c35e8-c8ba-4947-857c-42db90dc74fd\/@s03B8ZFw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Vaccinia virus,Gene therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14070"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuqi Jing<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>F Bustamante Guerrero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaime Merchan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Two different humanized mouse models were utilized. In a PBMC humanized mouse model, NSG MHC Class I\/II knock-out mice (DKO) were injected with 1E7 human PBMC and followed one day later with 2E7 TU of LV encoding for CD19 CAR. In parallel, CD34+ humanized NSG SGM3 mice were also administered 2E7 TU LV encoding CD19 CAR. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood samples was evaluated at various time points for the presence of CAR+ cells and CD20+ B cells. Additionally, tissue samples were examined by histopathology and PCR for vector copy numbers.<br \/>Results: The NSG SGM3 humanized CD34+ mouse model exhibited efficient chimerism of human CD45+ hematopoietic cells (&#62;50% of live cells in peripheral blood). Apart from CD15+ neutrophils, all major human immune cell components were well represented in peripheral blood including CD14+ monocytes, CD20+ B cells, and CD3+ lymphocytes. At study initiation, the T cell compartment in the SGM3 mice exhibited skewing towards CD4+ T cells. Injection of CD19 CAR-LV resulted in a significant reduction of CD20+ B cells as early as 5 days post-injection. CD3+ CAR+ cells were detected in peripheral blood by day 5 with evidence of CAR+ cell expansion at subsequent time points. Loss of CD20+ B cells was stable throughout the observation period with some mice exhibiting a complete elimination of B cells.

Due to the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), a large part of the intravenously-administered dose does not reach the therapeutic target. Our approach aims to address this issue using biocompatible nanoparticles&#8212;the Nanoprimer&#8212;that is administered prior to the therapeutic. Due to its physico-chemical properties, the Nanoprimer is transiently internalized by Kupffer cells (KC), and endothelial cells of the MPS, enabling temporary reduction of hepatic clearance. These data further explore the Nanoprimer&#8217;s mechanism of action and demonstrate that scavenger receptor-A (SR) is the main receptor involved in Nanoprimer binding and uptake by KC. Efficacy studies in mouse model show that the Nanoprimer dramatically increases the anti-tumor efficacy of nucleic acid-based treatment without introducing additional toxicities. An <i>in vitro<\/i> toxicity evaluation was performed investigating the Nanoprimer&#8217;s hemolytic properties and its potential ability to activate the complement system, platelet aggregation and pro-inflammatory cytokines*. SR-mediated binding and uptake of Nanoprimer by KC were assessed using a competitive binding assay with SR inhibitor polyinosinic acid. The impact of the Nanoprimer on anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated on orthotopic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model in combination with siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) targeting a novel cancer-specific gene transcript of a master regulator of invadopodia formation and Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch oncogenic pathways. Results showed that the Nanoprimer is safe at the effective dose. The Nanoprimer does not activate the complement components, induce hemolysis, platelet aggregation, or cytokine storm syndrome elements. The competitive inhibition of SR-A decreases Nanoprimer binding and KC-uptake by 70%, indicating SR-A selective uptake of the Nanoprimer by macrophages. The efficacy study shows that combining the Nanoprimer with siRNA LNP therapy significantly increased treatment efficiency, with a mean tumor growth inhibition ratio of 36.3% for LNPs alone versus 84.6% for the combination. Moreover, the combination therapy more efficiently prevents the development of pulmonary metastatic tumors, with a metastasis-inhibition rate of 98%. These data demonstrate the safety of the Nanoprimer, along with its ability to maximize the inhibition of primary tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis by systemic siRNA LNP therapy in a TNBC mouse model. They also highlight the capacity of Nanoprimer technology to unlock the potential of nucleic acid-based treatments. The ubiquitous nature of its mode of action allows its application to a broad spectrum of anti-cancer therapeutics. *we acknowledge NCL, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research sponsored by the NCI for the help with conducting these experiments","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dce8069b-d635-4de2-9eb7-b8a00e0e9c7e\/@s03B8ZFw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-01 Antisense molecules,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Breast cancer,siRNA,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14072"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julie Devallière<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurence Poul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxime Bergère<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Darmon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Océane Jibault<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francis Mpambani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelvin Tsai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthieu Germain<\/i><\/presenter>.

Pharmacological treatments, including immunotherapies, fail in the presence of liver metastases (LMS). Therefore, identifying new interventional tools and key targetable players involved in the immunosuppressive environment is of pivotal importance. We developed a lentiviral vector (LV)-based platform for selective genetic engineering of resident and tumour-associated macrophages enabling locally-sourced delivery of therapeutic molecules to LMS. Selective transgene expression is driven by a macrophage specific promoter and fine-tuned by microRNA target sequences. Upon systemic delivery of the LV, we observed enhanced transgene expression in macrophages located in areas surrounding LMS. We then equipped the LV with an IFN&#945;-coding sequence, a cytokine with pleiotropic immune effects. Long term analysis in mice showed LV dose-dependent, sustained and well-tolerated IFN&#945; expression. To investigate the therapeutic efficacy, we employed a colorectal cancer (CRC) organoid-based syngeneic mouse model of LMS containing molecular and histopathological hallmarks of the human disease. IFN&#945; LV treatment significantly delayed LMS growth reaching a complete response in up to 50 %. Single cell omics of LMS from IFN&#945; LV-treated mice showed upregulation of IFN&#945;-responsive genes, macrophage skewing to an antigen presenting (M1-like) polarization state, and expansion as well as reduced exhaustion of LMS-associated antigen specific CD8 T cells. Employing spatial transcriptomics, we found that the interface between LMS and liver parenchymal tissue was the major site of IFN&#945; action, which was associated with enhanced immune activation and antigen presentation. Furthermore, we observed decreased angiogenesis and hypoxia in IFN&#945; LV-treated LMS. When comparing LMS of treatment responsive to resistant mice, we found accumulation of activated CD8 T-cells in responsive whereas a high number of immunosuppressive T regulatory type 1 (TR1)-like cells in resistant mice. Molecular analyses suggest that TR1-like cell infiltration was associated with increased IL10 signaling in resistant mice. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between IFN&#945; and TR1-like cell signatures in human LMS and primary CRC thus supporting the link between IFN&#945; activation and expansion of TR1-like cells in cancer. In summary, we developed an innovative gene-based platform that upon a single well-tolerated intravenous LV infusion rapidly promotes a protective therapeutic response against LMS through enabling immune activation. However, we also found that TR1-like cells might promote tumor immune evasion in presence of IFN&#945; signaling in this setting, suggesting targeting of TR1-like cells when facing resistance to cancer immunotherapies that trigger IFN&#945; signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/54819aa7-a094-426a-a96b-452ba40c7aeb\/@s03B8ZFw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene therapy,Immunotherapy,Macrophages,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14074"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thomas Kerzel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefano Beretta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eloise Scamardella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Balestrieri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tamara Canu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Pedica<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rossana Norata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucia Sergi Sergi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Genua<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ostuni Renato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Kajaste-Rudnitski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonio Esposito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masanobu Oshima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Tonon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Sanvito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mario Leonardo Squadrito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luigi Naldini<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have generated a replicating viral vector based on the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus expressing the melanoma tissue-specific self-antigen Trp2 (artLCMV-Trp2) and show that a single immunization of mice bearing established melanoma with this vector can break tolerance against this self antigen and induces high levels of tumor-infiltrating TRP2<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. These T cells express the effector cytokines IFN&#947; and TNF&#945;, lack markers of T cell exhaustion, and their appearance coincides with marked inhibition of tumor growth and significant survival benefit. artLCMV-TRP2 induced a strong type I interferon response that resulted in transient type I-dependent Treg inhibition that was necessary for the generation of optimal antitumoral T cell responses. Moreover, artLCMV-TRP2 vaccination proved able to induce complete tumor remission when combined with infusion of exogenous TRP2-specific T cells into mice. In conclusion, replication competence is a key property of artLCMV-TRP2 that enabled effective anti-cancer immunity and therapeutic effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63064212-3c34-45e7-94dd-87a2b659a85f\/@s03B8ZFw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunostimulation,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Cytotoxic T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14076"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mette-Triin Purde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabienne Hartmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jovana Cupovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Schmidt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Bomze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felix Stemeseder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Lercher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lenka Besse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fiamma Berner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Tüting<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Bergthaler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Schietinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Kochanek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Burkhard Ludewig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Klaus K.

Clinical benefit has been demonstrated for intratumoral administration. Still, the therapeutic effectiveness of intravenous delivery has been limited by neutralizing antibody responses against the virus. To circumvent this limitation, we developed Synthetic RNA viruses, a novel approach for intravenous and repeated administration of OVs, consisting of a viral RNA genome (vRNA) formulated within lipid nanoparticles. Systemic administration of ONCR-788, the Synthetic RNA virus drug candidate encoding the vRNA of Seneca Valley virus (SVV), led to potent anti-tumor efficacy, even in the presence of OV neutralizing antibodies in the bloodstream. After a single intravenous administration of ONCR-788, we demonstrated vRNA delivery, viral replication, spread, and lysis of tumor cells. Robust anti-tumor efficacy was observed across diverse neuroendocrine tumor models, including tumor CDX and PDX xenografts, lung orthotopic, and GEMM-derived models. In a syngeneic model, ONCR-788 stimulated both tumor lysis and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced T cell recruitment and activation, increased expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and myeloid cells, and M2 to M1 macrophage conversion were observed. Combination of ONCR-788 with anti-PD-1 resulted in improved anti-tumor activity versus the monotherapy arms. Altogether, ONCR-788 provides an innovative approach that enables repeat intravenous administration of viral immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/634ec615-a214-40ea-b4bc-698c303a31c5\/@s03B8ZFw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Lung cancer,Drug delivery,Liposomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14077"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Edward M.

Oncolytic viruses (OV) preferentially replicate in and lyse tumor cells, leading to systemic immune stimulation. Studies have shown that hypersialylation promotes tumor growth and metastasis, as well as the suppression of immune cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to facilitate tumor invasion and angiogenesis and maintain immunosuppressive microenvironment in solid tumors. We are developing vvDD-Sial-FAP\/CD3, an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing a membrane-bound sialidase, to remove sialic acids from the cell surface glycans, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted T cell engager, to eliminate glycoimmune checkpoint and tumor stroma, respectively. vvDD-Sial-FAP\/CD3 is an engineered vaccinia virus of Western Reserve (WR) strain with: (1) an insertional disruption of the viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene with the sialidase and FAP\/CD3 transgenes. TK is an essential enzyme for the pyrimidine synthesis pathway; viral TK gene deletion thus results in selective replication of virus in rapidly dividing cancerous cells with high intracellular nucleotide pools, and (2) a deletion of the vaccinia growth factor (VGF) genes for greater dependence on the cell cycling status of the cancer cells. Our results showed that sialidase expressed from vvDD-Sial-FAP\/CD3 efficiently cleaves the sialic acids from the cell surface and the Fc fused to the sialidase induced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) using an ADCC reporter assay. <i>In vitro<\/i> efficacy studies were conducted using HCT-116 human colon cancer cells mixed with FAP-expressing normal human dermal fibroblasts or FAP-positive HCC1143 human breast cancer cells in the presence of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In both tumor models, vvDD-Sial-FAP\/CD3 induced activation of both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, as measured by the upregulation of CD69 and CD25 markers and increased granzyme B release, which resulted in enhanced cell killing. Using A549 co-cultured with CAFs microtissues, we showed that vvDD-Sial-FAP\/CD3 spread efficiently within the tumor spheroids. In addition, vvDD-Sial-FAP\/CD3 increased tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes, leading to enhanced cell killing. Taken together, our results have demonstrated potent anti-tumor and -stroma effects induced by vvDD-Sial-FAP\/CD3 in multiple cancer models. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy of vvDD-Sial-FAP\/CD3, either alone or in combination with checkpoint inhibitor or NK cell therapy, is being evaluated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7a445647-6b75-4186-833a-e8cf764e81e6\/@s03B8ZFw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-03 Immune modulators,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Immune checkpoint,Stroma,Fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14078"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Winnie M.
