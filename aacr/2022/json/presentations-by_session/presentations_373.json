[{"Abstract":"SRF388 is a first-in-class, anti-IL-27 antibody developed to enhance immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that IL-27 pathway blockade can inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of liver cancer and lung cancer metastases. There is also evidence that IL-27 pathway inhibition is accompanied by activation of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. An ongoing Phase I trial has shown good tolerability at all dose levels tested and preliminary monotherapy antitumor activity with SRF388 (NCT04374877). Here, we describe the preclinical and clinical data used to select a RP2D and characterize cytokine and chemokine changes observed in patients after treatment with SRF388. To guide selection of the RP2D, the relationship between maximal effective dose (MaxED), pharmacokinetics (PK), and whole blood inhibition of IL-27-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 by SRF388 was evaluated in a mouse model of liver cancer. The concentration of SRF388 associated with optimal antitumor activity was ~20-fold above the concentration needed for complete inhibition (&#62; 90%) of whole blood phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1). These PK and activity relationships were also defined in patients during the dose-escalation phase of the trial and integrated with safety and efficacy data to select a monotherapy RP2D. In patients, PK were linear, no dose-limiting toxicities were reported, complete pSTAT1 inhibition was achieved throughout the first cycle at 0.3 mg\/kg, and 1 patient experienced a confirmed partial response per RECIST version 1.1 at a dose of 10 mg\/kg. In the MaxED mouse model, the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) associated with significant antitumor activity was 1720 day*&#956;g\/mL. In patients, the corresponding target AUC was achieved clinically at 10 mg\/kg after a single dose of SRF388. Changes in the concentration of several serum cytokines and chemokines were observed after SRF388 treatment including an increase in IL-27, a phenomenon described for other anti-cytokine antibodies due to altered clearance of the cytokine-antibody complex. Changes in a subset of other serum cytokines\/chemokines correlated with a reduction in target lesion size. Taken together, these data support the selection of a monotherapy RP2D of 10 mg\/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for SRF388. These data highlight how complementary strategies utilizing preclinical and clinical biomarker evaluations can be employed to establish a monotherapy RP2D and assess biological activity of a first-in-class anti-cytokine antibody, SRF388, for patients with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/359ddf8b-c1ae-4859-a734-471d970e4b03\/@s03B8ZFn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Pharmacodynamics,Immuno-oncology,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13830"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jonathan A.

Assessment of the persistence and biodistribution of these product candidates requires specific and sensitive methods to detect engineered cells in both liquid and solid biopsies. Here, we present the development and validation of two complimentary nucleic acid-based detection assays for iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cell product candidates containing Fate&#8217;s proprietary high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 transgene (hnCD16). The first assay is a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method to detect and quantify hnCD16 transgene copies present in a pool of genomic DNA (gDNA). The primers and probe were designed to recognize the optimized codons of hnCD16. Assay linearity and accuracy were assessed through titration studies using 0.024 to 1 ng of hnCD16-containing DNA spiked into different amounts of hnCD16-negative gDNA. Precision was determined through multiple assay runs by different operators on two instruments. The second assay is an <i>in situ <\/i>hybridization based method utilizing RNAscope<sup>TM<\/sup> technology to detect cells expressing hnCD16 in fixed tissue. Probes targeting hnCD16 were used to optimize signal specificity. Cells expressing hnCD16 and tissues from in vivo studies treated with iNK products served as positive controls. For the ddPCR assay, absolute limit of detection (aLoD) was determined to be 4.9 copies of hnCD16 per 20 &#181;L reaction, regardless of total genomic mass input. Absolute limit of quantification (aLoQ) was 12 copies per 20 &#181;L reaction with a %CV &#8804;30. Relative limit of quantification (rLoQ), assessing transgene to total DNA ratio, is affected by the background gDNA input and is less sensitive with lower input mass. rLoQ for total mass of 70 - 250 ng was 97 - 22 copies\/&#181;g gDNA (0.064% - 0.015%) with a %CV &#8804;30. The sensitivity of this input range allows evaluation of clinical samples with low cellularity. While ddPCR provides robust quantification of the hnCD16 transcript, the RNAscope<sup>TM<\/sup> assay informs localization of the iNK product. Specificity of the probe was established by confirming its lack of affinity for endogenous CD16 using a variety of human normal and tumor tissues and by staining hnCD16-positive fixed cell pellets and tissues from <i>in vivo<\/i> studies. In cell pellets, positive RNAscope<sup>TM<\/sup> signal correlated with the known ratio of transgene positive cells. In murine tissues previously confirmed to contain iNK cell product, the RNAscope<sup>TM<\/sup> positive staining correlated with NKG2A immunohistochemistry staining, confirming the presence of product NK cells. The combined use of both the ddPCR and RNAscope<sup>TM<\/sup> assays targeted to hnCD16 allows for detection and quantification of transgene-bearing iNK cells in a wide variety of patient samples including tumor biopsies. Both assays are being utilized for cell detection and quantification in our ongoing clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/15ae40aa-51d5-4a79-bf2a-1759e7ad00e5\/@t03B8ZFo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Pharmacokinetics,Adoptive cell therapy,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13839"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c1df131a-6af4-4c94-8d54-5a00e5b3ad6c","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c1df131a-6af4-4c94-8d54-5a00e5b3ad6c\/@t03B8ZFo\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cara E.

Therefore, new approaches need to treat them. One approach would be to combine with immunotherapy. 4-1BB (CD137) is a key costimulatory receptor expressed on activated T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells and a promising therapeutic target in cancer. In this study, we present the results from a preclinical study on the efficacy and safety of HER2\/4-1BB bispecific antibody, YH32367 (ABL105). YH32367 has been designed to overcome the challenges with HER2 resistance via tumor-directed 4-1BB agonism. Its activity was determined using cell-based 4-1BB bioassay and co-culture assay with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC). <i>In vivo <\/i>anti-tumor efficacy of YH32367 was assessed in both HER2-expressing tumor-bearing hPBMC humanized mice and h4-1BB knock-in mice. In addition, 4-week repeated dose toxicity study of YH32367 was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys at the dose of 10, 30 and 100 mg\/kg. YH32367 stimulated IFN-&#947; secretion and thereby eliciting tumor cell lysis in co-culture assay with hPBMC and HER2-expressing tumor cells. YH32367 also showed a long-term tumor immunity as well as superior efficacy on tumor eradication in MC38\/hHER2-bearing h4-1BB knock-in mouse models, compared to the equimolar dosing of trastuzumab and benchmark 4-1BB agonistic antibody. Even a single dosing of YH32367 at the doses of 1, 3 and 10 mg\/kg elicited complete tumor regression in more than 80% of mice bearing MC38\/hHER2<i>. <\/i>In GLP 4-week toxicity study in monkeys, there were no YH32367-related effects on mortality, body weight, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, microscopic observations, cardiovascular system and immunotyping\/cytokine analysis in any doses, indicating a favorable safety profile. In conclusion, YH32367 exhibited potent <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> vivo<\/i> effects via tumor immunity and it was well tolerated and safe in the 4-week toxicity study. These results suggest that YH32367 could be a promising therapeutic for HER2-positive cancer patients, especially with HER2 drug resistance as an effective HER2-targeted therapy.

Preclinically, EV has demonstrated tumor cell-killing by direct cytotoxicity, bystander toxicity, and induction of the hallmarks of immunogenic cell death. In EV-301, a phase 3 clinical study, EV monotherapy showed an overall survival (OS) benefit vs chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la\/mUC) who had previously received platinum-based therapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor (Powles 2021). EV also has encouraging activity in combination with pembrolizumab in previously untreated la\/mUC (73% ORR)(Friedlander 2021). Most newly diagnosed bladder cancer cases are non-muscle invasive (Chang 2016; Woldu 2017; Kates 2020; Li 2020). Standard treatment of high risk NMIBC involves transurethral resection of the bladder tumor followed by intravesical (IVES) Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or chemotherapy. Although response to BCG is high, many patients recur within 1-5 years (Matulay 2021). For patients unresponsive to BCG, treatment options are limited; radical cystectomy remains the standard of care. Due to the morbidity associated with radical cystectomy there remains a significant unmet need for a safe and effective therapy. We demonstrate that NMIBC have a high Nectin-4 expression pattern by RNA analyses and immunohistochemistry (IHC) similar to la\/mUC, using an anti-Nectin-4 antibody (clone M22-321b41.1). The anti-tumor activity of EV was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in human bladder cancer cells overexpressing Nectin-4. The superiority of EV vs MMAE alone was shown via <i>in vitro<\/i> pulsed (2hr) exposure cytotoxicity assays mimicking IVES administration. In a luciferase expressing orthotopic xenograft mouse model of NMIBC, EV-mediated anti-tumor activity was confirmed by both bioluminescence imaging of tumor burden and IHC for h-Nectin-4 expressing cancer cells. Tumor uptake of EV was further confirmed by IHC detection of EV in the engrafted tumor cells. Repeat-dose IVES administration of EV was well tolerated in a GLP study with minimal local and no systemic toxicities at doses up to 6-fold the intravenous maximum tolerated dose. Consistent with the lack of systemic toxicities, IVES administration was associated with low systemic absorption (&#60;1% of the dose-normalized ADC C<sub>max<\/sub> observed in intravenous toxicity studies) and undetectable systemic MMAE. In this preclinical model, increased levels of MMAE in the targeted bladder tissue were associated with increasing the total dose and concentration of EV more than changing either the volume instilled or dwell time. These findings provide evidence to support further investigation of intravesical EV in NMIBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3953b0d0-35e2-4c7e-97f7-72803cd3e05a\/@t03B8ZFo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Nectin-4,vedotin,Intravesical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13832"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher Carosino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Devra Olson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie Snead<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Farr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amit Garg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine O'Day<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Esther Trueblood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Wright<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Bieda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Caldwell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Hensley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean Allred<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernard Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masashi Shimazaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharsti Sandall<\/i><\/presenter>.

We measured tumor volume in addition to total ADC, total antibody, and free payload in the plasma and assessed biomarkers related to DNA damage in the tumor by western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In HER2+ NCI-N87 tumor-bearing mice, T-DXd plasma AUC was 342.6ug\/ml*day and T<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>was 3.5 days, while in the HER2-low Capan-1 tumor-bearing mice, T-DXd plasma AUC was 297.2ug\/ml*day and T<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>was 1.4 days. Plasma exposures of free payload (DXd) were less than 1 ng\/mL. Both models responded to T-DXd, demonstrating regression over the 14 day study (T\/C =-6.08%, NCI-N87 and -96.1%, Capan-1). In NCI-N87, we observed rapid and sustained increases in gamma H2AX (gH2AX), with a 3.5-fold increase in % positive staining by IHC (H-score p&#60;0.001) with gH2AX foci as early as 24h post treatment, and sustained out to 96h.

Further, we observed significant increases in pRAD50 at 24h (3.6-fold increase by IHC, H-score p&#60;0.001) which was sustained out to 96h. In Capan-1, we observed more diffuse staining of gH2AX and non-significant 1.4-fold increase in gH2AX at 24h. pRAD50 increases were delayed in the Capan-1 model with a 2.8-fold increase observed at 48h and sustained out to 168h post treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Plasma exposure of T-DXd in NCI-N87 tumor bearing mice was prolonged compared to Capan-1, possibly due to mouse strain differences. The increased systemic exposure resulted in more rapid and sustained DNA damage as measured by gH2AX and pRAD50 in the NCI-N87 tumor compared to Capan-1.

Clinically, T-DXd has demonstrated antitumor activity in both HER2+ and HER2-low cancers. Due to the role of PARP1 in resolution of DNA damage induced by topoisomerase I trapping, we tested the combination of the next generation PARP1-selective inhibitor AZD5305 with T-DXd.<br \/>Methods: We evaluated the antiproliferative ability of the combination of T-DXd with AZD5305 in a panel of 27 breast cancer cell lines in an <i>in vitro<\/i> 7-day viability assay. The combination was also evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i> in two non-HRD HER2+ models, KPL4 (Breast) and NCI-N87 (Gastric) at doses of 3mg\/kg and 10mg\/kg Q3W for T-DXd combined with 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg\/kg QD of AZD5305. To evaluate the specificity of the combination activity in tumor cells (vs normal tissue), we further evaluated the combination in a human 2D <i>in vitro <\/i>bone marrow progenitor assay.<br \/>Results: We found that the combination had enhanced <i>in vitro <\/i>cell killing activity over single agents in 8\/27 of the models tested. The benefit was present in both Homologous Recombination Deficient (HRD) as well as Homologous Recombination proficient, suggesting it does not depend on HRD (as defined by mutations in DNA damage repair genes). Mechanistically, T-DXd activated PARP and the combination of T-DXd with AZD5305 abrogated PARP1 auto-parylation, leading to enhanced DNA damage (gH2AX, pRPA-S4\/8) and cell death (cCasp3). <i>In vivo<\/i>, the combination was well tolerated and more active than monotherapy of either compound in both KPL4 (at 30 days the growth inhibition was 95% at 10mg\/kg T-DXd, 10% at 1mg\/kg AZD5305, and 100% TGI with 97% regression with T-DXd + AZD5305) and NCI-N87 (at 41 days TGI of 74% with 10mg\/kg T-DXd, 47% with 1mg\/kg AZD5305, and 100% TGI with 40% regression for T-DXd + AZD5305; p&#60;0.0001). In an <i>in vitro <\/i>human bone marrow assay, the combination demonstrated modest enhancement over monotherapy activity (average Loewe Synergy Score of 3.1). We tested alternative doses and schedules of the combination in KPL4 <i>in vivo. <\/i>We found that reducing the dose of AZD5305 as low as 0.01mg\/kg resulted in combination benefit (100% TGI with 78% regression for combination versus 0% TGI for monotherapy on day 30). Further, 7-day delay of 0.01mg\/kg AZD5305 in combination with 10mg\/kg T-DXd also provided greater activity (&#62;100% TGI with 72% regression on day 30) vs. monotherapy T-DXd alone (95% TGI).<br \/>Conclusions: These results suggest that T-DXd combined with the next generation PARP1 inhibitor AZD5305 is a potentially active combination, with preclinical activity demonstrated in HRD and HR proficient models. Further, the dose and scheduling may warrant exploration clinically to optimize therapeutic index.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3d6dea08-a863-44bb-b174-fa184c6cfc13\/@t03B8ZFo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),DNA damage response,HER2,PARP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14955"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yann Wallez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theresa Proia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabetta Leo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Bradshaw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zena Wilson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joe’l Owusu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Azadeh Cheraghchi-Bashi-Astaneh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Staniszewska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark O’Connor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabina Cosulich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jerome Mettetal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

ADCs are comprised of a monoclonal antibody, targeting antigens expressed at higher levels on tumor cells than on normal cells, cross-linked to small molecule payloads with cytotoxic activity. Human Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) is overexpressed in a large proportion of gastric and pancreatic cancers, with restricted normal tissue expression. The monoclonal antibody targeting CLDN18.2 (IMAB362) has demonstrated promising clinical benefit in combination with chemotherapies for gastric cancer patients. However, the same antibody shows suboptimal efficacy in patients with low CLDN18.2 expression. Here we report the potent in vivo efficacy of ATG-022, a CLDN18.2 ADC, in multiple gastric cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, including those with low CLDN18.2 expression.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The binding affinity of ATG-022 with CLDN18.2 was detected by SPR and FACs analysis.

To help lifting these issues, we have developed and cross-validated a multiplex LC-MS\/MS method allowing to assay simultaneously up to 8 mAbs in plasma, including several immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., atezolizumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, rituximab, trastuzumab). Using a ready-to-use kit (mAbXmise), the method proved to be simple and rapid - covering a concentration range of 2-100 &#181;g\/ml, in line with plasma concentrations usually expected with mAbs. Inter and intra-assay precision were both &#60;15% and accuracy was comprised between 90.1 and 111.1%, thus meeting the requirements of current EMA guidelines for validating bioanalytical methods. Cross-validation using reference LC-MS\/MS or ELISA methods was performed on 7 mAbs (excluding atezolizumab since no reference method was available) with a satisfactory mean absolute bias of 10.6% (3.0-19.9%). This LC-MS\/MS method was next used as part of the Cetuximax trial (NCT-04218136), an open, non-randomized, single arm, multicentric study aiming at determining the PK\/PD relationships of Cetuximab in Head-and-Neck cancer patients with monitoring of both Cmax and Cmin levels. Patients are all treated with the 250 mg\/m&#178; QW schedule. Previous works have suggested that Cetuximab trough levels &#60; 34 &#181;g\/ml were associated with higher risk for treatment failure in Head-and-Neck patients. Patients were repeatedly sampled in a longitudinal fashion at their Cmax plus trough levels and individual PK parameters were derived using a pop-PK approach. Preliminary results on 90 samples collected from the first 25 out of the 110 patients to be included have confirmed the marked inter-individual variability in Cetuximab exposure (i.e., &#62;56% on trough levels and &#62;55% on Cmax values). Mean Cetuximab trough level was 54 &#177; 30 &#181;g\/ml (range: 12-104 &#181;g\/ml) and mean Cmax value was 211 &#177; 116 &#181;g\/ml (range: 75-418 &#181;g\/ml), with several individuals (8 out of 25, i.e., 32%) showing plasma exposure below the expected trough levels associated with efficacy. Although preliminary, our data confirm that PK variability is massive with mAbs. This observation suggests that Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, using appropriate LC-MS\/MS method, could help appraising interpatient variability at bedside and detecting individuals with exposure levels out of the range usually observed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5caac057-0bc0-4cc5-b93c-05d4dc08c7a2\/@t03B8ZFo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cetuximab,Pharmacokinetics,Mass spectrometry,Monoclonal antibodies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13836"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Clemence Marin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nihel Khoudour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurélien Millet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dorothée Lebert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pauline Bros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabienne Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Ternant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jerôme Guitton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mourad Hamimed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benoit Blanchet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastien Salas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Joseph Ciccolini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Here, we have compared such TDM + <i>in silico<\/i> approach with empirical changes in dosing performed upon clinical signs in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with Sunitinib. A total of 31 patients were monitored in our institute. All patients were treated with a standard starting dose of 50 mg QD following the 4\/2 schedule. Sunitinib and n-desethyl sunitinib trough levels were assayed at steady state by a fully validated LC-MS\/MS analysis. A PK-pop model with Bayesian estimate implemented on Monolix helped to identify individual PK parameters from a single time-point. Two different target exposures were considered (i.e., trough levels comprised between 50 and 100 ng\/ml or 0-24h AUC comprised between 1250 and 2150 ng\/ml.h). The PK model enabled to simulate both trough levels and 0-24h AUC from a single sample, regardless of the sampling time. Overall, dosing was modified empirically in about 54% of the patients after treatment started, mostly (46%) for reducing the dosing after that toxicities showed. Clinical benefit (i.e., stable disease + partial response + complete reponse) was achieved in 54 % of patients but treatment discontinuation was observed in 58% of the patients eventually, mostly because of severe side-effects. A relationship between baseline exposure levels and early onset treatment-related toxicities was found. Because of the various changes in dosing, no such relationship was found between baseline exposure levels and efficacy evaluated at 3 months. TDM showed that only 45% of the patients were in the right window for trough levels (i.e., 50-100 ng\/ml) and only 26% when considering AUC as the target exposure (i.e., 1200-2150 ng\/ml.h). Consequently, the PK\/PD model would have suggested to rapidly customize dosing in a much larger part of the patients (i.e., 84% with respect to the target AUCs). Importantly, Sunitinib dosing was empirically reduced only in 41% patients who displayed early-onset severe toxicities, whereas modelling would have immediately proposed to cut the dosing in more than 80% of those patients, thus suggesting that the safety of Sunitinib could have been improved when using our model. Although performed on a limited number of patients, this real-world study supports the hypothesis that TDM associated with PK modelling could help the prescriber to identify the best Sunitinib dosing in a quicker way than empirical change in dosing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/54e3db47-026c-4985-8e77-7cbe58e047ab\/@u03B8ZFp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sunitinib,Pharmacokinetics,Toxicity,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13831"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Laurent Ferrer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Chauvin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dr Jean-Laurent Deville<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Joseph Ciccolini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The need for new therapies that can directly or indirectly target heterogeneous tumor cell populations to inhibit cell migration in addition to proliferation is highlighted by the recent efforts to develop targeted therapies to treat the vast majority of GBM patients whose tumors impede gross-total resection and develop resistance to chemoradiation. Galectin-3, a carbohydrate-binding protein overexpressed in astrocytes, microglia\/macrophages, and the stroma of GBM tumors is a potent modulator of cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, T-cell inhibition, and M2 macrophage polarization. We and others have confirmed the association of Galectin-3 expression to lower survival in glioma patients. Additionally, tumor Galectin-3 levels have been shown to increase following exposure to temozolomide or radiation alone or in combination, thus more greatly increasing the need for targeting Galectin-3 in GBM patients following initial treatment. Here, we characterize the therapeutic effects of the anti-Galectin-3 antibody (Gal3 Ab) we have developed for the ability to inhibit GBM tumorigenic and metastatic potential in several <i>in vitro<\/i> assays and <i>in vivo <\/i>in heterotopic and orthotopic mouse models. Human GBM cells treated with Gal3 Ab show a significant decrease in cell viability, migration, and invasion <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i>, the Gal3 Ab decreases tumor burden and provides a survival benefit in combination with temozolomide compared to the current standard-of-care treatment alone.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancers, is diagnosed by exclusion of expression and\/or amplification of three biomarkers (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]).Characterized by a high risk of relapse (one half of patients with early stages experience recurrence), short overall survival and progression-free survival (life expectancy of few months after failure of first-line chemotherapy), TNBC represents a high unmet medical need. Galectin-3 plays multiple roles in tumor initiation and development via a variety of cellular processes, spanning from angiogenesis to tumor migration. Galectin-3 (Gal3) expression is induced in TNBC patients and highly correlates with poor survival, as shown by our and others&#8217; bioinformatics analysis from public database. We recently discovered and patented a series of antibodies with high specificity and affinity for Gal3, one of which is currently tested in human volunteers. This clinical candidate has shown superior pharmacokinetic properties and clean toxicity profile in GLP studies on non-human primates. Here, we show that anti-Gal3 inhibit both anchorage dependent and independent growth of TNBC cells, as well as Gal3-induced escape from NK cell killing. Also, anti-Gal3 proved to be efficacious in <i>in vivo<\/i> studies, where TNBC cells were implanted in mammary fat pads of mice and tumor progression, measured as growth of primary mass and presence of metastatic nodules in the lungs, was followed during the two months of treatment.

Previous literature suggests that decitabine activates human endogenous retroviruses which subsequently enhances expression of interferons, thereby suppressing tumor cell proliferation. Contrary to this hypothesis, our <i>in vitro<\/i> study with human and mouse breast cancer cell lines showed a positive correlation between the antiproliferative effect of decitabine and its suppressive effect on two endogenous retroviruses, the human endogenous retrovirus type K (HERV-K) and the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Decitabine stimulated proliferation of the T47D human breast cancer cell line at lower doses but inhibited cell proliferation at higher doses. Correspondingly, HERV-K transcripts (<i>env<\/i> and <i>pol<\/i>) increased at lower doses and decreased at higher doses. Interestingly, expression of the E-cadherin gene, an indicator of epithelial differentiation, followed an opposite trend. Decitabine inhibited proliferation of the mouse 4T1 breast cancer cell line and its expression of MMTV in a dose-dependent manner, while enhancing expression of the mouse E-cadherin. 4T1 cells overexpressing MMTV <i>env<\/i> became more resistant to decitabine, so was a human breast cancer cell line (BT-20) overexpressing HERV-K <i>env<\/i>, while T47D cells with HERV-K knockdown became more susceptible to the drug. Meanwhile, <i>in vivo<\/i> studies showed that decitabine successfully suppressed tumor development in BALB\/c mice inoculated with 4T1 cells.

Cytidine Deaminase (CDA) catabolizes free cytarabine in the liver, but to what extent it could affect as well the pharmacokinetics of liposomal cytarabine is yet to be investigated. Here we have studied the pharmacokinetics (PK) of released, liposomal and total cytarabine using a population-modeling approach in adult AML patients treated with CPX-351. Impact of CDA status (i.e., Poor Metabolizer (PM) vs. Extensive Metabolizer (EM)) on cytarabine exposure levels (AUC, trough levels, Cmax) and PK parameters were analyzed. All patients showed febrile neutropenia and one toxic-death was observed. Overall response rate was 75%. The ratio free:total cytarabine monitored in our patients was higher than expected (i.e., 47%). Inter-individual variability on pharmacokinetics parameters and subsequent exposure levels was &#62;60%. A trend towards severe toxicities was observed in patients with higher exposure of cytarabine. Results showed that liposomal CPX-351 led to sustained exposure with reduced clearance (Cl = 0.16 L\/h) and prolonged half-life (T1\/2 = 28 h) . Of note, liposomes were observed transiently in bone marrow on D15, with cytarabine levels 2.3-time higher than in plasma. Sequencing CDA gene was not contributive and CDA status was primarily evaluated upon phenotyping patients. PM status was found in 77% of the patients with a marked impact on cytarabine PK parameters, i.e., PM patients had higher exposure than EM patients (AUC: 5536 vs. 1784 ng\/mL.h), prolonged half-life (T1\/2: 33.9 vs. 13.7 h), and reduced clearance (Cl: 0.12 vs. 0.29 L\/h). This pilot study suggests that despite being encapsulated in a liposomal vehicle as CPX-351, cytarabine fate in the body is highly dependent upon CDA activity, suggesting that liver metabolism is only partly skipped by the nanoparticle. Here, CDA status proved to have a major impact on cytarabine PK and possibly safety in AML patients treated with CPX-351. Indeed PM patients displayed higher exposure levels with higher risk for severe non-hematological toxicities. This study suggests that CDA status could be used as a covariate to customize CPX-351 dosing in AML patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9da4a13a-a517-4a24-879b-722648d4066e\/@u03B8ZFp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liposomes,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Pharmacokinetics,Pharmacogenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13834"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Melanie Donnette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mourad Hamimed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Ciccolini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Regis Costello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laure Delassus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geoffroy Venton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Raphaelle Fanciullino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

PGx results can be determined from germline whole-exome sequencing (WES), but somatic mutations may cause discordance between tumor and germline DNA. Since clinical diagnostic sequencing in oncology frequently only includes tumor DNA, there would be clinical value in calling germline PGx genotypes from tumor DNA. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using somatic WES data to call germline PGx genotypes.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Germline and somatic WES data were obtained as part of the clinical workflow for 64 patients treated at the solid molecular tumor board clinic at Indiana University. Aldy v3.3 was implemented in LifeOmic&#8217;s Precision Health Cloud&#8482; to call PGx genotypes from somatic WES. Somatic Aldy calls were compared with previously validated Aldy germline calls for 8 genes: <i>CYP2C9<\/i>, <i>CYP2C19<\/i>, <i>CYP2D6<\/i>, <i>CYP3A4<\/i>, <i>CYP3A5<\/i>, <i>CYP4F2<\/i>, <i>DPYD<\/i>, and <i>TPMT<\/i>. Somatic read depth was &#62;100x, except for the intronic <i>CYP3A4*22<\/i> variant<i>,<\/i> which was &#62;30x.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Somatic and germline Aldy calls were compared for a total of 512 genotypes and 56 (11%) calls were discordant. Discordant calls were most common for <i>CYP2B6<\/i> (23.4%), followed by <i>CYP2D6<\/i> (14.1%), <i>CYP2C19<\/i> (10.9%), <i>CYP2C8<\/i> (6.3%), and <i>DPYD<\/i> (6.3%)<i>.<\/i> In contrast, all Aldy calls were concordant for <i>CYP3A5<\/i> and <i>TPMT<\/i>. 38 out of 64 subjects (59%) had discordant calls for at least one gene. The most common first cancer diagnoses in our cohort were colorectal (9.3%), breast (7.8%), and pancreatic (7.8%), and the rates of discordant Aldy calls did not differ by cancer type (p&#62;0.05 for all cancer types). Based on our analyses of discordant calls, we anticipate that adjusting Aldy&#8217;s thresholds for variant calling may allow Aldy to determine genotypes from somatic WES data.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>In most cases, genotype calls of drug metabolism genes from tumor DNA reflected the germline genotypes; however, additional work needs to be done to determine if the remaining discordant calls can be corrected by modifying the informatics tools or if they are due to somatic mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d9931070-4c3c-4fd6-a0e7-d08c42f2805e\/@u03B8ZFp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Pharmacogenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacogenomics,Somatic mutations,Genome,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13860"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wilberforce A.
