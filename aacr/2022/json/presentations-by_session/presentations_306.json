[{"Abstract":"Background: Colorectal adenoma detection using non-invasive faecal-based biomarkers is not yet feasible. Our primary aim was to identify differential metabolomic signatures of colorectal adenomas in faecal samples using a Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS) assay. The secondary aim was to translate this assay to an Ambient Mass ionization-based technique, DESI, for high throughput, point of care diagnostics.<br \/>Methods: Patients were prospectively recruited from the colorectal cancer clinic at Imperial College NHS Trust, UK. Patients provided fresh stool samples, prior to taking bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Specimens were collected in Fecotainer (AT Medical BV) and cooled before immediate manual homogenization, aliquoting and storage at -80<sup>o<\/sup>C. LCMS untargeted metabolomics was performed using Reversed Phase chromatography (Acquity UPLC, Xevo G2-XS QToF, <i>Waters<\/i>) in both ElectroSpray Ionization (ESI) modes. Deactivated faecal samples applied to swabs were analysed using DESI-MS (Xevo G2-XS QToF). Multivariate Statistical Analysis was performed using Python. Logistic regression (LR) classification with Leave One patient Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) was applied. Recursive Feature Elimination and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithms were used for feature elimination.<br \/>Results: 36 subjects (17 females, mean age 63.5, range 42-85) were included: 17 controls, 8 adenoma, and 11 cancer patients.<br \/>Principal Component Analysis of LCMS data from both ESI modes separated the three groups. LR with LOOCV for the adenoma group showed 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Receiver Operator Characteristic curve based on a multivariate model of the top 5 significant features showed a diagnostic ability of binary classifiers of adenoma <i>vs<\/i> cancer 0.997 (Area under the curve (AUC), 95% CI=0.944-1), adenoma <i>v<\/i> healthy 0.981 (AUC, 95% CI=0.984-1), and healthy <i>v<\/i> cancer &#38; adenoma 0.995 (AUC, 95% CI=0.931-1).<br \/>LR with LOOCV after LASSO on the DESI-MS data revealed sensitivity, 84%, and specificity, 95%, for the adenoma group. Specifically, these data suggest increased abundances of N-acyl amino acids, polyunsaturated chain fatty acids (<i>n-3 <\/i>PUFAs), in the adenoma group. Both species participate in arachidonic and linoleic acid pathways, where upregulation causes prostaglandin overproduction. Glycerophosphoserines, important in cell apoptosis, were significantly increased in cancer <i>vs<\/i> adenoma \/ controls (<i>p<\/i> &#38;lt; 0.01).<br \/>Conclusion: DESI-MS analysis of faecal samples can detect the presence of colorectal adenomas and distinguish them from cancer. A prospective trial is now under way to validate these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-01 Biological mass spectrometry and systems biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Ambient Mass Ionization,DESI,faecal metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12409"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Sani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Ford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Simon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuchen Xiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James McKenzie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefania Manetta Stavrakaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petra Paizs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tausif Huq<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Higginson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Alexander<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoltan Takats<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Kinross<\/i><\/presenter>.

This signal transduction is essential for the regulation of various cellular activities, including proper cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, survival, cell motility, and metabolism. Aberration of the mTOR cascade can be found in several types of disorders, including cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. It has been reported to correlate with acquired aggressive characteristics promoting metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence in cancer cells and more progressive phenotypes in other diseased cells. More specifically, mTORC2 signaling promotes actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cell motility, cell survival, and has been recently reported to be responsible for DNA damage control. Unlike mTORC1 that has been more thoroughly studied, molecular mechanisms of mTORC2 are yet to be elaborated. Therefore, characterization of the mTORC2 signaling pathway will provide further information needed for better understandings of the biology of diseases. Previously, we have identified multiple cytoskeleton regulators, including actin-binding and microtubule-associated proteins as binding partners of mTORC2 in glioblastoma cells by affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS). In this work, we provided extensive characterization of mTORC2 interactome in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells focusing on microtubule-associated proteins. Interestingly, apart from many MAP proteins found in non-neuronal cells (glioblastoma), we identified Tau isoforms and their regulatory proteins such as Tau kinases from affinity-purified mTORC2 in neuroblastoma cells. The quantitative proteomic analyses of mTORC2-interacting proteins in various cellular conditions were performed to help determine the dynamics of the mTORC2-associated microtubule network. These novel protein-protein interactions acquired from this study suggested additional mTORC2 functions in different types of brain cells, which might also be beneficial to the understandings of neurodegenerative diseases in addition to cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c729c22c-ed9c-4f4a-a4b0-8290ba77c0d0\/@A03B8ZB1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-03 Proteomics and signaling networks,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,Protein-protein interactions,Microtubules,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12410"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Narawit Pacharakullanon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Piriya Wongkongkathep<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fuyuhiko Tamanoi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph A.

While initial responses to therapy are favorable, the duration of response is short and overcoming therapeutic resistance has proven difficult. A better understanding of the tumor cell biology and resistance mechanisms may shed light onto novel therapeutic targets that improve long-term outcome. In this study, we performed an exhaustive analysis to include deep tumor phenotyping, drug sensitivity profiling and comprehensive omic characterization. These datasets were included in integrative pharmaco-phenotypic-multiomic analyses to identify targets and biomarkers associated with cellular phenotype and drug response. Our results reveal that the major cellular discriminant within the cellular phenotype is CD34 expression, which associates with a high PDK-mediated metabolic profile and cytarabine sensitivity. Tumors exhibiting cytarabine resistance associate with a CD34-negative cellular phenotype and molecular characteristics such as MYC copy number gain, and increased expression of SAMDH1, FBP1 and TYMP proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e0bcd2e-ca9e-4863-a535-ebe96b8330b6\/@A03B8ZB1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Multiomics,Drug sensitivity,Tumor biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12412"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Gilad Silberberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Bandana Vishwakarama<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon Walling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chelsea Riveley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandra Audia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianna Zipeto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ido Sloma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Wesa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Ritchie<\/i><\/presenter>.

CyTOF&#174; mass cytometry is a high-plex, single-cell analysis platform that uses isotopically pure metal-labeled antibodies. The major advantage of CyTOF is its ability to resolve 40-plus markers in a single panel without compensation, making mass cytometry ideal for routine immunophenotyping. The autosampler module of CyTOF XT&#8482; provides significant time savings by allowing automated sample acquisition. Tubes of pelleted stained samples are loaded into the Autosampler carousel, and the samples are resuspended with EQ&#8482; Calibration Beads for acquisition. User input is only required during instrument startup, tuning, and batch setup. The added automation of CyTOF XT provides a streamlined workflow for suspension mass cytometry. Testing was performed to ensure that the data obtained on CyTOF XT was comparable to manual acquisition systems. The performance of CyTOF XT was tested in parallel with its predecessor, Helios&#8482;. Several workflows and applications for suspension mass cytometry including sample barcoding with the Cell-ID&#8482; 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit, and surface, cytoplasmic, and nuclear staining and phosphostaining were evaluated on human PBMC. Manual gating analysis was performed to assess population frequencies and median intensities for each marker. Resolution index was calculated to assess how well positive and negative populations separated from each other. There was no significant difference between population frequencies analyzed between the two CyTOF systems. Moreover, samples acquired on CyTOF XT, on average, resulted in greater signal resolution between positive and negative populations compared to Helios. The Maxpar Direct Immune Profiling System was also compared on CyTOF XT and Helios using human whole blood and PBMC. The Maxpar&#174; Direct&#8482; Immune Profiling Assay&#8482; and Maxpar Pathsetter&#8482; software were developed as a sample-to-answer system for human immune profiling using CyTOF. The Maxpar Direct Immune Profiling Assay includes an optimized panel of 30 unique markers in a dry, single-tube format. Maxpar Pathsetter is an automated software used to report population statistics, stain assessments, and relevant data plots for the panel. The automated staining assessment in Maxpar Pathsetter was compared between files acquired on CyTOF XT and Helios. Comparable population frequencies were obtained between the two acquisition systems, and improved staining assessment was observed on CyTOF XT. Overall, these studies demonstrate that CyTOF XT generates better signal resolution as compared to Helios. The automated acquisition of CyTOF XT enables researchers to streamline immunophenotyping of human samples while accurately and reproducibly monitoring changes in immune cell subsets.<br \/>For Research Use Only.

However, questions remain regarding the heterogeneity of the CAR T cell infusion products that lead to differential clinical outcomes and side effects, including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. The purpose of this study is to identify biomarkers and T cell subpopulations within 1) leukapheresis samples of patients receiving CD19 CAR T cell therapy and 2) pre-infusion manufactured CAR T cell products to identify correlates with clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that different manufacturing practices used to generate CAR T cells from the patient&#8217;s leukapheresis T cells drive heterogeneity within the infusion products that drive differential patient outcomes, and that cell intrinsic properties within the leukapheresis T cells drive phenotypic dispositions observed in the infusion products.<br \/>Leukapheresis samples and pre-infusion CAR T cells were obtained from pediatric and adult B-ALL patients enrolled in CD19 CAR T cell clinical trials. Briefly, leukapheresis T cells from pediatric patients were CD4\/8 sorted and then stimulated with CD3\/CD28 beads followed by CAR transduction. Pediatric CD4 CAR T cells were cultured with IL-7 + IL-15 while CD8 CAR T cells were cultured with IL-2 + IL-15. CAR T cells from adults were stimulated with LCLs expressing CD19. To identify T cell subpopulations and biomarkers leukapheresis T cells and CAR T cells from each patient were stained with two mass cytometry panels: 1) a phenotype panel of antibodies to characterize surface markers, transcription factors and chemokine receptors and 2) a functional panel of antibodies specific for cytokines to broadly characterize the secretion profile of leukapheresis and CAR T cells upon stimulation with PMA and Ionomycin. Additional multi-omic profiling was performed with CITE-seq and 10X Chromium on leukapheresis samples and CAR T cells of select adult patients to provide in depth analysis on transcriptomic drivers of phenotypes observed within CAR T cell infusion products.<br \/>We hierarchically clustered leukapheresis T cells and CAR T cells and correlated the abundance of T cell subclusters within each patient to their neurotoxicity grade (0-5). We determined that CD4 CAR T cells that secrete elevated levels of IL-3 upon stimulation correlate with an increased risk of severe neurotoxicity (designated as grades 3-5) within our pediatric cohort. Identification of IL-3 as a driver of neurotoxicity within the CD4 infusion products may inform strategies to improve manufacturing practices used to generate safer CAR T cell products.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a0307fc2-c11a-4f94-bcde-0dfb8ee14443\/@B03B8ZB2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Toxicity,Biomarkers,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12415"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tony Chour<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandre Hirayama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ye Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alyssa Sheih<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Summer Zhuang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Wilson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vicky Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raphael Gottardo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cameron Turtle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Gardner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evan Newell<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, it remains unclear why some patients show upfront resistance to the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>i, and the mechanisms of adaptive resistance. To enhance the efficacy of the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>i, several combination regimens are in clinical trials which includes Sotorasib combination with MEK, PD1, SHP2, pan-HER, PD-L1, and EGFR inhibitors. However, it remains unclear how to precisely identify an appropriate cohort for analysis and predict tumor-centric combination strategies that would be effective in the clinic. We hypothesized that subsets of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> lung cancer could be identified using transcriptomics and proteomics. To test our hypothesis, we performed hierarchical clustering of the microarray dataset on 87 NSCLC KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumors and identified three novel transcriptomic subtypes - Subtype 1 had higher expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, which are related to cellular adhesion, and lower expression of EMT genes. Subtype 2 had low ECM expression, high expression in EMT and cell cycle pathway genes suggesting that this is a more invasive subtype. Subtype 2 had lowest expression of small molecule metabolism, suggesting it may be more responsive to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>i. Subtype 3 had the lowest expression in interferon gamma\/cytotoxic T-cell, T-cell, and B-cell pathways. Subtype 3 had the highest expression of small molecule metabolism, suggesting that it could be more resistant to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>i. Having observed these unique clusters, we next hypothesized that mass spectrometry-based expression and phosphoproteomic analysis (pY and pS\/T\/Y) will further refine these clusters and help identifying new subsets. Our previous work by Stewart <i>et al.,<\/i> demonstrated the importance of proteomics integrated with genomic and transcriptomic analyses to define molecular subtypes in a cohort of 108 squamous cell lung cancer patients. We believe that a similar integrated proteogenomic study is important in context of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumors to understand the signaling diversity and phenotypically categorized them to optimize patient enrichment schemes for effective combination therapy. For that purpose, we performed an integrative proteogenomic analysis of 75 KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumors (55 lung, 12 large bowel adenocarcinomas and 8 PDXs) with full clinical follow up and pathology data. We are presently classifying the 75 KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumors into phosphoproteomic subtypes. We also carried out targeted exome sequencing for cancer-specific genes. Next, we plan to leverage existing gene expression microarray data and add exome sequencing proteomics, and phosphoproteomics for a comprehensive, protein-centric characterization on these tumors. Importantly, the inclusion of 8 PDXs being co-processed and co-analyzed along with the tumors will enable rapid follow-up experiments to validate the findings into preclinical therapy trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aa10804f-52c2-498b-b149-f6108a7d0926\/@B03B8ZB2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-03 Proteomics and signaling networks,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Proteomics,Resistance,Tumor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12417"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hitendra Singh Solanki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul A.

It provides on-line proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis for the data in The National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), with a focus on tumor and adjacent normal comparisons and correlations between different protein or phosphorylation levels or between protein abundances and mRNA expressions. The web platform is designed for biologists and clinicians wishing to make rapid searches in a user friendly environment. The platform analysis has several advantages compared with standard analytical methods: 1) Faster analysis on-line; 2) More user-friendly; 3) Less need for bioinformatics expertise to perform analyses. Current cProSite includes 11 tumor types*. The web platform includes the following features: 1) Can compare selected protein abundance between tumors and normal adjacent tissues and visualization of fold-changes between paired tumor and control tissue. 2) Can compare selected levels of individual phosphorylation sites or levels of phosphorylation site per protein abundance and visualization of fold-changes between tumors and normal adjacent tissues. 3) Can correlate protein abundance, phosphorylation site levels, or phosphorylation site level per protein abundance between two selected proteins. 4) Can correlate selected protein abundance with its mRNA expression level if the data are available. The cProSite export feature allows users to download the analyzed data. In addition, search outcomes from cProSite can be used for clinical data validation and novel target identification. For example, cProSite can be used to validate findings from other studies; the upregulation of the Hyaluronan Mediated Motility Receptor (Rhamm\/HMMR) protein abundance in non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma detected by tissue microarrays was confirmed by cProSite analysis. cProSite can also be used for hypothesis-generation and lead to hypothesis testing. In one example, cProSite identified several upregulated phosphorylation sites in the ECT2 (G2\/M phase protein Epithelia Cell Transforming 2) protein in several tumor types. Consistent with that observation, mass spectrometry results showed increased phosphorylation levels from those phosphorylation sites in synchronized lung cancer cell lines in the G2\/M phase.<br \/>* The 11 tumor types in cProSite are: breast cancer, colon cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous carcinoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, stomach cancer, and uterine cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cec4404a-66c8-4ec0-937b-451a9def01cf\/@B03B8ZB2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-01 Biological mass spectrometry and systems biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomic analysis,Bioinformatics,Phosphorylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12418"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dunrui Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolan Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Chieh Nancy Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Sanchez-Solana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kailing Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ben Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Jenkins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brajendra K.

AXL can be activated by homodimerization after binding with its ligand, growth arrest specific 6 protein (Gas6) or by heterodimerization with other RTKs. AXL overexpression and\/or activation have been reported to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration\/invasion and to induce resistance to targeted therapy. However, the AXL downstream signaling network has not yet been fully elucidated.<br \/>Methods: We employed a CRISPR-CAS9-based knockout technology to create AXL inducible knockout cells in a human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, HCC1395. In order to explore the downstream signaling events driven by AXL, we induced AXL knockout for 72 hours and used a 6-plex TMT-labeling-based quantitative proteomic approach to characterize the protein phosphorylation alterations induced by AXL knockout. IMAC and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (pY1000)-based phosphopeptide enrichment methods were used to comprehensively quantify the phosphoproteome changes induced by AXL knockout.<br \/>Results: In this study, we identified 38,525 phospho serine\/threonine sites and 1,427 phosphotyrosine sites. In response to AXL knockout, 1,581 phospho serine\/threonine sites and 40 phosphotyrosine sites showed significant differences between AXL-KO and AXL-WT groups with &#62;1.5-fold change and p&#60;0.05 as the cutoff. Among them, 982 phosphoserine\/threonine sites and 30 phosphotyrosine sites were decreased, while 599 phospho serine\/threonine sites and 10 phosphotyrosine sites were increased in AXL-KO cells. Signaling pathway enrichment analysis revealed that suppressing AXL expression could inhibit multiple important cancer related signaling pathways, including cell cycle, focal adhesion, MAPK signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway and mTOR signaling pathway.<br \/>Conclusion: Quantitative analysis of the phosphoproteome driven by AXL demonstrated that AXL plays a pivotal role in regulating canonical oncogenic signaling but also signaling pathways involved in RNA processing and DNA repair. Our data also suggest that targeting AXL could suppress these oncogenic signaling pathways and have therapeutic potential to improve clinical outcomes for patients with AXL overexpression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec20cd81-19f9-4baf-9877-2f52121b8e36\/@B03B8ZB2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-03 Proteomics and signaling networks,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Axl,Breast cancer,Proteomics,Phosphorylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12420"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Li Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Pearson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuning Xiong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santosh Renuse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ran Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jodi M.

One of the most popular methods, imaging mass cytometry (IMC), primarily differs from traditional methods in that it uses 1) metal labels rather than fluorescent tags and 2) allows for the addition of all primary antibodies at one time rather than sequentially. Success in IMC, however, can be hindered by loss of antibody activity, poor optimization, or insufficient testing post-conjugation. The aim of this study was to assess whether thoroughly analyzing antibody activity before and after metal conjugation could serve as a predictor for success in IMC.Carrier-free antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) were conjugated using Fluidigm&#8217;s Maxpar&#174; X8 Antibody Labelling Kits. Metal-antibody pairings were designated based on the protein&#8217;s expression level. Post-conjugation activity testing was performed on tissue microarrays using both citrate and tris HIER methods. Initial DAB testing was done first to observe any loss of signal, followed by IF testing using Dylight-conjugated secondary antibodies, to determine exposure time limitations. Initial testing concentration for each target was based off the validated working concentration provided on the data sheet for each antibody. If a loss of activity was observed, further IF testing was performed to recover activity via titration experiments. Optimal exposure times were obtained for each sample using the Vectra Polaris imaging system. The conjugates were then assessed in IMC using Fluidigm&#8217;s Hyperion System.A set of 60 antibodies were evaluated with 30% showing decreased activity post-conjugation, ranging from a minor reduction of signal to complete loss. Exposure times taken from each target were determined to be a valid predictor of success in IMC. A sliding scale showed that targets with &#60;200ms exposure times would be successful while those with &#62;300ms failed. Furthermore, several antibodies that showed a complete loss of signal post-conjugation were able to recover that signal via an increase in antibody concentration.The utilization of pre- and post-conjugation activity tests on metal-conjugated antibodies provides key insights on imaging mass cytometry outcomes. Exposure times from IF serve as one of the most crucial predictors for success. Additionally, the use of increased concentration gradients for first-pass &#8220;failed&#8221; antibodies can often recover any loss of activity. This loss of activity wastes time and money if not identified prior to use in imaging mass cytometry experiments. Building this sort of assessment into early IMC experiment planning can yield a streamlined approach to testing and evaluating potential IMC targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/339af192-8807-42de-b614-d57385fe547d\/@B03B8ZB2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Mass spectrometry,Assay development,Immunoassay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12421"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Danielle Fails<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Spencer<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have recently determined that coibamide A binds to the Sec61 translocon channel at a site that is close, but not identical, to the binding site of the peptide\/polyketide natural product apratoxin A. As the majority of secreted proteins in mammalian cells are trafficked through the conventional secretory pathway via the Sec61 translocon, this raised the possibility that coibamide A and apratoxin A block import and secretion of different Sec61 client proteins. In the present study, we analyzed and compared the secretome of human U87-MG glioblastoma cells in the presence and absence of both marine natural products.<br \/>U87-MG glioblastoma cells were treated with coibamide A (5 nM), apratoxin A (5 nM), or vehicle for 24 h. The growth media was then replaced with serum-free media for a further 24 h. Tryptic proteomic samples were generated from cell-free conditioned media and analyzed on a LC-coupled Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. The high-resolution Orbitrap mass analyzer was used to both identify precursor ions for tandem mass (MS2) analysis in the ion trap mass analyzer and to quantitate those ions (MS1). Secreted proteins were identified from peptide&#8211;spectrum matches to the human protein database using a decoy database to assign an FDR and quantified from their MS1 ion intensities.<br \/>Comparison of mass spectrometric data against the human secretome database revealed 175 proteins in the U87-MG cell secretome that were identified with high confidence. Differences between coibamide A and apratoxin A treatment were not significant, however both Sec61 inhibitors induced significant suppression of the U87-MG secretome relative to vehicle-treated cells. Treatment with coibamide A or apratoxin A resulted in the reduction of 75% of quantifiable secretome (131 proteins). Of the remaining 44 proteins, 34 are directed to intracellular organelles or contain a motif associated with retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and 10 were not suppressed with treatment but were hypothesized to be Sec61 clients.<br \/>Malignant glioblastoma cells secrete proteins into the extracellular space and use complex intercellular signaling mechanisms for a survival advantage. Our results indicate that broad-acting inhibitors of Sec61-dependent co-translational translocation block the progression of a significant percentage of the U87-MG glioblastoma cell secretome including several proteins that have previously been detected as biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or urine of brain tumor patients.

Previous attempts to characterize Hsp70 interactions have been limited by their transient nature and inability of current technologies to distinguish direct vs bridged interactions. We report the novel use of cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to comprehensively characterize the budding yeast Hsp70 protein interactome. In doing so, we have uncovered not only a new set of Hsp70 client proteins but show that these clients bind at multiple sites on Hsp70, including the N-terminal NBD. Notably, many of the Hsp70 interactions with client proteins are in close proximity to biologically important post translational modifications (PTMs). Using this approach, we have gained fundamental new insights into Hsp70 function, including definitive evidence of Hsp70 self-association as well as multi-point interaction with its client proteins. In addition to identifying a novel set of direct Hsp70 interactors which can be used to probe chaperone function in cells, we have also identified a suite of PTM-associated Hsp70 interactions. The majority of these PTMs have not been previously reported and appear to be critical in the regulation of client protein function. These data indicate that one of the mechanisms by which PTMs contribute to protein function is by facilitating interaction with chaperones. Taken together, we propose that XL-MS analysis of chaperone complexes may be used as a unique way to identify biologically important PTMs on client proteins. All in all, our data suggest that our XL-MS approach to chaperone interactome characterization can also be used as a novel way to identify biologically important and previously unknown PTMs on client proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-03 Proteomics and signaling networks,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Mass spectrometry,Protein-protein interactions,Proteomic analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12424"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>.

However, mass spectrometry (MS) &#8211; based proteomics has not been possible at large scale due to limited dynamic range, complex workflow and high experimental cost per sample. Antibody-based methods, although widely used in targeted proteomics for their better sensitivity, have been limited to the profiling of a few hundred selected proteins, partly due to the limited availability of antibody pairs.&nbsp;NanoMosaic has demonstrated antibody-aptamer&nbsp;sandwich assays on the MosaicNeedle<sup>TM<\/sup> platform. This expands the content size from a few hundred to a few thousand, achievable in one reaction with high sensitivity and specificity and low cross-reactivity.<br \/>MosaicNeedles<sup>TM<\/sup> are densely integrated nanoneedle sensors fabricated on a planar substrate. 94,000 sensors with more than 2 billion total nanoneedles can be integrated on to a standard SBS plate, which can also be grouped into 96, 384 or 1536 formats. Each sensor contains an array of nanoneedles, dedicated to detecting one analyte of interest. All nanoneedles comprising the same sensor are functionalized with the same capture antibodies or aptamers. At low analyte concentration, the binding of proteins to the nanoneedles follows a Poisson distribution. Therefore, statistically, no more than one molecule is bound per nanoneedle. A further addition of aptamers or antibodies will form a sandwich complex with the target analyte. Since each of the nanoneedles has an intrinsic optical resonance spectrum and will red-shift as the sandwich complex forms on its surface, the number of analytes can be quantitated by simply counting the number of nanoneedles that display a color change. At high analyte concentration, each nanoneedle has more than one analyte, so the number of analytes can be calculated by averaging the spectrum shifts of all nanoneedles. This combined single molecule counting (digital) and spectrum shift (analog) analysis allows the platform to detect both high abundance and low abundance protein analytes in one reaction. We have demonstrated that the aptamer-antibody assay on the MosaicNeedle<sup>TM <\/sup>platform achieves better sensitivity than the well-developed antibody-pair assay. It also achieves larger dynamic range and alleviates the antibody cross-reactivity by refining aptamers during the SELEX process.<br \/>The scalability in manufacturing nanoneedles combined with the low sample requirement and no fluorescent labeling all help to drive down the cost-per-protein to enable large-scale, unbiased proteomics. We envision researchers will use MosaicNeedle<sup>TM<\/sup> platform for both the upstream target discovery phase and then transfer seamlessly to the downstream validation phase by building customized and targeted panels for proteins of high interest that emerge from the discovery phase.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c56805ca-ab73-474d-912b-c8301f70ec68\/@B03B8ZB2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Drug discovery,Diagnosis,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12427"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qimin Quan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alaina Kaiser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua Ritchey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joe Wilkinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Geanacopoulos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Boyce<\/i><\/presenter>.

Plasma potentially contains molecular clues coming from all the tissues that make up an organism, thus possibly enable the holistic analysis of the health state of an individual. The major challenge in plasma protein analysis is the 10<sup>13<\/sup>- fold dynamic range and the strong prevalence of few, very abundant proteins. Depletion of the most abundant proteins is used to increase coverage of the plasma proteome. To be able to profile human plasma at large scale and at maximal depth, we developed and optimized two main aspects. Firstly, we automated the depletion of the top 14 most abundant proteins in human plasma to a throughput of 40 depletions per day per setup. A comparison of native and depletion workflows with a controlled quantitative experiment demonstrated that depletion led to a significant increase in the number of identifications (&#38;gt200%) and number of true hits (&#38;gt300% at controlled actual FDR &#38;lt1%), while conserving quantitative accuracy. Secondly, we further optimized FAIMS-DIA methods for deep plasma proteome profiling and applied the optimized workflow to a cohort coming from the deadliest five solid tumor types. To research large cohorts&#8217; feasibility, we analyzed a cohort comprising 30 each of healthy, lung, colorectal, pancreatic, breast and prostate cancer. Altogether, we processed 180 samples (plus 24 quality controls) and quantified 2,732 proteins, of which 1,804 in at least 50% of the runs. Based on quality control samples, we could characterize variance introduced on each level, all much lower than the inter-individual variability. We reached 8 orders of magnitude of dynamic range, within this range we covered extensively tissue leakage proteome, interleukins and signaling proteins such as Egf, Klk3 (PSA), Akt1, Cd86, Met, Erbb2 and Cd33. Using machine learning we reduced to an average of 129 (5% of the quantified proteins) biomarker candidates per cancer type, making biological interpretation more feasible while enabling classification of health and disease. The model performance was 86-100% on the 20% hold-out validation set when healthy and overall disease status were considered. Importantly, the biomarker candidates were predominantly (70%) coming from low abundance regions clearly demonstrating the need to measure deeply because they would be missed by shallow plasma profiling. Hence, we showed that our automated plasma depletion workflow has the potential to enable the unbiased and reproducible quantification of more than 2,700 proteins across very large cohorts and unlock biomarker candidate panels in different cancer types. Furthermore, with the latest analytical method iteration applied to a subset of the samples, we could quantify more than 3,500 proteins, demonstrating the full potential of the workflow.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f18aa0f2-a8a3-4c62-bfdb-7bf89ab1f317\/@t03B8ZB3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Plasma,Serum,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12428"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marco Tognetti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kamil Sklodowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastian Mueller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominique Kamber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Muntel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuehan Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roland Bruderer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukas Reiter<\/i><\/presenter>.

Clinical diagnoses and treatment decisions have traditionally been made with spatially resolved techniques like immunohistochemistry, that offer a wealth of information about cellular morphology and the spatial context of cells but are limited to a single plex. Newer technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, identify cell subpopulations within tissue but do not capture their spatial distribution or intercellular interactions <i>in situ<\/i>. Here we present the analysis of clinical FFPE tumor samples using ChipCytometry, a novel precise spatial multiplexing technology that offers high-plex biomarker analysis, without compromising spatial context. ChipCytometry combines iterative immuno-fluorescent staining with high-dynamic range imaging to facilitate quantitative phenotyping with single-cell resolution. Standard FCS files are generated from multichannel OME-TIFF images, enabling identification of cellular phenotypes via flow cytometry-like hierarchical gating. In this study, we identify and quantify immune and epithelial cell phenotypes and subtypes in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer FFPE samples. The results show precise expression levels for each marker in the assay in each individual cell in the sample, while maintaining spatial information about each cell.

For patients with residual invasive cancer post radical cystectomy there is no standard of care and high mortality. Previous TCGA projects focused on pre-NAC MIBC genomic and transcriptomic alterations and identified 5 molecular subtypes with differential risk and response. For this study we hypothesized that comprehensive proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of MIBC prior to NAC will further define mechanisms responsible for chemotherapy resistance, and identify specific and actionable targeted therapies for patients with NAC-resistant tumors.<br \/>Methods: OCT-embedded and flash frozen tissue samples from 143 eligible patients were processed and tested for proteomics quality control (QC). Samples containing &#62;45% tumor content, less than 10% muscle content and &#62;2,000 protein identifications in a single-shot quality control assay were selected for deep-scale proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling. A final cohort of 60 samples (52 pre-treatment and 8 patient-matched post-treatment tumors) were multiplexed using tandem mass tags (TMT-11), fractionated by basic reverse phase chromatography and analyzed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS).<br \/>Results: Over 12,000 proteins were identified in total, and 8,353 proteins identified in all samples, including 425 kinases and 77 targets of FDA approved cancer therapies. Principal component analysis identified two distinct resistant clusters and one sensitive cluster. The samples were clustered based on the 5 TCGA subtypes which resulted in the sub stratification of the resistant clusters into two resistance-enriched basal-squamous clusters (BS1 and BS2 respectively), one infiltrated-luminal cluster (L1), one sensitive luminal cluster (L2) and one intermediary cluster (L3) (with 86% samples resistant). UV response, Epithelial to Mesenchymal transition and Myogenesis were significantly elevated in both L1 and L3 (resistant) relative to L2 (sensitive). Similar, these pathways are significantly altered in L1 relative to L3. EGFR, CDK6, ITPKC and CSNK1 were elevated in the B4 subtype, all of which are potentially druggable targets. Matched samples and phosphoproteomics data will be presented.<br \/>Conclusion: Surrounding non-tumor tissue can obfuscate true tumor signatures in MIBC, cohort selection through stringent pathologic QC allows proteomic profiling to identify tumor features that correlate with NAC resistance. This dataset provides proof of principle that actionable targets and subtype distinctions can be identified through discovery proteomics and further analysis in NAC treated cohorts are justified.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/acfb8715-a946-4a3a-b4db-dffb1eebe9a7\/@t03B8ZB3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-01 Biological mass spectrometry and systems biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Proteomics,Mass spectrometry,Cancer markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12430"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"cae96912-1870-4976-83ae-e9b4773ded59","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cae96912-1870-4976-83ae-e9b4773ded59\/@t03B8ZB3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew V.

Immunotherapy treatment regimes frequently target the PD1 pathway and can be highly effective. Despite successes some patients remain unresponsive and a better understanding of what underlies these non-responders could enable better patient treatment stratification and an overall higher positive response rate. Here using unbiased mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomics profiling, we sought to identify protein biomarker signatures in patients with metastatic melanoma that correlate with the patients&#8217; intervention responses. Via this discovery-based approach we identify a panel of protein biomarkers that correlate with an improved treatment response and could serve as a panel for patient stratification prior to commencement of immunotherapy regimes.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples were used for unbiased quantification of proteins using data-independent acquisition (DIA) LC-MS technology and Biognosys&#8217; Spectronaut software. Patient samples were analyzed at the start of treatment (PD1 inhibitor) and classified as responders (n = 9) or non-responders (n = 15) at 3 months post-treatment. Significant protein expression changes between the two groups was determined by t-test (p &#60; 0.01, log<sub>2<\/sub> fold-change &#62; 0.58) and further machine learning-assisted analysis was conducted. Additionally, patient&#8217;s tumor mutational burden (TMB) was analyzed.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Analysis of the FFPE samples from anti-PD1-treated metastatic melanoma patients resulted in the identification and quantification of more than 9,000 proteins in total with an average of nearly 8,000 proteins per sample. Stratification of the patients into responders and non-responders led to the identification of 103 proteins that are significantly up- or down-regulated between the groups. Interestingly, proteins associated with ubiquitination pathways were significantly enriched among the identified regulated proteins with 7 proteins having significantly lower abundance in responders when compared to non-responders including various members of the ubiquitin ligase family. Further, a proteomic signature was identified that characterizes the responder and non-responder groups.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> In this study we demonstrate the power of unbiased proteomic profiling for the characterization of melanoma patients and their responses to PD1-targeted immunotherapy. We identify a set of biomarkers associated with ubiquitination pathways that correlate with treatment outcome although these findings need to further be confirmed in orthogonal cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Biomarkers,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12431"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Nigel Beaton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Treiber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Juncker-Jensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin-Xing Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Martinez Gomez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Levesque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jakob Vowinkel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The low survival rate of pancreatic cancer is due to the challenges in early detection of disease, highlighting the need for early diagnostic test development. While cancer signatures are less challenging to identify at the localized pancreatic tumor via biopsy, cancer signals found in the bloodstream due to cellular leakage, metastasis, signaling, innate immune response, remain of key interest due to reduced invasive sampling. The key challenges encountered in liquid biopsy cancer biomarker discovery studies are analyte degradation and dilution in a complex biological matrix, which limits high specificity and sensitivity measurements. To overcome these challenges, PrognomiQ has developed a comprehensive multi-omics platform that facilitates uncovering previously untapped information to gain a more holistic biological perspective at unprecedented depths and integrate molecular signatures across complex levels of biology. Implementation of this approach has led to the discovery of new pancreatic cancer-specific biomarkers and a deeper understanding of the integrated pathways of pancreatic cancer. In this case-control study, the plasma proteome and metabolome data were collected from 193 human plasma samples comprising 92 pancreatic cancer and 104 healthy subjects utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Subject samples were collected post-diagnosis, but pre-treatment for cancer subjects versus non-cancer controls. Sample collection and handling were the same for all samples. In our initial analysis, we detected 3,381 proteins in all samples (minimum of 3 samples per class), and utilizing a Bonferroni correction (FDR = 0.05) we showed 124 proteins to be statistically significant. We also determined ~200 lipids out of 678 total lipids and 49 of 299 metabolites present in all samples (minimum of 3 samples per class) to be statistically significant with a Bonferroni correction (FDR = 0.05). The detected analytes (proteins, lipids, and metabolites) are both known, and unknown, to have an association with pancreatic cancer. Analysis of the data collected from the described cohort will continue to determine Analysis is ongoing to integrate the multi-omics datasets and determine multivariate statistical performance to detect pancreatic cancer.<br \/>Conclusion: The intent of this cohort and study was to detect biological signal for pancreatic cancer, and this preliminary analysis suggests there are significant differences between classes in the samples as collected. It remains to be seen if combining features within and across analyte classes improve detection. This is a case-control study, not an intent to test study but shows promise for the detection of pancreatic cancer across a multitude of analyte classes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ee4f8ee-4c12-4e94-8497-2607d5f2055c\/@t03B8ZB3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Biomarkers,Pancreatic cancer,Diagnosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18392"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bruce Wilcox<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Blume<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kavya Swaminathan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Preston Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manoj Khadka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jared Deyarmin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saividya Ramaswamy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuya Kodama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Young<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chinmay Belthangady<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manway Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mi Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Ma<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this work, we present computational modeling demonstrating the feasibility of this goal and experimental application of the approach leveraging single-molecule protein measurements to identify a small number of model proteins. The implementation of PrISM as presented works by acquiring sequential affinity reagent binding measurements on single protein molecules. Counterintuitively, using affinity reagents with &#8220;poor&#8221; specificity (i.e. cross-reacting to many proteins) enables identification of tens of thousands of proteins with only hundreds of affinity reagents. To experimentally demonstrate PrISM, we use a small number of affinity reagents to quantify a larger number of proteins. In simulations, PrISM is able to identify more than 98% of proteins in human, mouse, yeast, and <i>E. <\/i>coli using 300 affinity reagents targeting short trimer epitopes. PrISM is robust to experimental confounders including non-specific binding and noisy, incomplete, or inaccurate estimation of affinity reagent to protein binding characteristics. Simulations of the approach with a chip containing 10 billion protein molecules measured in parallel show a dynamic range of detection of up to 9.5 and 11.5 orders of magnitude for HeLa cells and plasma, respectively. Using such a chip, the PrISM method can identify and quantify over 90% of the human proteome in a single experiment, potentially revolutionizing biomarker discovery and cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0099f956-b0d7-40cf-bf47-2628b28fb63e\/@t03B8ZB3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Plasma,Molecular profiling,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20004"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jarrett D.
