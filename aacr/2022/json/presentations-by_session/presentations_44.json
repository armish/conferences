We use single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to profile 18 matched pairs of patient tumor and orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (O-PDXs) and present a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of RMS. We show that that RMS tumors recapitulate the spectrum of embryonal myogenesis with malignant cells expressing transcriptomic states mimicking that of developing paraxial mesoderm, myoblast, and differentiating myocytes. The two predominant subtypes of pediatric RMS, fusion-negative embryonal RMS (ERMS) and fusion-positive alveolar (ARMS) have different patterns of heterogeneity, and the cells mimicking the most primitive mesoderm-like state are enriched in ERMS.<br \/>To better understand the relationship between developmental states, we employed lentiviral barcoding to show that the three states are interrelated, and that RMS cells are able to transition between developmental states. Epigenetic profiling, using single-nucleus ATAC-sequencing, show heterogeneity of developmental states within RMS tumors are reflected in the chromatin accessibility within myogenic core regulatory superenhancers.<br \/>Using matched patient samples from a clinical trial and orthotopic patient-derived xenografts, we then show chemotherapy eliminates the most proliferative component with features of myoblasts; after treatment, the quiescent immature population with features of paraxial mesoderm expands to reconstitute the developmental hierarchy of the original tumor. Next, we employed a three-compartment mathematical model to model the dynamics of cell selection with RMS; by combining data generated from lentivirally barcoded O-PDXs treated with chemotherapy to our computational model, we predict that partial elimination of mesoderm-like cells during therapy drive clonal selection within RMS. Lastly, we utilize systems biology approaches to infer hidden drivers within the mesoderm-like cells. We discovered that this population is dependent on EGFR signaling and is sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. Using an ex vivo organoid model and O-PDXs, we show that combining chemotherapy with targeted EGFR inhibitors results in improved long-term responses. Taken together, this data serves as a proof-of-concept that targeting each developmental state in RMS is an effective strategy for improving outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-04 Pediatric cancer tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Intratumoral heterogeneity,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anand G.
