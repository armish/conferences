[{"Abstract":"<b>Background &#38; Purpose:<\/b><b> <\/b>Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common and aggressive subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, and is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Upregulation of purine degradation pathway is observed in LUAD. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in purine catabolism by converting hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. The altered expression and activity of XOR in cancer tissues are usually associated with prognosis of cancer, while its role in LUAD remains unknown.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> XOR expression in LUAD tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. XOR knock-out LUAD cells were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 system. Clonogenic survival of LUAD cells was determined by crystal violet staining. The expression of genes involving in unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy was detected by RT-qPCR and the protein level was detected by Western blotting. Autophagic flux was observed by immunofluorescent microscopy. The level of amino acids and ATP\/ADP\/AMP were determined by UPLC-QTOFMS. Metabolic flux was analyzed by radio-labeled metabolites measured by UPLC-QTOFMS.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> XOR is highly expressed in LUAD and significantly associated with poor clinical prognosis. Knocking out or inhibition of XOR attenuated the survival of starved LUAD cells. Nucleoside supplementation rescued the survival of starved LUAD cells upon XOR inhibition, while inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) impended the process, indicating that ribose produced by nucleoside degradation is required for the XOR-mediated the survival of LUAD cells. Accordingly, metabolic flux revealed that ribose derived from nucleoside fueled key carbon metabolic pathways to sustain the survival of starved LUAD cells. Mechanistically, downregulation of XOR suppressed UPR and autophagic degradation in starved LUAD cells. Consistently, inhibition of XOR decreased the level of amino acids produced by autophagic degradation, which was accompanied with down-regulation of mTORC1 signaling. Supplementation of amino acids including glutamine, glutamate or aspartate rescued the survival of starved LUAD cells, indicating that autophagic degradation plays a key role in XOR-mediated LUAD cells survival under nutrient stress. Finally, XOR inhibitors potentiated the anti-proliferative activity of 2-deoxy-D-glucose that induced UPR and\/or autophagy in LUAD cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We found that knock-out or inhibition of XOR attenuated UPR and autophagy in starved LUAD cells, which resulted in nutrients scarcity due to blockade of the degradation of nucleosides and proteins, and finally cell death. These findings demonstrate that XOR plays a crucial role in the survival of LUAD cells, suggesting that targeting XOR is a potential strategy to improve the efficacy of drugs that are able to induce UPR and autophagy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e32a6e08-96c0-4175-bdf2-d128f3b26f50\/@C03B8ZSH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Xanthine oxidoreductase,Unfolded protein response,Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17842"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manman Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaozhen Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cen Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linghua Meng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Yet almost 20% of patients never respond to treatment and all patients eventually develop acquired resistance. <i>In vitro<\/i> palbo and abema have different affinities for CDK4\/6 and other cellular kinases, and <i>in vivo<\/i> they have different toxicity profiles. At present there are no clinically validated biomarkers to determine CDK4\/6i sensitivity or resistance. Further it is not clear if and how to choose between the CDK4\/6i for optimal outcomes. In this study, using <sup>13<\/sup>C-isotopically enriched glucose we sought to identify metabolic changes associated with palbo and abema treatment in sensitive and resistant cell lines.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> MCF-7 cells (wild-type), palbociclib resistant cells (PDR) and abemaciclib resistant cells (ABR) treated with DMSO, palbo or abema were incubated for 24hrs in DMEM supplemented with <sup>13<\/sup>C-glucose. After the incubation, cells were harvested, metabolites were extracted and analyzed via 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Biological triplicates were prepared for each condition.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In wild-type MCF-7 cells treated with palbo or abema significant metabolite changes were observed compared to DMSO. In both palbo and abema treatment a marked decrease in nucleotide metabolites was observed, which is consistent with the ability of CDK4\/6i to prevent cell cycle progression. In abema treated cells there was also significant decrease in metabolites involved in the serine-glycine pathway, which was not observed in the palbo treated cells. Palbo and abema treated cells were easily distinguishable via hierarchical clustering. PDR and ABR also had distinct metabolic profiles when they were maintained with palbo and abema, respectively or if the drugs were removed. Notably the serine-glycine pathway was increased in ABR cells but decreased in PDR cells. In PDR cells we observed an increase in glucose-1-phosphate and shift towards galactose\/glycogen metabolism.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Using cell line models we were able to demonstrate that glucose metabolism is altered in palbo and abema treatment and that resistance to each drug may activate different metabolic pathways. To the best of our knowledge this is the first direct evidence of palbo-specific and abema-specific metabolite signatures. We are assessing whether the results of these <i>in vitro<\/i> studies translate to clinical samples. If so, the altered metabolites could lead to biomarkers that correlate with response and resistance for specific CDK4\/6i. Further, we are exploring if by targeting the pathways associated with resistance, we can restore CDK4\/6i sensitivity. This could lead to novel therapeutic targets or treatment regimens that improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cda512df-3288-4ee5-bfaa-4c76cd794f7a\/@C03B8ZSH\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,CDK4\/6i resistance,Metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17843"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chandrashekhar Honrao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kanchan Sonkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina Guarducci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agostina Nardone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Srihari Raghavendra Rao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chen Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leo Rodrigues<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rinath Jeselsohn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth O'Day<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although both calcitriol and metformin ameliorated the tumoricidal actions of 5-FU, there is no report on the potential anti-cancer effects of 5-FU, calcitriol, and metformin triple therapy.<br \/><b>Objectives:<\/b> This study aimed to measure the chemotherapeutic effects of 5-FU, calcitriol, and\/or metformin single, dual, and triple treatments against CRC <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/><b>Materials and methods: <\/b>The HT29, SW480 and SW620 colon cancer cell lines were treated for 12 hours with 5-FU (50 &#181;M), calcitriol (25 &#181;M), and\/or metformin (39.8 mM) single\/dual\/triple protocols followed by measuring cell cycle and cell apoptosis by flow cytometer.

However, the mechanisms by which K-ras affects lipid metabolism remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that PLA2G2A, an enzyme that hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at <i>sn<\/i>-2 position to release polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), was up-regulated by K-ras activation and its high expression was correlated with poor survival of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Abrogation of PLA2G2A by siRNA silencing or pharmacological inhibition significantly suppressed the proliferation of K-ras-driven cancer cells, as evidenced by inhibition of cell growth and loss of colony formation capacity. Suppression of PLA2G2A could also decrease K-ras-driven PDAC cell migration. Mechanistic study showed that PLA2G2A inhibition rendered cells vulnerability to lipid peroxidation, likely due to accumulation of excessive PUFA in the membranes. Such alterations resulted in membrane damage and mitochondrial dysfunction with elevated ROS, leading to a reduction in energy production and a decrease in acetyl-CoA, which further compromised de novo lipid biosynthesis. Our study suggests that PLA2G2A-mediated cell membrane remodeling plays an important role in cell survival and proliferation in during K-ras-driven cancer, and that PLA2G2 could be a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cea712c3-784a-4150-87ce-2ef6b0d23425\/@C03B8ZSH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"K-ras,Cell membrane remodeling,PLA2G2A,Mitochondria function,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17845"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mingquan Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Expression of TS has been suggested to be determined by a variable number of tandem repeats located within the TS enhancer region (TSER). TSER genotype has been inconsistently linked to 5-FU-related adverse events, including severe grade &#8805;3 drug-related toxicity. Our recent studies demonstrated that the number of repeats within the TSER, as well as the presence or absence of a polymorphism within each repeat, was significantly associated with 5-FU toxicity in 629 patients. Our findings are consistent with a model in which the number of upstream stimulatory factor (USF1) transcription factor binding sites in the TSER, which is determined both by repeat status and genotype within each repeat, defines <i>TYMS<\/i> expression and contributions to 5-FU toxicity risk. We present an updated nomenclature that concisely and unambiguously identifies both the number of repeats and the number of USF1 binding sites. The difficulty in obtaining clear genotypes within this highly repetitive and variable region limits the ability to integrate this biomarker into predictive tests. We present methodologies for assigning TSER genotypes using conventional and high-throughput sequencing, including whole genome sequence data.

Mieap liquid droplets specifically phase separate the mitochondrial phospholipid, cardiolipin. Lipidomic analysis of cardiolipin suggests that Mieap promotes enzymatic reactions involved in cardiolipin metabolism, including biosynthesis and remodeling. Accordingly, four cardiolipin biosynthetic enzymes, TAMM41, PGS1, PTPMT1, and CRLS1, and two remodeling enzymes, PLA2G6 and TAZ, are phase-separated by Mieap liquid droplets. Mieap-deficient mice exhibit altered crista structure in mitochondria of various tissues, including brown fat, and tend to become obese. These results suggest that Mieap drives formation of membraneless organelles to compartmentalize and promote cardiolipin metabolism at the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus potentially contributing to mitochondrial quality control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c093019-079c-42a0-a07e-c6ee709bd89a\/@u03B8ZSJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 target gene,Mieap,intrinsically disordered regions,mitochondria,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17847"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Naoki Ikari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuyuki Nakamura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirofumi Arakawa<\/i><\/presenter>.

Mitochondria-bound MDM2 (mtMDM2), the fraction of MDM2 oncoprotein which is actively imported into the mitochondria, has been found to dysregulate electron transport chain (ETC) complex I function and OXPHOS. AKT is known to be a regulator of MDM2 protein stability. Given that AKT phosphorylation is commonly detected in oncogene-addicted tumours, we investigated the role of mtMDM2 and AKT in promoting TKI resistance through reprogrammed cellular metabolism. EGFR+ NSCLC [HCC827 and HCC827-GR (gefitinib-resistant)] and BRAF+ melanoma [A375 and A375-VR (vemurafenib-resistant)] cells were established via repetitive pulsed strategy. Translocation of MDM2 was examined through subcellular fractionation and Western Blotting. To investigate the role of MDM2 in mediating OXPHOS, genetic knockdown of MDM2 was performed via siRNA followed by measurement of oxygen consumption rate (Seahorse Analyzer); mRNA expression of mtDNA-encoded ETC subunits by real-time PCR (qPCR). ChIP-qPCR analysis was performed to examine the binding affinity of MDM2 and TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A) to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondrial translocation of MDM2 was predominant in TKI-sensitive cells; MDM2 silencing upregulated OXPHOS and induced mRNA expression of mtDNA-encoded ETC complex I subunits, suggesting that mtMDM2 inhibits OXPHOS. ChIP analysis revealed competitive binding of MDM2 and TFAM at the LSP region of mtDNA. Conversely, MDM2 was primarily localized the cytoplasm in TKI-resistant cells and was associated with increased OXPHOS in TKI-resistant cells. Mechanistically, both pAKT and pMDM2 (Ser166\/Ser186) were higher in TKI-resistant cells. Collectively, we describe a novel observation that OXPHOS upregulation underpinning TKI resistance in cancer cells could be mediated by AKT upregulation and MDM2 localisation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/756726a1-2b6f-495f-9587-a7dff16d6f16\/@u03B8ZSJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,MDM2,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17848"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jie Qing Eu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Ren Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayshree Hirpara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boon Cher Goh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea LA Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shazib Pervaiz<\/i><\/presenter>.

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that play essential roles in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism, redox homeostasis, and apoptotic cell death. Alterations in mitochondrial biology are associated with esophageal carcinogenesis and esophageal cancer cell response to therapy. As the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF)induces mitochondrial dysfunction, we hypothesized that DCF may inhibit esophageal carcinogenesis by affecting mitochondrial processes. In the human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell line TE11, we performed MTT assay and Annexin-V\/Propidium Iodide (PI) to evaluate the impact of DCF on proliferation and cell death, respectively. RNA sequencing and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and altered canonical pathways in DCF-treated TE11 cells. To assess metabolic function, we measured the levels of pyruvate, lactate, and ATP. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production were assessed by flow cytometry for MitoTracker red\/green and MitoSox red, respectively. Mice bearing subcutaneous syngeneic ESCC tumors were treated with DCF.DCF inhibited proliferation of TE11 in dose dependent manner with an IC50 concentration of 76.7&#181;M. By contrast, the IC50 concentration of DCF in normal esophageal keratinocytes was 876.2&#181;M, supporting selectivity of DCF for esophageal cancer cells. In TE11, 200 &#181;M DCF induced apoptosis in 60% of cells. RNA-sequencing identified that DCF significantly altered expression of3287 genes (FC &#8805; 1.50) in TE11, including the top cancer-associated genes:<i> <\/i><i>PLK1<\/i>,<i> <\/i><i>MCM2<\/i>,<i> <\/i><i>MCM3<\/i>,<i>MCM7<\/i>,<i> MCM10<\/i> and<i> SKP2<\/i>. IPA analysis revealed that DCF activated p53 signaling while inhibited Gluconeogenesis I, Glycolysis I and Oxidative Phosphorylation. DCF significantly inhibited glycolysis as demonstrated by reduction in concentrations of pyruvate (1.76-fold) and lactate (7.30-fold) and downregulation of the glycolysis- associated genes<i> PKM2<\/i>,<i> PFKM<\/i>,<i> LDHA<\/i>, and<i> PKM1<\/i>. A decreased production of ATP (5-fold) was also noted in DCF-treated TE11 cells. In addition, DCF depleted mitochondrial membrane potential (2.5-fold) and increased mitochondrial ROS production (5-fold). A reduction in ROS by mitochondrial antioxidant MitoTempo increased viability of the DCF-treated TE11 cells, indicating that ROS contributes to the anticancer activity of DCF. Consistent with antitumor activity of DCF in TE11, the drug significantly decreased the tumor volume in syngeneic ESCC tumors<i> in vivo<\/i>. Our preclinical findings indicate that DCF may limit esophageal cancer cell growth through the inhibition of mitochondrial functions, identifying a novel experimental therapeutic for ESCC. Future studies will define the precise molecular mechanisms through which DCF promotes cell death<i> in vitro<\/i> and<i> in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/847724da-55ed-435a-b03a-08be01fc5178\/@u03B8ZSJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Mitochondria,Cancer genomics,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17849"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohammad Faujul Kabir<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Karami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anbin Mu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Don-Gerard Conde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly A.

Moderate increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels can lead to cancer formation and progression. However, a disproportional increase of ROS levels changes equilibrium in cell redox status and leads to cancer cell death. Therefore, exogenous agents or antioxidant inhibitors which augment ROS generation become a potential new way to target cancer cells. We have found excessive accumulation of cellular proteins during arginine starvation causes stresses on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding machinery resulting in elevated ROS levels. In this study, we continue to examine that arginine starvation-attenuated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) translation exacerbates the high ROS level to kill the cancer cells. In addition, HO-1 translational downregulation is due to arginine starvation-induced O-GlcNAcylation of eIF2&#945; at S219, T239, and T241 residues. Loss of O-GlcNAcylation at eIF2&#945; significantly rescues arginine starvation-reduced HO-1 protein level, resulting in better recovery and migratory properties from starvation and lower ROS level. In addition, arginine starvation-induced O-GlcNAcylation of eIF2&#945; to suppress HO-1 translation is independent of its phosphorylation at S51, which is another stress-stimuli modification that regulates eIF2 involved protein translation. Arginine starvation exploits O-GlcNAcylation to antagonize eIF2&#945; phosphorylation-induced HO-1 expression. Taken together, arginine starvation is a potential anti-cancer therapy in which induced eIF2&#945; O-GlcNAcylation presents itself as a critical role for metabolic adaptation and tumor growth by dysregulating the antioxidant protein in cancer cells.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5dcd25ec-9368-480f-bea6-06d9c958be62\/@u03B8ZSJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antioxidant,O-GlcNAcylation,eIF2&#945;,HO-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17850"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yu-Wen Hung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Chang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David K.

Altered metabolism is considered a primary hallmark of tumorigenesis, as it can regulate important processes associated with proliferation, migration, and invasion. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a multifunctional endogenous phospholipid, plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis and malignant behavior of the cancer cells through G-protein coupled receptors. Although several signaling pathways have been reported as a critical mediator of gastric cancer, LPA-LPAR2 axis-mediated alteration of energy metabolism in gastric cancer progression has not been established yet. Therefore, our study focused on the molecular mechanism of LPA-LPAR2 axis-mediated alteration of mitochondrial bioenergetics during gastric cancer progression.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> TCGA database analysis was carried out to check the mRNA levels of the LPA receptors. Expression of LPA receptors was investigated in human gastric cancer samples by immunoblotting, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical analysis. We elucidated the functional effects of LPA on gastric cancer by performing ECIS proliferation, migration assay, scratch assay, and transwell invasion assay in gastric cancer cells. To confirm the involvement of the specific LPA receptor on gastric cancer progression, we treated the cells with LPA<sub>1-3 <\/sub>receptor blocker (Ki16425) and LPA<sub>2 <\/sub>receptor-specific antagonist. Following LPA receptor blockade, we analyzed the glycolytic and mitochondrial functions by measuring extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using a Seahorse XF24 analyzer.<br \/><b>Result: <\/b>Our TCGA dataset analysis, LPA ELISA, and the Western blotting result showed the presence of LPA receptors in human gastric cancer tissues, specifically LPAR2 was robustly increased (P&#60;0.001) in human gastric cancer tissue samples, and LPA level was significantly higher (P&#60;0.001), suggesting a possible role of LPA in gastric cancer. LPA treatment increased proliferation, migration, and invasion activity in AGS and NCI-N87 gastric cancer cell lines. In contrast, LPA receptor antagonist Ki16425 abrogated the LPA-induced effect. Our seahorse analysis results showed that LPA treatment increased the OCR (P&#60;0.001) and the ECAR (P&#60;0.001), whereas LPAR2 specific receptor antagonists abrogated this effect (P&#60;0.001).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Together, our results suggested that the LPA-LPAR2 axis mediates gastric cancer initiation and progression by increasing energy metabolism via oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis.

During fast tumor growth, when nutrients are scarce, lipogenesis becomes the primary source of fatty acids. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway converts saturated (SFAs) into unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) and is highly expressed in OC. The goal of this study was to determine how the balance between SFAs and UFAs tightly controlled by SCD, regulates OC cell survival and tumorigenicity.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> SCD was knocked down by shRNA or inhibited by using the small molecule CAY10566 and global effects on the lipidome and transcriptome were examined by targeted and untargeted lipidomics, stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SRS), and RNA sequencing. In OC cells in which SCD was blocked or knocked down, the effects of exogenous SFAs and UFAs on cell survival and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway were assessed by using annexin V staining, XBP1 splicing assay and Western blotting of PERK\/eIF2&#945;\/ATF4. Tumorigenicity was assessed by using an intraperitoneal (i.p.) xenograft model in nude mice.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RNA-seq analysis of SCD knockdown cells cultured under low serum conditions revealed activation of ER stress response pathways.

Activation of IRE1&#945;\/XBP1 and PERK\/eIF2&#945;\/ATF4 axes was observed in cells accumulating SFAs. Stiff and disorganized ER membrane was detected by electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Annexin V staining demonstrated apoptosis of OC cells under long-term mild ER stress or short-time severe ER stress induced by increased levels of SFAs. ER stress and apoptosis were rescued by addition of UFAs.

Although intracellular concentrations of <i>N<\/i><sup>8<\/sup>-AcSpd are low, extracellular sources can be abundant, particularly in the colonic lumen. Extracellular polyamines, including those from the diet and microbiota, can support tumor growth both locally and at distant sites. However, the contribution of <i>N<\/i><sup>8<\/sup>-AcSpd is unknown. We hypothesized that HDAC10, by converting <i>N<\/i><sup>8<\/sup>-AcSpd to spermidine, may provide a source of this growth-supporting polyamine in circumstances of reduced polyamine biosynthesis, such as in polyamine-targeting, anticancer therapies. Inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis, such as difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), inhibit tumor growth but with compensatory uptake of extracellular polyamines that have limited their clinical success. Combining DFMO with inhibitors of polyamine uptake have improved the antitumor response. However, acetylated polyamines may use different transport machinery than the parent molecules. The current study uses CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated HDAC10-knockout cell lines and recently developed, selective HDAC10 inhibitors to investigate the contribution of HDAC10 in maintaining tumor cell proliferation. Inhibition of cell growth by DFMO-associated polyamine depletion is successfully rescued by the provision of physiological concentrations of exogenous <i>N<\/i><sup>8<\/sup>-AcSpd, which is converted to spermidine and spermine, only in cell lines with HDAC10 activity. Loss of HDAC10 prevents both restoration of polyamine levels and growth rescue, implicating HDAC10 in supporting polyamine-associated tumor growth. These data suggest the utility of HDAC10-specific inhibitors as an antitumor strategy that may have particular value in improving the response to polyamine-blocking therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/52f97991-e7fc-408f-8935-b520a41849a6\/@u03B8ZSJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polyamines,HDAC10,Colon cancer,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18784"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tracy Murray Stewart<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raphael R.

Hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation and utilization are involved in cancer proliferation and therapy resistance, making modulation of glycogen metabolism of therapeutic interest. Therefore, we studied expression of glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1, the key regulator of glycogen synthesis) and glycogen stores in publicly available expression data and human breast tumors including TNBC. Also, we studied downregulation of GYS1 in preclinical breast cancer models, focusing on TNBC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: GYS1 mRNA expression and correlations with survival per clinical subtype were assessed in the METABRIC dataset. A tissue micro-array was constructed from primary tumors of 396 breast cancer patients with long-term follow-up, including normal breast control tissue. Triplicate tissue cores were stained immunohistochemically for GYS1, glycogen and the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase 9, and with periodic acid-Schiff staining for glycogen. In four TNBC cell lines and an MDA-MB-231 xenograft model, GYS1 protein expression, glycogen content and cell proliferation in normoxia and hypoxia were evaluated +\/- GYS1 knockdown by siRNA or shRNA. Sensitivity of shGYS1 cell lines to drugs targeting mitochondria was tested.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: In the METABRIC dataset (n = 1904), overexpression of GYS1 mRNA was associated with poor overall survival (HR 1.20 [95% CI 1.05 - 1.38]), which was mainly driven by the TNBC patients (n = 299, HR 1.52 [95% CI 1.09 - 2.14]). Immunohistochemically, most primary breast tumors had elevated GYS1 levels and glycogen content compared to normal breast tissue, with subtype specific analyses ongoing. In all breast cancer cell lines, hypoxia induced GYS1 protein expression and increased glycogen content. Acute siRNA-mediated GYS1 knockdown decreased proliferation of (TN)BC cell lines and MDA-MB-231 spheroids in both hypoxia and normoxia. shGYS1 MDA-MB-231 cells had decreased glycogen levels and shGYS1 MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth was impaired, especially in the first six weeks after inoculation. In control xenografts, immunohistochemical GYS1 expression was most pronounced adjacent to the necrotic tumor core, whereas shGYS1 xenografts lacked GYS1 expression. Finally, shGYS1 MDA-MB-231 cells were more sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial protein homeostasis, suggesting a potential synergistic approach to overcome eventual metabolic adaptation.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: GYS1 is overexpressed in primary breast tumors and high mRNA levels correlate with poor survival in TNBC. GYS1 downregulation impairs TNBC proliferation in vitro and in vivo, highlighting glycogen synthesis as potential novel therapeutic target in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86f365a1-24b3-4092-aa4e-a5dd46730b6c\/@v03B8ZSK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Glycogen,Metabolism,GYS1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18785"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ellen C.

The involution process is characterized by mammary tissue remodeling, including adipocyte repopulation and re-differentiation fueled by metabolic rewiring. Our mouse model mimicking short-term breast feeding that leads to abrupt involution (AI) revealed a chronic inflammatory state in the mammary gland (MG)<i><sup>1<\/sup><\/i>. As metabolic dysfunction is linked to increased BC risk, we sought to elucidate the effects of AI and gradual involution (GI) on MG energy metabolism and associated oxidative stress. In addition, we evaluated the impact of AI and GI on whole body glucose metabolism and insulin response\/resistance.<br \/>Methods: FVB\/n mice (8week old) were paired for breeding. At partum, dams were randomized to AI or GI cohort and standardized to 6 pups per dam. AI mice had pups removed on postpartum day 7 (d7) to mimic short-term breastfeeding. GI mice had 3 pups removed on day 28 and 31 each to mimic gradual weaning. MGs were harvested on d28, 56, and 120 postpartum. Prior to harvest, mice underwent an echoMRI and insulin tolerance test (ITT). At harvest, mice were fasted for 4 hours, and blood was collected for serum insulin measurement using Ultra-Sensitive Insulin ELISA. Lipid peroxidation (MDA) and DNA adduct formation (8-OHdG), which represent chronic oxidative stress, were measured in MG by ELISA. Whole MG RNA were subjected to affymetrix followed by gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) and qPCR for target validation. MGs were also subjected to untargeted metabolomics analysis and Mitofuel flex assay to assess substrate dependence by Seahorse Bioanalyzer.<br \/>Results: GSEA and qPCR revealed enrichment of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathways in AI MGs at d28, further validated by expression of genes (<i>PGC-1&#945;<\/i>, <i>Cpt-2<\/i>, <i>Srebp1c<\/i>, and <i>Chrebp<\/i>). Metabolites associated with FAO were enriched in AI MGs at d28 and 56. Mitofuel flex assay indicated a significantly higher dependence on FAO in AI MGs. On d56, fasted blood glucose was significantly higher in AI mice with serum insulin and HOMA-IR trending to be higher than in GI mice. Level of 8-OHdG was elevated in AI MGs at d120. AI mice trended to be heavier, have greater body fat, and lower lean mass than GI Mice at d120. Body weight and percent body fat on d120 were positively correlated to MDA concentration in the mammary gland.<br \/>Conclusion: Our mouse models of AI and GI revealed early MG specific metabolic shift towards increased FAO and OXPHOS that persists over time in AI glands. Similarly, increased oxidative stress and its association with adiposity at d120 indicates continued effect of AI. This change in adiposity, altered systemic glucose metabolism and metabolic shift seen in AI mice may contribute to the higher risk of breast cancer. 1. 1.

The association between hair dye use and the development of cancer has been a research focus, including for breast, prostate, and bladder cancer, yet biological mechanisms have not been established. In this first examination of metabolomic response to hair dye exposure, we compared the serum metabolite profiles of male hair dye users and nonusers to identify differences related to biological mechanisms relevant to how exposure may influence cancer risk. The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study was a randomized, controlled cancer prevention trial of vitamin supplementation that enrolled 50&#8211;69-year-old Finnish male smokers of whom 75 hair dye users and 125 nonusers were studied. Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to assay baseline serum samples, and the difference in log-transformed, batch-normalized metabolite signals between the exposed and unexposed men was estimated using linear regression, adjusting for age, body mass index, and smoking. We measured 1,401 metabolites, of which 11 compounds, including 4 amino acids and 3 xenobiotics, differed significantly between the two groups after correction for multiple comparisons (FDR&#60;0.1). Redox-related glutathione metabolism was heavily represented, including cysteineglutathione disulfide which showed the strongest association with hair dye use (effect size (&#946;) = -0.685; p&#60;0.0001), along with oxidized cysteine-glycine (&#946; = -0.325; p&#60;0.0001) and several compounds relevant to antioxidation\/ROS pathways. Metabolites previously associated with prostate cancer risk also differed significantly between hair dye user and non-users. Our findings point to biological mechanisms through which exposure to hair dyes may impact risk of prostate and other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f2ed6fa9-187e-4839-a675-4e7fe96ed25b\/@v03B8ZSK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Biomarkers,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18788"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jungeun Lim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiaqi Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie J.

Nicotine, the addictive and non-carcinogenic smoke component, influences various brain cells and the immune system. However, little is known how long-term use of nicotine affects clinical outcomes in patients with brain metastasis. To address this question, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 810 lung cancer patients with smoking history and assessed brain metastasis. We found that lung cancer patients of current smokers have significantly higher brain metastatic incidence compared to the never-smokers. Immune profiling of the brain metastatic lesions among smokers showed predominant infiltration of neutrophils compared to never-smokers. Notably, mice pre-exposed to nicotine showed a significantly increased number of neutrophils in the brains even before implantation of cancer cells (pre-metastatic niche), and their numbers progressively increased during the metastatic stage. Neutrophil depletion during metastatic colonization caused a remarkable decrease in brain metastasis. Furthermore, we found that chronic exposure of nicotine recruited STAT3-activated N2-neutrophils that secreted exosomal miR-4466 in the brain. This pre-metastatic niche promoted stemness and metabolic switching via SKI\/SOX2\/CPT1A axis in the tumor cells thereby enabling brain metastasis. Importantly, exosomal miR-4466 levels were found to be elevated in serum\/urine of cancer-free subjects with a smoking history and promote tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>, suggesting that exosomal miR-4466 may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for predicting increased risk of metastatic disease among smoker(s). Our findings suggest a novel pro-metastatic role of nicotine-induced N2-neutrophils in the progression of brain metastasis. We also demonstrated that inhibiting nicotine-induced STAT3-mediated neutrophil polarization effectively abrogated brain metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our finding for the first time provides compelling evidence related to the mechanism(s) of neutrophil-mediated brain metastasis that arises from nicotine use. Our results also identified a potential prognostic biomarker for the onset of metastasis as a risk-reduction measure in lung cancer patients and implicated the risk of using nicotine gateway for smoking cessation in cancer patients with a smoking history.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fa34d751-980f-4a73-a00f-19ae07eff0de\/@v03B8ZSK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nicotine,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Metabolism,Brain metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18789"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Abhishek Tyagi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shih-Ying Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sambad Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerui Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravindra Deshpande<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kounosuke Watabe<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is characterized by loss of skeletal muscle (SM) tissue with or without adipose tissue loss. This analysis reports on the characteristics and outcomes of patients recruited into the prospective TRACERx study, who presented with or subsequently developed features of CC during follow-up.<br \/><b>Approach: <\/b>Using longitudinal CT imaging, total, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (TAT, SAT, VAT) and SM volumes were manually quantified at the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> lumbar vertebrae level. Body weight was measured every 3-6 months and grouped according to BMI-adjusted weight loss grades. Multi-region primary tumour tissue was collected at the time of surgical resection and subjected to whole exome and RNA sequencing.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Patients in the TRACERx 421 cohort who presented with low SAT volume at diagnosis, represented by the lower 20% percentile of the cohort, had significantly shorter lung-cancer specific survival (LCSS) and overall survival (OS) compared with patients in the 80% percentile (3-y LCSS 61% vs 81%, p&#60;0.001; 3-y OS 57% vs 69%, p=0.02). Patients presenting with low VAT had a significantly shorter LCSS (3-y-LCSS 66% vs 79%, p=0.01), but not OS (3-y OS 60% vs 69%). Low SM volume was not associated with LCSS or OS. However, loss of SM volume of &#8805;20% between diagnosis and disease relapse was associated with significantly reduced LCSS and OS (3-y LCSS 30% vs 49%, p=0.02; 3-y OS 26% vs 45%, p=0.03). Based on a multivariable model, low SAT volume at diagnosis and SM loss were independent prognostic factors for LCSS, but not OS. In addition, BMI-adjusted weight loss was associated with shorter OS and LCSS (3-y OS 7% for patients with weight loss grade 4 vs 54% in patients with stable weight, p&#60;0.001 [LCSS 8% vs 61%, p&#60;0.001]). Preliminary genomic data from patients with disease recurrence and with (n=47) or without (n=107) features of CC, defined as SAT or muscle loss &#62;20% or weight loss grade 4, demonstrated distinct copy number alteration and differential gene expression profiles.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In patients with early-stage NSCLC, both altered body composition and weight loss in keeping with CC was associated with poor survival outcomes. In particular, low SAT volume at diagnosis and loss of SM between diagnosis and relapse were independent prognostic factors for LCSS. Ongoing analyses in TRACERx will continue to investigate the potential tumour-intrinsic mediators of CC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/36eaf94c-4578-4dfd-bfdf-46951a2d32a2\/@v03B8ZSK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,Body mass index,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18790"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Othman Al-Sawaf<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcin Skrzypski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jakob Weiss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takahiro Karasaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolai Juul Birkbak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco Zambrana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Frankell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas B.

Current standard of care includes combination chemotherapies; however, the majority of patients fail to respond to these treatments. Despite significant advances in our understanding of PDAC biology, it remains unclear what biological processes drives the drug resistance observed in most PDAC cases. Contributing to our limited understanding of this problem, <i>in vitro<\/i> models of PDAC fail to recapitulate <i>in vivo<\/i> drug resistance, suggesting the tumor microenvironment is a critical regulator.A defining feature of PDAC tumors is an abnormal nutrient environment, which may carry important biological cues driving many of the undesirable cell behaviors related to disease progression. Using a novel medium formulation that mimics the nutrient conditions observed within PDAC tumors (TIFM), we find that PDAC cells cultured in TIFM become highly resistant to common chemotherapeutic agents, better recapitulating the <i>in vivo<\/i> drug resistance phenotype than standard cultures. Several of these agents engage with their intended target in TIFM cultured cells, discouraging the idea that drug resistance is primarily mediated by drug efflux. However, TIFM cultured cells display reduced apoptotic priming, enabling their survival to drug exposure. Drug resistance enabled by TIFM nutrients is not immediately reversible with standard culture and can be inherited over multiple cell generations. Consistent with this, we find that TIFM nutrient conditions results in significant alterations to the epigenetic landscape of pancreatic cancer cells, rewiring expression of genes that may function as critical regulators of cell survival in PDAC. Ultimately, the work from this project will help elucidate how poor nutrient perfusion within solid tumors regulates cell survival processes and may lead towards better treatment options for PDAC patients beyond combination chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58fa2c2c-05b3-4657-aa5f-791ca81dcd5d\/@v03B8ZSK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Drug resistance,Pancreatic cancer,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18791"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Colin Sheehan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Martin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Croley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua McKeever<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anika Thomas-Toth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Jonker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James LaBelle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Koh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Muir<\/i><\/presenter>.

PDAC is characterized by an altered\/abnormal nutrient tumormicroenvironment (TME)<sup>2<\/sup>, and cancer cells must adapt metabolically, which exposes potentialtherapeutic targetable vulnerabilities. Therefore, we seek to identify metabolic pathways thatallow PDAC adaptation to such abnormal TME. The integrated stress response (ISR) is anintracellular stress response pathway that senses diverse stressors, and subsequently initiatesdownstream stress adaptations<sup>3<\/sup>. We find both murine and human PDAC have elevatedexpression of ATF4, the most well-characterized ISR effector, compared to paired healthypancreas by immunohistochemistry staining. Further, I find the ISR is activated and critical forPDAC survival\/proliferation upon physiological PDAC TME nutrient stress. What is triggering theISR activation in PDAC? Through a variety of studies, I determined that it was the amino acidstress, specifically the depletion of arginine and asparagine, that activated the ISR upstreamkinase GCN2, which is responsible for ATF4 upregulation upon PDAC TME nutritional stress.Through CRISPR-based competition assays, I determined that ATF4 activity was critical forPDAC cells to cope with the depletion of arginine and asparagine, and ATF4 activity wasdispensable when these two amino acids were supplied even though cultured in PDACphysiological TME conditions. Currently, I am seeking to validate these findings in murine PDACmodels, and to determine if ATF4 or GCN2 could be relevant therapeutic targets, using an<i> in<\/i><i>vivo<\/i> tumor competition assay that I am developing. Altogether, I find the ISR is active in PDACboth<i> ex vivo<\/i> and<i> in vivo<\/i>, and suggest that the ISR is critical for PDAC survival\/proliferation byallowing adaptation to abnormal PDAC amino acid TME. This work suggests that the ISR is anovel therapeutic target for PDAC treatment, which ultimately can benefit PDAC patients.<br \/><b>References: <\/b>1.

Thus, depleting NAD levels in tumor cells through interference with their NAD-biosynthetic machinery has been proposed as a promising anticancer strategy. Several pathways contribute to NAD production in mammals, such as the de novo and the Preiss-Handler (PH) pathways, which generate NAD from tryptophan and from nicotinic acid, respectively. In addition, the NAD salvage pathway, which utilizes nicotinamide as a substrate, is also a major NAD-producing route and its rate-limiting enzyme, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), is commonly overexpressed in a multitude of human cancers. Over the past two decades, several potent NAMPT inhibitors have been developed, such as FK866. However, their clinical efficacy has proven limited, suggesting that the other NAD-producing routes are frequently also active in cancer cells and are responsible for causing resistance to NAMPT inhibitors. Recently, we have shown nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (NAPRT), the key enzyme in the PH pathway, to play an important role in NAD metabolism in cancer cells. We demonstrated that NAPRT is amplified and overexpressed in several types of solid tumors and that its expression is a critical determinant of cancer cell susceptibility to NAMPT inhibitors. Although several NAPRT inhibitors have been reported, including 2-hydroxy nicotinic acid (2-HNA), their low potency and\/or poor solubility limit their clinical applicability. To identify new NAPRT inhibitors with enhanced pharmacological profiles, we performed a high-throughput molecular docking screen, taking advantage of the availability of NAPRT crystal structure. The first 500 hits were visually inspected to prioritize compounds that reproduced, at least in part, the putative binding mode of known substrates and inhibitors and complied with simple physicochemical rules such as Lipinski&#8217;s rule of five. In addition, several 2-HNA analogs were selected. Altogether, this led to a final list of 50 compounds that were tested in vitro. We show that four compounds from this list were able to sensitize NAPRT-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells to FK866, resulting in a more significant reduction in intracellular NAD levels, as well as in a much more pronounced cytotoxicity as compared to FK866 alone. The inhibitory constant (Ki) of the new NAPRT inhibitors was found to be in the micromolar range. In conclusion, in silico molecular docking screens are a promising approach to identify new NAPRT inhibitors with anticancer effects.<br \/><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/38f95564-dd96-41c3-b6e1-63c1f9342400\/@v03B8ZSK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,NAPRT inhibitors,In silico drug design,NAD ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20803"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Moustafa Ghanem<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amr Khalifa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Caffa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aimable Nahimana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michel Duchosal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Del Rio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santina Bruzzone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Piancente<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessio Nencioni<\/i><\/presenter>.

The syndrome induces significant weight loss and leads to morbidity, intolerance to chemotherapy, and mortality. While performing metabolic characterization of the brain and plasma of mice with a cachexia-inducing human pancreatic cancer xenograft we identified significant changes in glutamine metabolism [1] that led us to investigate the effects of altering tumor glutamine metabolism on weight loss. We genetically engineered cachexia inducing Pa04C cells to express shRNA downregulating the glutamine transporter SLC1A5. Tumors derived from Pa04C cells with downregulated SLC1A5 (CSh cells and tumors) exhibited significantly delayed tumor growth compared to empty vector (EV) or wild type (WT) tumors, but escaped growth delay approximately 60 days after inoculation, although SLC1A5 mRNA and protein remained significantly downregulated. Despite tumor growth, mouse weight reduction was significantly attenuated at matched EV and CSh tumor volumes. We next sought to investigate if tumors derived from cells isolated from escaped CSh tumor (TSh cells and tumors) continued to exhibit growth delay and attenuated weight loss when re-inoculated in mice. Quantitative transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq was performed to determine differentially expressed genes in CSh and TSh cells compared to EV cells. Method: EV, CSh or TSh cells were inoculated subcutaneously in male mice. Tumor volumes and weights of tumor bearing mice were recorded until tumors were harvested at ~ 500 mm<sup>3<\/sup> for molecular characterization. RNA was isolated in triplicate from EV, CSh and TSh cells. Transcriptomic analysis was performed by RNA sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 PE150 platform. All bioinformatics analysis was performed with assistance from the NOVOGENE informatics group. Results: Tumors derived from TSh cells did not exhibit any growth delay unlike tumors derived from CSh cells. SLC1A5 expression remained downregulated in TSh cells and tumors. Despite the loss of growth delay, mice with TSh tumors continued to exhibit attenuated weight loss identifying, suggesting the glutamine transporter as a potential treatment strategy to reduce cachexia. Transcriptomic analysis allowed us to identify the adaptive changes that occurred in CSh tumors that allowed these tumors to escape growth delay despite SLC1A5 downregulation. Transcriptomic differences between TSh and CSh cells were primarily in pathways related to amino acid metabolism, inflammation and the extracellular matrix. These transcriptomic differences allow the identification of novel targets that can be used in combination with glutamine transporter downregulation to arrest the growth of pancreatic cancer cells <i>in vivo<\/i>.

As TNBC has limited targeted therapy options, chemotherapies remain the mainstay treatment. Nearly 50% of TNBC patients harbor substantial residual cancer following chemotherapy, leading to high rates of recurrence. Using longitudinal biopsies from orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and TNBC patients, we found residual tumors following chemotherapy transitioned to a unique metabolic state characterized by high mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos). This state was transient, with tumors reverting to their baseline glycolysis-high phenotype when they were allowed to regrow in the absence of treatment. Using genomic sequencing and cellular barcode-mediated clonal tracking, we found this mechanism of chemoresistance arose in the absence of clonal selection, suggesting chemotherapy induced plastic (<i>i.e., <\/i>non-genomic) programs enabling cell survival following treatment. Blocking oxphos with an inhibitor of electron transport chain Complex I (IACS010759; PMID:29892070) was significantly more efficacious against residual than pre-treated tumors (PMID:30996079), providing evidence that dynamic metabolic phenotypes represent targetable therapeutic vulnerabilities for TNBC. Using longitudinal samples collected from PDX models undergoing treatments with anthracyclines, platinums, and\/or taxanes, we visualized and quantified mitochondrial structure in two- and three-dimensions by electron microscopy. These studies revealed extensive alteration of mitochondrial structure and number in residual tumor cells, and these changes reverted when residual tumors were allowed to regrow in the absence of treatment. We then administered chemotherapeutics to human TNBC cells, revealing that DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics increased mitochondrial elongation, but microtubule poisons increased mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings suggested chemotherapeutics may alter the dynamics of mitochondrial fission and fusion in TNBC cells. These structural changes were accompanied by increased or decreased oxphos rates, glucose-driven TCA cycle flux, and mitochondrial content, respectively. Driving mitochondrial fusion by genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 increased oxphos and chemoresistance, whereas driving mitochondrial fission by genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the mitochondrial fusion protein Opa1 decreased oxphos and chemoresistance. These findings provide evidence that modulating mitochondrial fission and fusion may be a promising strategy to overcome metabolic states contributing to chemoresistance in TNBC. Our ongoing investigations are aimed at rational targeted therapies and scheduling approaches to overcome chemoresistance in <i>in vivo<\/i> models of TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Chemoresistance,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21559"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lily Baek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junegoo Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariah J.

Gemcitabine is a type of chemotherapy drug which commonly used to treat PDAC, however, the rapid acquisition of resistance to gemcitabine treatment has been observed in many of PDAC patients. The miRNA-producing enzymes Dicer is crucial for the maturation of miRNAs, and we found previously that ERK\/Sp1 signaling transactivate both gene and protein expressions of <i>Dicer, <\/i>leading an acquisition of gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In this study, we further identified that phosphomimetic S1016E of Dicer may regulate miRNAs maturation, resulting an imbalance of glutaminase (<i>GLS<\/i>) and glutamine synthetase (<i>GS\/GLUL<\/i>). Metabolism analysis revealed that gemcitabine-resistant PANC-1 (PANC-1\/GEM) cells have high glutamine dependence and <i>GLS\/GLUL<\/i> ratio. Our study suggests that phosphomimetic Dicer S1016E plays a critical role in glutamine metabolism reprogramming and gemcitabine resistance of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Gemcitabine,Glutamine metabolism,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21567"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ching-Feng Chiu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Min Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Shiuan Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Ying Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tung-Wei Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yen-Hao Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsin-An Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

To explore novel vulnerabilities of ALK TKI-resistant cancer cells, we focused on their distinct metabolic pathways for growth and survival.<br \/>Experimental Design: To investigate metabolic pathways in resistance mechanisms, we generated ALK-TKIs -acquired-resistant <i>in vitro\/vivo<\/i> models. We screened metabolite mechanisms using metabolite assay kit, Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer, real-time PCR, western blot, RNA-seq in resistant models.<br \/>Results: Through an integrated transcriptomic and metabolic assay screening approach, we identified the enhanced reliance on glutamine metabolism in target-off ALK-TKIs-resistant cells. Specifically, resistant cells were characterized by upregulation of glutaminase 1 (GLS1), a mitochondrial enzyme hydrolyzing glutamine into glutamate, simultaneously with downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). We demonstrated that this metabolic state intensively accelerates glutaminolysis and subsequent mitochondrial glutamine-derived aspartate synthesis, resulting in TKI resistance by reinforcing antioxidant capacity with increase of NADPH and glutathione. Mechanistically, GLS1 inhibition elicited a marked reduction of cell growth with increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in resistant cells, which was restored by supplementation of exogenous aspartate. The antitumor activity of GLS1 inhibition against resistant tumor cells was further validated in <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and <i>EML4-ALK<\/i> transgenic mice. More importantly, glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 treatment in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-resistant EML4-ALK transgenic mice.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings highlight a new metabolic vulnerability of ALK-TKIs resistant tumors and provide a rationale for targeting GLS1 as a potential treatment option to overcome ALK-TKIs resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e949b3db-6c3f-4722-a920-67b597ca5a58\/@w03B8ZSL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,ALK,Resistance,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20098"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>You Won Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hun Mi Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Yeon Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun Ji Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyoung-Ho Pyo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Hwan Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngseon Byeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seong Gu Heo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Min Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hee Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chang Gon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hye Ryun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mi Ran Yun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byoung Chul Cho<\/i><\/presenter>.
