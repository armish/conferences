[{"Abstract":"Standard care of lung cancer treatment has shifted away from non-specific, cytotoxic chemotherapy in favor of targeted therapies based on genetic mutations within tumors. In 2014, somatic mutations in the small GTPase <i>RIT1<\/i> (<i>Ras-like in all tissues<\/i>) were discovered as oncogenic drivers of lung adenocarcinoma. Thousands of patients per year are diagnosed with <i>RIT1<\/i>-driven cancer, but treatment options are limited. A targeted therapy for <i>RIT1<\/i>-driven tumors would address a major unmet clinical need. Little is known about how <i>RIT1<\/i> drives cellular transformation. To genetically dissect RIT1 function, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9 screen in isogenic PC9 lung adenocarcinoma cells. This screen took advantage of the observation that <i>RIT1<\/i>-mutant cells are resistant to EGFR inhibition. We leveraged this drug resistance phenotype to identify genetic dependencies (gene knockouts that are detrimental to cell growth) and cooperating factors (gene knockouts that are beneficial to cell growth) in <i>RIT1<\/i>-mutant cells. From this screen, we found that one of the top essential genes was the deubiquitinase <i>USP9X<\/i>. This is intriguing given that the protein abundance of RIT1 is known to be important for its function. Therefore, we sought out to test the hypothesis that USP9X regulates RIT1 abundance and that inhibition of USP9X could be an effective therapeutic strategy for abrogating <i>RIT1<\/i>-driven tumor growth. Our model suggests that USP9X promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of RIT1. To test this, we assessed RIT1 abundance in the context of <i>USP9X<\/i> knockout (KO). We found that RIT1 protein abundance was decreased in <i>USP9X<\/i> KO PC9 cells compared to parental cells. Furthermore, cycloheximide (CHX)-chase experiments revealed that RIT1 stability was decreased in <i>USP9X<\/i> KO cells, and RIT1 degraded faster than in parental cells. The average half-life of RIT1 in <i>USP9X<\/i> KO cells was 3.4 hrs while the average half-life in parental PC9 cells was 12.3 hrs (95% CI = -12.5 to -5.4 hrs). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) rescued RIT1 degradation by 99% in parental cells and 190% in <i>USP9X<\/i> KO cells (95% CI = 57 to 126%). In addition to assessing protein abundance and stability, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in RIT1-expressing HEK293T cells and found that RIT1 and USP9X physically interact. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that RIT1 is a substrate of USP9X. In addition to providing better insight on the protein regulation of RIT1, this work has crucial therapeutic implications. The protein abundance of RIT1 is important for its function, and our model suggests that USP9X inhibition could be an effective means of reducing RIT1 protein abundance and abrogating tumor growth. Overall, this work is poised to significantly impact the field of RIT1 biology and address a major unmet clinical need for the treatment of <i>RIT1<\/i>-driven diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/84b664eb-850d-4d62-bb62-26537a5e95ca\/@x03B8ZHW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"GTPase,CRISPR\/Cas9,Ubiquitination,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13184"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda K.

One of the most aggressive subtypes of breast cancer is the triple negative form, which account for the 10-15% of breast cancer cases. Due to its complex heterogeneity triple negative breast cancer available treatments are limited, being chemotherapy in the first line of use. Despite advances in the search for new treatments, there is still a lack of effective therapies, being the metastatic disease the principal cause of breast cancer mortality. Therefore, it is critical to develop a new and effective strategies to inhibit metastasis. The Rho GTPase Rac has been identified as a promising target for anti-metastatic cancer therapy as it has been shown to play key roles in metastatic cancer cells dynamics as: cellular adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival and invasion. To this extent, in an effort to find a compound with increased Rac inhibitory capacity our group developed Ehop-016 derivatives HV-107 and HV-118. Previously we have reported HV-107 and HV-118 to affect cell viability promoting a G<sub>2<\/sub>-M cell cycle arrest with a sub-G1 population indicative of cell death in MDA-MB-231. Also, an increase of caspases activity validating apoptosis as a mechanism of cell death was shown. In addition, a decrease in tumor growth and metastasis by ~35 to 40% in an <i>in vivo<\/i> study using HV-118 at 1 mg\/kg body weightwas also reported. Currently, through pulldown assays we have showed HV-107 and HV-118 to inhibit Rac activity at~500-2000 nM and 10 nM respectively in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. Using trypan blue excision assay HV-107(<u>&#62;<\/u>500 nM) and HV-118(<u>&#62;<\/u>50 nM) were shown to affect cell viability promoting a G<sub>2<\/sub>-M cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-468. We also demonstrated HV-107 and HV-118 to inhibit the direct downstream effector of Rac, PAK at <u>&#62;<\/u>500 nM(HV-107) and <u>&#62;<\/u>50 nM(HV-118) in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, HV-107 was also shown to increase Rho activity at concentrations significantly higher than the effective for Rac inhibition. Rho activity up-regulation has been reported to negatively affect migration of cancerous cells. Finally, we tested HV-107 in a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. A decrease of ~ 40% in liver metastasis was shown for mice treated with 5 mg\/kg BW HV-107. Taken together, our results indicate HV-107 and HV-118 are approximately 4-100 times more efficient than the parent compound Ehop-016 and have potential as anti-breast cancer metastasis therapeutics.<br \/>This study is supported by NIH Grant 1SC1GM122691, and PRINBRE P20GM103475 from NIGMS of the NIH to GVC","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec0bb840-98f3-4d26-8fe9-d315914c726f\/@x03B8ZHW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Rac,Inhibitor,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13186"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Grace Enid Velez Crespo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eliud Hernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suranganie Dharmawardhane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cornelis Vlaar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linnette Castillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lilia Kucheryavykh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our laboratory has previously reported a mutant-KRAS-proximal complex at the plasma membrane that consists of tumor-suppressor Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Sprouty Related EVH1 Domain Containing 2 (SPRED2), and Ribosomal S6 Kinase 1 (RSK1). This complex mechanistically suppresses WT KRAS signaling via RSK1, a suppression which is then relieved upon mutant KRAS inhibition, ultimately promoting adaptive resistance for PDAC cells under these conditions. These data highlighted a potential paradoxical role for two canonical tumor-suppressors, NF1 and SPRED2, as promoters of PDAC tumorigenesis when mutant KRAS is inhibited. We find that knockout of NF1 in PDAC organoids induces a substantial growth defect <i>in vivo<\/i>, and our preliminary data indicates that SPRED2 knockout PDAC cells have reduced proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i>. Moreover, both SPRED2 and NF1 KO promotes a diminished migratory phenotype <i>in vitro<\/i>. Given NF1's well-established role as a tumor-suppressor, our observations of decreased tumorigenic properties upon NF1 deletion are unexpected. We hypothesize that NF1 and Spred2 promote tumorigenesis via recruitment of RSK1 to the plasma membrane, inducing the phosphorylation of putative substrates to stimulate a pro-migratory cellular behavior. Our work suggests the existence of a unique RSK1 program localized at the plasma membrane by mutant KRAS, providing a new facet of oncogenesis to investigate for fundamental understanding and potential therapeutic opportunities.<b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/56999d3b-c1c3-4af9-be87-3418ee830dde\/@x03B8ZHW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,KRAS,Organoids,Tumor suppressor gene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13187"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sunny Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jonathan P.

RAS is a small GTPase cycling between GTP-bound &#8216;ON&#8217; state and GDP-bound &#8216;OFF&#8217; state. KRAS oncoproteins cycle between these states via hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange with the aid of GAPs, including NF1, and GEFs. Given the &#8217;inactive state&#8217; inhibition of recently developed KRAS G12C inhibitors on the GDP-bound state, this has highlighted the continued reliance of KRAS-mutants upon cycling, and the potential for mutants to retain dependence upon upstream influences, including NF1, for pathogenicity.<br \/>Methods: 474 patients with advanced RAS- and\/or NF1-mutant NSCLC were retrospectively identified from four tertiary cancer centers between 2008 -2021. DNA from archival FFPE samples, serum or combination underwent targeted NGS panels to identify mutations. Molecular, clinical, pathological and treatment outcome data were collected. Online resources including cBioPortal and Project Achilles were used to assess the functional role of any findings.<br \/>Results: KRAS mutations were identified in 416\/474 patients and NF1-mutations in 63\/474 patients, eight of whom harbored two NF1-mutations. 24\/63 (38%) of NF1-mutant cancers had a concomitant KRAS-mutation. We identified that KRAS G13D was more prevalent in NF1 mutant cancers vs. NF1 wildtype (NF1 MT: 6\/24, 25%; vs. NF1 WT: 4\/281, 1.4%; p&#60;0.0001). KRAS G12C was identified in 11\/24 (45.8%) of the double mutants vs. 109\/282 (38.7%) of the NF1 WT patients (p=0.52). Those with G13D\/NF1 co-mutation had a predicted pathogenic NF1-mutation in 5\/6 (83%) of cases. Functional analysis of NF1 KO in G13D mutant lung cancer cell lines identified that NF1 was more essential in G13D mutant cell lines, with median Chronos score -0.26 G13D vs. -0.04 G12C (p=0.02). mRNA expression data identified a range of mRNA expression Z-scores relative to all samples for NF1-mutant cancers, ranging from lowest expression at -4.54 to +1.63, median -0.51. A higher mRNA expression was identified for NF1 missense mutations of unknown significance compared to truncating mutations with likely pathogenic, loss of function.<br \/>Conclusions: These results highlight the co-mutational landscape of KRAS G13D with NF1 in NSCLC, suggesting functional importance conferred by NF1 loss, and highlight NF1 mutations as an additional pathogenic even when combined with KRAS mutation. The genomic landscape of KRAS and NF1 mutant NSCLC will be explored further through Whole Genome Sequencing data from the 100,000 Genomes Project (Genomics England).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c4c7f701-fa11-425e-803c-1d259672d059\/@x03B8ZHW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,NSCLC,GTPase activating protein,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13188"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Helen M.

Overexpression and mutations of EGFR are found in up to 30% of solid tumors and correlate with a poor prognosis. Although it is known that EGFR-mediated NF-&#954;B activation is involved in tumor development, the signaling axis is not well elucidated. Here, we found that plakophilin 2 (PKP2) and the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) were required for EGFR-mediated NF-&#954;B activation. Upon EGF stimulation, EGFR recruited PKP2 to the plasma membrane, and PKP2 bridged HOIP, the catalytic E3 ubiquitin ligase in the LUBAC, to the EGFR complex. The recruitment activated the LUBAC complex and the linear ubiquitination of NEMO, leading to I&#954;B phosphorylation and subsequent NF-&#954;B activation. Furthermore, EGF-induced linear ubiquitination was critical for tumor cell proliferation and tumor development. Knockout of HOIP impaired EGF-induced NF-&#954;B activity and reduced cell proliferation. HOIP knockout also abrogated the growth of A431 epidermal xenograft tumors in nude mice by more than 70%.

In an effort to study Ras inhibitors in cells and identify new compounds that inhibit Ras and its downstream signaling, assays such as western or ELISA are commonly used. These traditional immunoassays can be tedious, require multiple washing steps, and are not easily adaptable to a high throughput screening (HTS) format. To overcome these limitations, we developed Lumit, a novel immunoassay approach that combines bioluminescent enzyme subunit complementation technology and immunodetection. We applied this bioluminescent and homogeneous &#8220;Add and Read&#8221; assay to analyze Ras signaling pathway activation and inhibition through multiple nodes of the pathway including detection of phosphorylated ERK. The assay was used to profile different allele specific inhibitors with cell lines harboring different activating KRAS mutations and obtained the predicted pharmacology and selectivity. The potency of PROTAC compound targeting selective degradation of KRAS G12C was also tested using Lumit and the result showed that maximal decrease in RAS signaling was achieved. Unlike current assays that require lengthy sample preparation and multiple washing steps, the Lumit immunoassay provides an alternative platform because it is homogeneous and allows to decipher signaling pathways activities in a fast and simple manner. Our results demonstrate that this bioluminescent technology can be adapted to any signaling pathway node, allowing scientists to streamline the analysis of signaling pathways of interest such as Ras, and identify much needed inhibitors of its mutants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68016591-6c76-4569-af2e-f3a9b95d21af\/@y03B8ZHX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,ERK,Immunoassay,Bioluminescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13190"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hicham Zegzouti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurie Engel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Swiatnicki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliano Alves<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Said A.

It remains unknown how resistant tumor cells influence sensitive cells during conditions of cohabitation. The goal of our study was to determine driving factors mediating interactions between resistant and sensitive cancer cells and the effects of cohabitation on both phenotypes.<br \/><b>Materials and methods:<\/b> We used two isogenic ovarian cancer cell lines pairs, sensitive and resistant to platinum: OVCAR5 (IC50 = 2.05 uM) vs. OVCAR5-CisR (IC50 = 7.26 uM) and PEO1 (IC50 = 5.92 uM) vs. PE04 (IC50 = 14.45 uM) labeled with either GFP or RFP. The cell pairs were seeded together in long direct term culture, separated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and used for RNAseq analysis, proliferation assays, Cisplatin IC50 determinations, and cell cycle analysis.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Long Term direct co-culture (14 Days) of platinum-sensitive and -resistant cells induced increased proliferation (p &#60; 0.001) and a greater proportions of cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle in sensitive PEO1 and OVCAR5 cells compared with cells cultured by themselves. Resistance to platinum of the sensitive cell lines decreased further by co-culture (IC50 change from 5.92 uM to 2.79 uM in PE01, and from 2.05 uM to 1.51 uM in OVCAR5). No changes in cell proliferation, or resistance to platinum occurred in the platinum resistant cells. Use of conditioned media of resistance cells did not change proliferation, or response to platinum of sensitive cells. RNAseq detected 3840 differentially expressed genes; 1774 upregulated and 2066 downregulated. IPA analysis showed enrichment of the cell cycle pathways (<i>Cell Cycle Control, Cyclins and Cell Cycle Regulation<\/i>, among others) and upregulation of cell proliferation genes including the E2F1 transcription factor. Western blot and qRT-PCR confirmed upregulation of E2F1 in co-cultured platinum sensitive cells vs cells in monoculture. Furthermore, western blot measurements showed increased levels of other proteins involved in cell cycle regulation such as CDK4 and CDK6. Cell cycle analysis indicated an increase of cells in S and G2 phase in the co-cultured platinum sensitive cells (18.8% up G2 phase; p = 0.031). Treatment with the CDK4\/6 inhibitor Palbociclib or with the E2F1 inhibitor HLM006474 reverted the increase in proliferation rate.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Long term cohabitation of platinum-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells drives sensitive cells to a higher proliferative state, which is more responsive to platinum. Direct cell-cell contact modulates cell cycle progression in sensitive cells through a mechanism regulated by E2F1. Our data reveal unexpected effects caused by interactions between cancer cells with different proliferative rates and levels of platinum resistance, modelling competition between cells in heterogeneous tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/96aefc3d-1ddb-4ac0-a1a2-ed69c61be85b\/@y03B8ZHX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer cell,E2F1,Carboplatin,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13191"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andres Felipe Valdivia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Cowan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangyuan Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Horacio Cardenas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniela Matei<\/i><\/presenter>.

What drives a subset of luminal DCIS to transition to basal invasive breast cancers is unclear. Basal-like invasive breast cancers are aggressive and associated with the shortest overall survival and time to distant metastasis. We have previously shown that N-Ras is highly expressed selectively in the basal-like subtypes of invasive breast cancers and can promote their growth and progression. In this study, we investigated whether <i>NRAS<\/i> expression at the DCIS stage can control transition from luminal DCIS to basal-like invasive breast cancers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Wilcoxon rank-sum test was conducted to assess the relative expression of <i>NRAS<\/i> in DCIS compared to invasive breast cancers in a patient cohort (GSE59248). <i>NRAS<\/i> levels were also determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a collection of 21 patient tumor microarrays (TMAs) with concurrent normal, DCIS, and invasive breast cancer, and <i>NRAS<\/i>&#8217;s association with DCIS and invasive breast cancer was assessed by Wilcoxon signed rank test. How <i>NRAS<\/i> levels correlated with basal biomarkers in the TMAs, as well as in patient datasets GSE59248 and GSE3369 was determined by Pearson correlation.

In this context, we aim to identify novel targets in mPC by focusing on key mitochondrial signaling pathways exploited by mPC. Here we identify a novel mitochondrial signaling pathway centered on mitochondrial Rho GTPase 2 (MIRO2). MIRO2 mRNA is upregulated in mPC compared to localized tumors, and higher MIRO2 levels are correlated with poor patient survival. Despite this association, the importance of MIRO2 in tumor cell biology has been overlooked. To address this, we examined MIRO2&#8217;s role in tumor cell-intrinsic phenotypes of relevance to metastatic potential. Using human cell lines that represent androgen-independent and -sensitive mPC, we showed that MIRO2 depletion impaired cell growth, colony formation, tumor cell invasion and migration, and tumor growth in mice. Next we reasoned that identifying MIRO2&#8217;s protein binding partners would shed light on the molecular function of MIRO2 in mPC. Network analysis of MIRO2&#8217;s binding partners identified metabolism, cell cycle, and cellular responses to extracellular stimuli amongst the top over-represented pathways. Interestingly, the top hit on our screen was General Control Non-derepressible 1 (GCN1). GCN1 was an essential gene for 90% of the cell lines in a large pan-cancer screen for gene essentiality. GCN1 is the upstream activator of the kinase GCN2, which senses amino acid availability, actin dynamics cues in cells, and regulates cell cycle progression. Our results showed that MIRO2 is necessary for efficient GCN2 signaling, activation of the integrated stress response, and downstream translation of the transcription factor ATF4 in culture and tumors in mice. Further, exogenous expression of ATF4 restored clonogenic growth of MIRO2 depleted cells. MIRO2 and GCN1 expression were positively correlated in mPC from patient cohorts, and GCN1 was overexpressed in mPC compared to primary PC. Further, MIRO2-GCN1 interacted in mPC cell lines and in primary PC cells. We showed activated GCN2 and HIF1&#945; were positively correlated in tumors grown in mice. Together, the data suggest our pathway is important in nutrient limited regions of tumors. In conclusion, MIRO2 belongs to a novel protein network that controls mPC cellular responses and adaptation to extracellular stimuli. Overall, we propose a new mechanism by which a mitochondrial retrograde signal can drive prostate cancer cell growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6c537f6-02e9-448b-abfc-8d26830af8e3\/@y03B8ZHX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Cell signaling,GTPase,Tumor growth,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13193"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Madison Furnish<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dillon Boulton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victoria Genther<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denisa Grofova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell L.

Although RHOA has long been implicated in malignant transformation in solid tumors, recent evidences have demonstrated its tumor suppressor activity in different subgroups of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Here, using a panel of 11 cell lines covering the most common and\/or aggressive B-NHL subtypes, we observed that the lowest mRNA and protein levels of RHOA are found in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), the most aggressive entity with a median overall survival of 5-7 years. Depletion of RHOA expression and activity was carried out in the two RHOA+ MCL cell lines, REC-1 and Z-138, by CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated gene edition followed by RHOA pulldown activation assay. In RHOA knockout (KO) subclones, cell proliferation was increased by 40%, in association with a 10-fold increase in mitotic index and a 3-fold potentiation of cell migration, as assessed respectively by CellTitter-Glo assay, histone H3-pSer10 labeling and Transwell assay, thus suggesting a tumor suppressor role of RHOA in MCL malignancy. Comparative RNA-seq analysis of RHOA<sup>WT<\/sup> and RHOA<sup>KO<\/sup> MCL subclones then highlighted a crucial role of RHOA and its downstream signaling in the control of MCL cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell migration. Interestingly, the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide has previously shown to regulate such processes and to be clinically active in patients with relapsed\/refractory MCL. In a co-culture system associating RHOA<sup>WT<\/sup> MCL cells with peripheral blood-derived effector cells, we observed that lenalidomide treatment facilitated the formation of immunological synapse, as revealed by simultaneous immunodetection of effector T cells, target B cells and perforin, and by quantification of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release.

Many invasive cancers form invadopodia, which are protrusive, degradative structures that are regulated by the Rho family of GTPases. Rho GTPases commonly have aberrant activity in invasive cancers caused by changes in their upstream regulators: RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs. We have identified the RhoGAP ARHGAP17 (RICH1\/NADRIN) as a negative regulator of invadopodia in triple negative breast cancer. Using confocal and STORM super-resolution microscopy techniques, we show that ARHGAP17 localizes to the regulatory ring surrounding invadopodia where it acts to promote disassembly by decreasing invadopodia lifetime through the inactivation of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. We further support these results in live cells by using a new localization-based Cdc42 biosensor, which reveals that ARHGAP17 suppresses Cdc42 activity specifically at the invadopodia ring. We have also identified the Cdc42 effector CIP4 as part of a complex with ARHGAP17 and Cdc42 that we propose is key in the regulation of invadopodia. Finally, using spheroid and inverse invasion assays, we show that the invadopodia phenotype correlates with increased invasive properties. <i>In conclusion<\/i>, we have identified ARHGAP17 as a key regulator of invadopodia and invasion in triple negative breast cancer by localizing to invadopodia and inactivating Cdc42 as part of a complex with CIP4.<b> <\/b>In future studies, we will further characterize the molecular mechanisms that regulate the ARHGAP17\/Cdc42\/CIP4 complex and their function during invadopodia formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03e1803c-145d-4488-8741-2f90d618d10b\/@y03B8ZHX\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Invasion,Signaling,GTPase activating protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13197"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gabriel Kreider-Letterman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abel Castillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agustin Rabino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eike K.

Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has emerged as a potential target for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. Bortezomib, a first generation proteasome inhibitor clinically approved for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma, has previously been demonstrated to induce tumor regression in a subset of HNSCC patients through the inhibition of canonical NF&#954;B activity; however, the failure of Bortezomib to inhibit other pro-survival pathways such as MAPK and STAT3 signalling resulted in heterologous responses. A recently developed alternative to proteasome inhibitors is the small molecule b-AP15, which inhibits the proteasomal deubiquitinases USP14 and UCHL5, thus allowing more specificity and less toxicity than proteasome inhibitors.<br \/>Here, we show b-AP15 inhibits proliferation and colony formation in multiple HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC cell lines, with minimal effects in normal oral keratinocytes. Furthermore, b-AP15 induces significant caspase-dependent apoptosis. Using siRNA targetting USP14 and UCHL5, only USP14 depletion significantly reduced cell proliferation and colony formation. Mechanistically, b-AP15 treatment reduces TNF&#945;-induced NF&#954;B activity and the expression of pro-survival proteins such as cIAP2 and TRAF2, promoting the formation of the TNFR complex II and sensitizing cells to TNF&#945;-induced cell death. Finally, TCGA data demonstrates that USP14 is highly expressed in HNSCC when compared with normal tissue and is significantly correlated with worse overall survival. Together, we have identified that inhibition of proteasomal deubiquitinases inhibits the proliferation and survival of HNSCC cells and enhanced TNF&#945;-induced cell death via the inhibition of NF&#954;B activity. Our data suggest that combination therapies with b-AP15 could potentially offer a clinical benefit in HNSCC patients by promoting TNF&#945;-induced cytotoxicity. Further studies will focus on the mechanism by which USP14 regulates NF&#954;B signalling in HNSCC cells and the effect of b-AP15 activity in combination with radiation treatment in <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse xenograft models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82ef094a-d94b-4a9e-9b64-c799467f83fb\/@y03B8ZHX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-08 Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,NF-&#954;B,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13201"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ethan L.

Current mainstay treatment for ovarian cancer is surgical removal followed by chemotherapy. Although patients initially respond well, most of patients suffer from relapse and die from metastasis. Therefore, developing successful approaches combatting metastasis is most likely to prolong patients&#8217; survival and improve their life quality. Toward this goal, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas ovarian cancer patient dataset to reach for targetable genes preferentially elevated in advanced ovarian cancer. Among them, we found that knockdown of fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) led to dramatic apoptosis in mesenchymal-like ovarian cancer cells. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we performed RNAseq and identified that TNF-alpha\/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway was impaired in FAP-knockdown cells. NF-&#954;B signaling pathway is well characterized to promote cell survival by elevating the expression of pro-survival genes. In fact, the level of survivin was diminished upon FAP-knockdown. As forced expression of survivin almost completely abrogated apoptosis elicited by FAP-knockdown and survivin inhibitor also induced robust apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, we reason that FAP participates in ovarian cancer development by promoting cell survival through activation of NF-&#954;B\/survivin axis. With the aid of EpCAM aptamer as delivering cargo, we demonstrated that FAP siRNA was able to suppress intraperitoneal ovarian cancer development. This study suggests that FAP is an ideal therapeutic target against mesenchymal-like ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cdea334d-7c24-42fc-8378-bbdcafb4eeea\/@y03B8ZHX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumorigenesis,Fibroblasts,NF-&#954;B,Survivin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13202"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bin Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuang Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, development of more efficacious treatment option is crucial to improve clinical outcomes. We have used TCGA and CPTAC analysis from UALCAN data base for the expression of CCR6 and CCL20 in colon cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal. RT-qPCR and proteomics approach were used for analysis of CCR6 and CCL20 expression in colon cancer cell lines. Our data shows higher expression of CCR6 and its ligand CCL20 in colon cancer tissue and cell lines. We further investigated involvement of CCR6\/CCL20 on therapeutic response of 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin commonly used to treat colon cancer. Our data suggest that colon cancer cell lines respond poorly to 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin when treated with CCL20 and blocking CCR6 with anti-CCR6 improves cytotoxic effect of 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Poor response to chemotherapeutic after CCR6 activation was primarily due to activation molecular and cellular phenotypes and alteration in cell cycle. In conclusion, our data suggest that CCR6\/CCL20 promotes colon cancer progression and CCR6-mediates signals contributed to poor response to conventional therapeutic such as 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Hence, targeting CCR6 in early stage will prevent metastasis, enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity and will be a promising approach to improve clinical outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/712d952b-b594-448c-8cb0-d07e932120a2\/@y03B8ZHX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Chemokine receptor,Chemokines,Cell cycle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13203"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Briana A.

Unfortunately, the current multimodality management approach does not lead to long term survival benefits. Several prognostic factors such as Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) &#38; Blood Tumor Barrier (BTB), Glioma Stem-like Cells (GSCs), an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and genetic heterogeneity promotes GBM progression. To improve treatment efficacy, these factors should be addressed in a rational manner. Our pre-clinical investigations indicate that maintenance of CD38 expression, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is vital to GBM survival. CD38 could be an ideal biologically relevant target as it is homogeneously expressed on tumor cells and its TME elements. Furthermore, accessibility of FDA approved anti-CD38 therapies, non-overlapping toxicities and potential to cross the BBB has granted approval of our phase I study using Radiation\/Temozolomide and Immunotherapy with Daratumumab to Improve Antitumor Efficacy in newly diagnosed Glioblastoma (PRIDE) (NCT04922723). In brief, we performed Western blot (WB), RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry to examine CD38 expression on human GBM cell lines and microglia (LN229, T98G, DI-321, SA21 and HMC3) including CD38 transfected cells. We used trans well assays to analyze changes in CD38 expression in several environments. MTS viability assay was used to study the viability of Temozolomide on GBM cells. Basal expression of CD38 on GBM cells was assessed, showing that CD38 expression varies amongst cell lines and components of its TME. CD38 negative (flow sorted) cells regain CD38 expression around Day 4 after sorting, indicating that CD38 is crucial for GBM survival. We then sorted cells into CD38 negative and positive and performed trans well experiments with overexpressing and knock down cells, revealing that CD38 expression changes based upon surrounding cells in its environment. Cells transfected with shRNA against CD38 have a slower proliferative rate compared to wild-type and CD38 overexpressing cells. We also saw that LN229 Temozolomide (TMZ) resistant (LN229-TR) cells also have a slower proliferative rate and show an increase in CD38 expression. We also observed that CD133, SOX2 and Nestin are significantly over expressed in LN229-TR compared to LN229 CD38 WT, while sharing similar CD38 expression as GSCs and malignant GBM cells. IC50 of TMZ on CD38 overexpressing cells was significantly higher than CD38 WT GBM cells suggesting that CD38 expression contributes towards treatment resistance. All experiments were performed in triplicate and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Our preliminary data suggests that CD38 is regulating the proliferation rate as well as stem cell like features of GBM cells. Moreover, overexpression of CD38 is leading to TMZ resistance in pre-clinical models. Our ongoing in vitro and in vivo gene deletion experiments will further solidify the biological importance of CD38 in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Cancer progression,Resistance,Progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13204"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Leland Earp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Srishti Kala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sonikpreet Aulakh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
