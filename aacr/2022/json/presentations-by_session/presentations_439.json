[{"Abstract":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal type of brain cancer with 5-year survival of &#60;15%. The unique microenvironment of GBM is a key factor in tumor aggression. Similar to other solid tumors, GBM cells experience different biomechanical forces than do cells in healthy brain tissue. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to perform micro-compression mechanical analysis of xenografted GBM tumors. We show that tumors have a relatively stiff core (5-6 kPa Young&#8217;s modulus) and a softer edge (1-2 kPa Young&#8217;s modulus), yet all tumor tissue was stiffer than adjacent brain tissue (0.5-0.8 kPa Young&#8217;s modulus). To understand the functional implications of this biomechanical landscape, GBM spheroids were encapsulated in 3D culture matrices tuned to mimic the measured stiffnesses of a tumor regions and neighboring, non-cancerous tissue. These 3D matrices are fabricated from hyaluronic acid to promote GBM\/matrix interaction through CD44 and RHAMM. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed overexpression of mitochondrial-encoded genes in stiff conditions, specifically genes encoding proteins involved in oxidation phosphorylation (OXPHOS), when compared to soft hydrogels. Using fluorescence-life time imaging microscopy to assess metabolic states at a single-cell level, we found that metabolism in GBM cells cultured in stiff matrices was dominated by OXPHOS while those in softer matrices was dominated by glycolysis (GLY). Furthermore, we show that this stiffness-induced shift towards OXPHOS in stiff matrices was associated with increased proliferation while the shift towards GLY in soft matrices was associated with increased migratory activity. Finally, inhibition of ezrin, an adaptor molecule linking the HA receptor CD44 to the actin cytoskeleton, eliminated the shift towards GLY induced in soft matrices, indicating that HA-CD44 interactions are necessary for these matrix-induced metabolic shifts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5297c329-a3d5-46c3-b5d5-bb46321a5021\/@B03B8ZKS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Microenvironment,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11425"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alireza Sohrabi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Austin Lefebvre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Condro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harley Kornblum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Digman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Seidlits<\/i><\/presenter>.

A detailed analysis needs to be performed for each cancer type to identify relevant cell types and secreted factors promoting metastasis. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is an aggressive liver cancer that predominantly afflicts adolescents and young adults who lack predisposing conditions, and patients with FLC are characterized by a heterozygous deletion on chromosome 19 that creates an oncogenic gene fusion, <i>DNAJB1-PRKACA<\/i>. The extracellular environment of FLC tumors is poorly characterized and may contribute to cancer progression, metastasis, and\/or drug resistance. To bridge this knowledge gap, we performed experiments to assess pathways relevant to proteoglycans, a major component of the extracellular matrix. We first analyzed gene expression data from FLC and non-malignant liver tissue (n=27) to identify changes in pathways pertinent to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis. We then developed and implemented a novel chemical analytics method, utilizing custom molecular standards, to quantify the abundance of different types of GAGs in patient tumor samples by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. We then measured the mRNA and protein levels of different GAG-associated proteins, followed by immunohistochemical confirmation. Finally, we performed the first single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) on FLC tumors to define the heterogeneous cellular landscape and to identify cell types likely responsible for producing the most dominant GAG-associated protein in FLC. We found that chondroitin sulfate (CS) but not heparan sulfate (HS) or hyaluronic acid (HA) biosynthesis genes are dramatically increased in FLC, especially the rate-limiting enzyme CS GalNAc transferase 1 (<i>CSGALNACT1<\/i>). We also determined that CS chains are significantly elevated in FLC. Further analysis showed that versican (VCAN) is the primary CS-associated protein in FLC, that <i>CSGALNACT1<\/i> and <i>VCAN<\/i> are correlated with <i>DNAJB1-PRKACA<\/i> levels, and that <i>VCAN<\/i> is more highly expressed in FLC compared to almost all other cancer types. Finally, the single cell ATAC-seq analyses demonstrated for the first time the cellular heterogeneity of FLC and revealed that the <i>VCAN<\/i> locus is active in tumor epithelial cells but is most active in proliferating stellate cells. This study merges chemical, molecular, and single-cell analyses to uncover the marked elevation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in FLC tumors. Our results suggest that VCAN may play a critical role in FLC tumor growth and\/or metastasis. We also identified the presence of activated stellate cells in FLC tumors and suggest a role in propagating fibrosis. Future studies are required to identify whether and how attenuation of CS and\/or VCAN mitigates proliferative and\/or metastatic potential in FLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/54c9906f-942a-43e6-b3f1-16e212b52ca7\/@B03B8ZKS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Single cell,Glycosylation,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11426"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adam Francisco<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jine Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alaa Farghili<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matt Kanke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Shui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wencheng Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Soloway<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhangjie Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lola Reid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Praveen Sethupathy<\/i><\/presenter>.

Most of the solid cancers can be associated with a reorganization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the tumor leading to fibrosis and increased tissue stiffness, contributing to disease malignancy. Colorectal cancer (CRC) makes no exception to this microenvironment reorganization. The colon stroma is home to multiple cell types involved in ECM biodynamics such as the FoxL1+ Telocytes (TC<sup>FoxL1+<\/sup>) which form a network underneath the epithelium, contributing to the microenvironment that supports epithelial and immune cell homeostasis. Our group already showed, in a mouse model of CRC, that BMPR1A signaling deletion in TC<sup>FoxL1+ <\/sup>influences the microenvironment via stromagenesis, immune infiltration and colonic dysplasia. However, the precise biomolecular and biomechanical events that contributes to the onset of this state have yet to be identified. We aimed to identify the early-onset dysplastic modulations in ECM biodynamics induced by <i>BmpR1a<\/i>-deficient TC<sup>FoxL1+<\/sup> (<i>BmpR1a<\/i><sup>&#916;<\/sup><sup>FoxL1+<\/sup>) in mouse colonic mucosa. Matrisomics analysis was thus performed to determine the inventory of ECM proteins expressed solely in the GI stroma following tissue deconstruction of control and <i>BmpR1a<\/i><sup>&#916;<\/sup><sup>FoxL1+ <\/sup>mice colons. Characterization of the collagen network and matrisome-associated modulations was evaluated by histological and biochemical methods. Presence of bacteria invading the mucosa was studied by Fluorescence <i>In Situ<\/i> Hybridization (FISH). Matrisome proteins that were differentially regulated indicate an enrichment for proteins involved in collagen network regulation, wound repair homeostasis and immune response. Increased deposition of collagen, presence of thicker fibers realigned into linear patterns were observed in <i>BmpR1a<\/i><sup>&#916;<\/sup><sup>FoxL1+<\/sup> mouse colon, leading to change in tissue stiffness and biomechanics. Abnormal presence of unfolded collagen with a concomitant increase in a collagen-folding chaperone was also observed. Validations of proteins involved in fibrin clot formation as well as immune response mediators such as S100A9 indicate that <i>BmpR1a<\/i><sup>&#916;<\/sup><sup>FoxL1+<\/sup> mice deal with tissue micro-injuries and inflammation that is unresolved, creating an unfavorable microenvironment for tissue homeostasis leading to neoplasia initiation. Taken together, these results suggest that Bmp-signaling deficient TC<sup>FoxL1+<\/sup> significantly contribute to the collagen network biodynamics through increased collagen deposition, fiber alignment reorganization and regulation of the triple-helix assembly. Other matrisome modulations suggest a state of unresolved wound healing due to tissue injury, that could be the etiology of GI pathology such as CRC and lead to more severe conditions upon various environmental triggers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/96a16f41-cd14-4c75-9495-f30175225ce6\/@B03B8ZKS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,Tumor microenvironment,Stroma,Bone morphogenetic proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11428"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Veronique Pomerleau<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vilcy Reyes Nicolas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carla-Marie Jurkovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>François-Michel Boisvert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathalie Perreault<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite extensive research and developments in immunotherapy, there are limited improvements in overall survival for these patients. Recent research has found that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in tumor initiation, therapy resistance, and tumor relapse. The TME, which consists of immune cells, blood vessels, and an extracellular matrix (ECM) built primarily by fibroblasts, may enhance the survival and growth of tumor-initiating cells (TICs), chemoresistant stem-like cells thought to be responsible for tumor relapse. Cytotoxic chemotherapies have been shown to modify the TME and this modulation may favor the survival of TICs. For example, carboplatin can activate stromal cells such as fibroblasts to secrete an altered ECM profile, including increases in collagen 1a1 and fibronectin production, which can bind specific integrins upregulated in TICs. Using ex-vivo decellularized peritoneum tissues from mice exposed to chemotherapy or vehicle treatment, we observed a 2-fold increase in growth in peritoneums pre-exposed to chemotherapy relative to those pre-exposed to vehicle. We hypothesize that alterations in the ECM following chemotherapy treatment permit TIC adhesion and growth. To investigate this, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (3T3s) were exposed to chemotherapy during ECM production, decellularized, and reseeded with a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. Our results suggest a significant increase in cell survival in matrices pre-exposed to chemotherapy compared to control matrices pre-exposed to vehicle. Using this model, we are examining the features of cells that preferentially survive on these matrices. In addition to drug resistance, we are using flow cytometry to assess TIC markers, such as CD117, and CD133, and qRT-PCR to measure stemness genes such as SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG. These studies highlight the need for further investigation into the systemic effects of chemotherapies on the TME and how these changes may be fostering cancer cell adhesion, growth, and survival. Understanding these mechanisms will allow us to develop therapies to achieve better clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4e730078-32a6-4ffe-b387-2076f3ca996d\/@C03B8ZKT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Extracellular matrix,Chemoresistance,Fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11448"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Omar Lujano-Olazaba<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikella Robinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel F.

The effects of the extracellular matrix (ECM) on cancer progression have been long studied, but the roles of specific integrins in the process of HNSCC metastasis remain to be dissected. This study aims to determine how HNSCC cells affect the production of laminin-binding integrins, and how these integrins participate in the ECM interactions necessary for a metastatic phenotype.<br \/><b>Experimental design:<\/b> Our laboratory has produced syngeneic mouse SCC cell lines, P029 and A223, derived from Keratin15+ stem cells with Smad4 loss and Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutation. In syngeneic recipients, SCCs derived from P029 cells transplanted to the flank mouse skin produced spontaneous metastases to the lung while SCCs derived from A223 cells did not form metastases. Having the same genotype, these cell lines serve as models to examine cancer cell interactions with the ECM and resulting effects on invasion and metastasis. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed to compare cultured metastatic P029 cells versus non-metastatic A223 cells and identify differentially expressed genes that regulate SCC cells and ECM interactions. Immunoassays and functional invasion assays were performed to evaluate ECM-cancer cell signaling and influence on cancer cell invasion in these two cell lines.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RNAseq analysis revealed that, relative to A223 cells, P029 cells have increased levels of integrins, the main mechanoreceptors for numerous ECM ligands and matrix proteins. Laminin-binding integrins, including integrins &#945;4 and &#946;6, were greater at the RNA and protein levels. Additionally, P029 cells expressed higher levels of fibronectin and laminin coding genes compared to non-metastatic A223 cells. Correlatively, high expression of these matrix proteins is associated with worse patient survival. Additionally, P029 SCC cells displayed differential gene expression of tight and apical junctions, PI3K signaling components, and regulators of cytoskeletal remodeling. Furthermore, ELISA and western blot analysis revealed that P029 has aberrant TGF&#946;-Smad signaling as indicated by the elevated release of TGF&#946;-1 protein and higher levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 relative to non-metastatic A223. Treating P029 cells with TGF&#946;-1 significantly increased their motility and invasion. Conversely, migration and motility of P029 cells were radically reduced by the TGF&#946; inhibitor galunisertib. Additionally, the mouse cytokine array revealed that mouse plasma bearing P029 tumors had a greater circulation of CXCL16, MMP-9, proliferin, and serpin E1. These proteins are associated with ECM remodeling and metastasis in HNSCC.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> SCC cells with metastatic properties upregulate integrins which bind to non-collagen matrix proteins and have elevated invasive and migratory capacity contributed from activated TGF&#946; signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/36bf4c1d-4462-47ee-a61d-a49da88659c4\/@C03B8ZKT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Integrins,Squamous cell carcinoma,Extracellular matrix,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11449"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John Aleman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khoa A.

Integrin &#945;6&#946;1 is associated with prostate cancer (PCa) migration, invasion, metastasis, and decreased cancer-specific survival. Kindlin-2 (FERMT2) is a &#946;1 integrin adaptor and mechanosensory focal adhesion (FA) protein that activates and clusters integrins in response to structural ECM alterations in the tumor microenvironment. Our goal was to determine if integrin-kindlin-2 adhesion complexes (kindlin-2:&#945;6&#946;1) were responsive to hypoxia, a physiologically relevant and altered microenvironment in PCa progression. Five different endpoints were tested including the biochemical analysis of kindlin-2 complexes, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and electric cell impedance sensing (ECIS). Using DU145 prostate cancer cells grown under hypoxia (1% O<sub>2<\/sub>) for up to 16 hours, the results showed a reversible increase in kindlin-2:&#945;6&#946;1 complexes with maximal assembly within 4 hours and disassembly starting by 8 hours. Notably, kindlin-2:&#945;6&#946;1 complexes were found exclusively within membrane projections and were not observed within hypoxia-inducible paxillin (PXN)-containing FAs. The hypoxia induced kindlin-2:&#945;6&#946;1 complexes and classical FAs were dependent on kindlin-2 as determined by CRISPR-Cas9 heterozygous deletion of FERMT2. Protein co-localization of &#945;6 integrin and PXN with kindlin-2 within membrane projections and FAs, respectively, was also induced under hypoxia. Further, non-invasive ECIS measurements in live cells confirmed functional cell-cell and cell-ECM dynamics driven by hypoxia and requiring kindlin-2. Our results indicate that the kindlin-2:&#945;6&#946;1 complexes are uniquely associated with FA-independent membrane projections induced by hypoxia, a tumor microenvironment associated with aggressive prostate cancer. The novel kindlin-2:&#945;6&#946;1 complexes may represent an actionable pharmacological target for blocking escape of organ confined disease and metastasis promoting steps of human prostate cancer.<br \/>(Partially supported by NIH grants CA P30 23074, DOD W81XWH-19-1-0455, and NCI R01 CA242226).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b98fca68-f289-405a-8316-879c8ae5bdb0\/@C03B8ZKT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Integrins,Extracellular matrix,Hypoxia,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11450"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Hernandez-Cortes<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaime M.C.

TIMPs are important regulators of ECM structure, function and homeostasis. Since their original discovery, additional MMP-independent functions have been attributed to TIMP family members leading to their designation as multifunctional proteins with discrete functional domains. TIMP2 is a unique family member, with a broad expression profile that is expressed in both normal and diseased tissues, even in those with minimal metalloproteinase activity. Understanding the functional transformation of matrisome regulators, like TIMP-2, during the dynamic evolution of tissue microenvironments associated with disease progression is essential to the development of ECM targeted therapeutics. This knowledge may also garner understanding of therapeutic resistance and the failure of conventional and next-generation cancer therapies. Interactome studies are predominantly performed in non-living systems, and very rarely performed in complex culture systems such as 3D spheroids\/co-cultures. To investigate the TIMP-2 interactome in complex biological systems we recently developed carboxyl- and amino-terminal fusion genes of TIMP-2 with the promiscuous biotinylating peptides BioID2 and TurboID. Packaged for retroviral delivery, this system gives us great flexibility in assessing the TIMP-2 interactome in simple versus complex 3D co-culture systems. We show, for the first time, that conditions can be optimized to support proximity labeling reactions in the extracellular milieu, representing an important technical resource for extracellular matrix biologists. Using this method, we identify novel interacting partners for TIMP-2 that provide insight into the tissue-specific actions of this protein in both healthy and diseased tissues.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d1fbf30b-7a8e-45e2-8dcc-7f113605b14b\/@C03B8ZKT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,TIMP,Matrix metalloprotease,Proteomic analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11451"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Peeney<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadeechya Gurung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yueqin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolyn Lazaroff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Richie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William G.

Additionally, TIMPs display activities that are independent of their MMP inhibitory activities. Dysregulation and perturbations within this system can lead to complex tissue-specific pathologies. TIMP2 is the most abundantly expressed member of the TIMP family and has been shown to display potential therapeutic uses in cancer and other diseases. We have noted the persistent presence of SDS-stable TIMP2 dimers\/multimers in SDS-PAGE at a level of ~5% total protein. The goal of this study is to determine the stability and biological relevance of SDS-stable dimer formation of TIMP2 in in vitro and in vivo. We found that TIMP2 dimers display an enhanced ability to inhibit MMP2 activity in reverse zymography assays. Immunoblotting revealed gel extracted TIMP2 dimer entered an equilibrium with monomeric TIMP2, while the extracted monomer did not form new dimer. In addition, MMP2 activity assays do not corroborate the enhanced MMP2 inhibitory activity observed in reverse zymograms but are consistent with the observation that isolated TIMP2 dimers re-equilibrate with monomers. This implies that structural or sequence difference mediates the formation of dimers. Dimer\/multimer formation is observed across the TIMP family. Mass spectrometry analysis of gel extracted TIMP monomers and dimers show that monomer and dimer forms of TIMPs display unique post-translation modification (PTM) profiles. We propose that understanding the interplay between TIMP multimers and PTMs will reveal new biological functions within this intriguing family of proteins.

For instance, <i>in vitro<\/i> (2D) studies have implicated ECM properties in EAC progression. However, these studies are limited by the lack of 3D intercellular interactions, underscoring the need for physiologically relevant 3D culture models, such as patient-derived organoids (PDOs), that better recapitulate human cancer and its microenvironment to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Engineered hydrogels are an evolving and important component of 3D organoid culture systems, especially to introduce tunable physicochemical matrix signals that have been investigated in tumor progression and metastasis. Furthermore, PDOs have become an attractive pre-clinical <i>in vitro<\/i> model to study cancer biology and evaluate response to therapeutics.<br \/>METHODS: We have engineered a visible light-mediated hydrogel platform that supports the development of patient derived Barrett's esophagus (BE) organoids, a precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), as well as EAC organoids. This synthetic biomaterial platform allows control over hydrogel stiffness to better recapitulate the mechanically dynamic esophageal cancer microenvironment, and may help identify therapeutic targets in EAC organoids.<br \/>RESULTS: Our preliminary data have demonstrated that BE and EAC organoid density, size and proliferation can be controlled by synthetic ECM biomechanical properties. Furthermore, our data show that increased matrix stiffness promotes changes in the transcriptional profiles of EAC organoids, as observed via Principal Component Analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis of upregulated genes reveals enrichment of anti-apoptotic pathways. This suggests that the synthetic ECM facilitates activation of mechanotransduction pathways in EAC organoids and that matrix mechanics have a significant role in activation of canonical anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. Ongoing studies involve identifying matrix stiffness-activated therapeutic targets via small molecule inhibition of upregulated genes that are considered prospective biomarkers in GI cancer.<br \/>SUMMARY: Our work is significant because it establishes a biomaterial platform that overcomes the limitations of current 3D organoid culture methods to elucidate the role of the tumor microenvironment in EAC tumorigenesis and to identify disease-relevant therapeutic targets. This work will also provide an opportunity to further establish the engineered biomaterial as a platform to potentially elucidate the mechanisms of, and therapy targets for, other human adenocarcinomas in the context of changes in matrix biomechanics.FUNDING: NCI P01-CA098101, U54 CA-163004 and Charles H.

The TME landscape consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) and stromal cells. ECM is a major component of TME that mediates interaction between cancer cells and stromal cells to promote invasion and metastasis.<b> <\/b>We have shown in published work that RASSF1C promotes cancer stem cell development, migration, and drug resistance, in part, by promoting EMT through a mechanism that involves up-regulation of the PIWIL1-piRNA gene axis. Interestingly, one of the target genes identified by our microarray study to be upregulated by RASSF1C is P4HA2. In cancer, P4H2A is vital for collagen posttranslational modification and folding. This leads to formation of a stiff ECM and induction of cancer stem cell marker gene expression, resulting in metastatic dissemination. High expression of P4HA2 is associated with significantly lower survival of lung cancer patients. Thus, RASSF1C could promote tumor cell ECM remodeling to induce lung cancer cell stemness, invasion and metastasis by up-regulating a novel PIWIL1-P4HA2 gene axis expression.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Analysis of a microarray study using H1299 cells over-expressing RASSF1C or control vector backbone identified P4HA2 as a RASSF1C gene target. RT-PCR, immunoblots, and immunofluorescence techniques were used to confirm P4HA2 gene expression using specific primers and antibodies in cells over-expressing RASSF1C or PIWIL1 along with control cells. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the relationship of P4HA2 expression to lung adenocarcinoma patient survival using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Analysis of microarray data from H1299 cells over-expressing RASSF1C or control vector backbone shows that RASSF1C up-regulates P4HA2 gene expression 2-fold. The up-regulation of P4HA2 expression by RASSF1C was confirmed by RT-PCR, immunoblots, and immunofluorescence using P4HA2 gene specific primers and antibodies. Further, H1299 cells over-expressing PIWIL1 show increased P4HA2 gene expression on immunoblots. Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that high P4HA2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma patients negatively correlates with patient survival. Thus, our findings suggest the hypothesis that RASSF1C may promote lung cancer cell ECM remodeling to induce lung cancer cell stemness, invasion and metastasis, in part, by up-regulating a novel pathway involving a PIWIL1-P4HA2 gene axis.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Investigating the role of a RASSF1C-PIWIL1-P4HA2 gene axis in ECM remodeling in lung cancer cells will provide important mechanistic information that could, in turn, lead to identification of useful biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis and targets for therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fa51a707-2761-49f4-9ab4-aa375d6d04e1\/@C03B8ZKT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Tumor microenvironment,Extracellular matrix,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11454"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yousef G.

CAFs synthesize excess amounts of collagens leading to a fibrotic TME with poor response to anti-cancer treatment. Traditionally, tumor fibrosis is defined by quantification of fibrillar collagens such as type I collagen (COL1). So-called Fibril-Associated Collagen with Interrupted Triple helices (FACITs) are less studied in this context. Type XXII collagen (COL22) is a minor FACIT located at the basement membrane. COL22 may therefore provide a different value compared to standard COL1 assessment traditionally associated with tumor fibrosis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Levels of COL1 (PRO-C1) and COL22 (PRO-C22) was measured non-invasively using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in serum from patients diagnosed with bladder-, breast-, colorectal-, head and neck-, kidney-, lung-, melanoma-, pancreatic-, prostate-, and stomach cancer (n=220) and compared to healthy controls (n=33) (Cohort 1). Based on results from Cohort 1, PRO-C22 was evaluated in an independent cohort (Cohort 2) comprising patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (n=39) and healthy controls (n=20). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic performance of PRO-C22. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association between PRO-C22 and overall survival (OS) after dichotomizing PRO-C22 at the median cutpoint.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In Cohort 1, PRO-C22 was significantly higher in patients with all individual cancer types compared to healthy controls (p&#60;0.01 to p&#60;0.0001). In support, the area under the ROC (AUROC) for separation of patients with cancer from healthy controls using PRO-C22 ranged from 0.89 to 0.98 (p&#60;0.0001). As comparison PRO-C1 assesment showed no significant difference. PRO-C22 was also significantly higher in patients with PDAC (Cohort 2) when compared to healthy (p&#60;0.0001) with an AUROC of 0.87 (p&#60;0.0001). Furthermore, high PRO-C22 levels were associated with shorter OS (median OS days 162 and 1363 for &#8216;high&#8217; and &#8216;low&#8217; PRO-C22 subgroups, respectively, p=0.0011). Likewise, high PRO-C22 levels at baseline predicted increased risk of mortality (HR=3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86, p=0.0020).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These proof-of-concept data indicate that PRO-C22 may exhibit potential as a novel diagnostic and prognostic tumor fibrosis biomarker in cancer. PRO-C22 may be superior to type PRO-C1. Larger comprehensive clinical cohorts are needed to fully understand the biology associated with COL22 in cancer as well as the biomarker potential of PRO-C22 in various cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2bc156f-fec0-4c3b-a610-d056e8d15024\/@C03B8ZKT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Extracellular matrix,Collagen,Serum marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11456"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emilie Albrecht Madsen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeppe Thorlacius-Ussing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Jensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neel I.

These immunologically cold tumors have lower response rates to immune-based therapies and among all colorectal cancers (CRC), only about six percent of patients have an objective response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Versican (VCAN) accumulation has been found to be negatively correlated with TILs and its proteolysis into versikine (Vkine) correlates with higher TILs. In this study we analyze the association between VCAN accumulation\/proteolysis and TILs in CRC from patients with both resectable primary CRCs and matched liver metastases.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> VCAN, Vkine, and TIL abundance were assessed via immunohistochemistry, with VCAN and Vkine being measured using an intensity binning system ranging from 0-3+ and TILs counted at 40X magnification for each tumor. Tumors were then designated as high (2 or 3+) or low (0 or 1) for both VCAN and Vkine. Tumors that were designated VCAN low and Vkine high are considered VCAN proteolytic predominant (VPP) and all other combinations are considered VCAN proteolytic weak (VPW).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 53% of both primary and metastatic tumors were designated VCAN low and 47% VCAN high. 59% of metastases from patients with VCAN-high primary tumors were also designated VCAN high, whereas 43% of metastases from patients with VCAN low primary tumors were designated VCAN high. When assessing proteolysis, it was found that 37% of primary tumors were designated VPP but only 26% of metastases were found to be VPP. When comparing proteolysis in a pairwise fashion, it was found that only 37% of VPP primaries had a VPP metastasis. An inverse correlation was again found between VCAN accumulation and TILs within primary CRCs. Tumors containing high levels of VCAN had an average of three TILs\/high powered field (HPF), whereas tumors with low levels of VCAN had an average of 16 TILs\/HPF (p=0.007). VPW tumors had an average of three TILs\/HPF and VPP cores had an average of 21 TILs\/HPF (p=0.009). VPW metastatic tumors had an average of eight TILs\/HPF, whereas those that were VPP had an average of 15 TILs\/HPF (p=0.01).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Overall, these data confirm the inverse correlations between VCAN accumulation and TILs in primary CRCs. Additionally, VCAN proteolysis correlates with TILs in primary tumors and metastases.

As inhibitors of Matrix metalloproteases (MMP) they downregulate invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. However, TIMP1 levels have been found increased in patients with different types of cancer. Natural Killer cells have been found to be phenotypically and functionally compromised in several solid and hematological cancers. We were the first in characterizing NK pro-angiogenic phenotype in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of patients with Non-small Cell Lung cancer, colorectal cancers, prostate of patients. Also, we found that pro-angiogenic NK cells in the peripheral blood of colorectal cancer patients release of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, in a STAT3\/STAT5-independent manner. Here, we investigated the effects of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 recombinant proteins, using a TGF&#946;-mediated NK cell polarization model, <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/>Methods: We investigated the effects of TIMP1 and TIMP2 recombinant proteins in hindering decidual-like markers in NK cells, generated by polarizing cytolytic NK cells with TGF&#946;. The effects of TIMP1 or TIMP2 on NK cell surface antigens were determined by multicolor flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: We found that TIMP1 and TIMP2 were effective in interfering with TGF&#946; induced NK cell polarization towards a decidual-like-phenotype. TIMP1 and TIMP2 counteracted the effect of TGF&#946; in increasing the percentage of CD56<sup>bright,<\/sup> CD16<sup>-<\/sup>, CD9<sup>+<\/sup> and CD49a<sup>+<\/sup>, and restoring normal levels for TIMP 1 and 2 also inhibited decrease levels of the activation marker NKG2D induced by TGF&#946; and decreased the TGF&#946; upregulated exhaustion marker TIM-3. NK cell degranulation capabilities against K562 cells were also decreased by TGF&#946; and not by TIMP1 or TIMP2. TIMP1 treatment could partially restore degranulation marker CD107a expression.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results suggest a potential role of TIMPs in controlling the tumor-associated cytokine TGF&#946;-induced NK cell polarization. TGF&#946; stimulation represents a model to prove TIMP's new properties, further studies will help defining TIMPs immunomodulatory activities of NK cells in cancer, and their possible future diagnostic-therapeutic roles.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5aeca53-489c-4e33-99aa-f373c719db97\/@D03B8ZKU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-09 Proteases and inhibitors in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,TIMP,Natural killer cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11656"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Adriana Albini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Gallazzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Teresa Palano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Carlini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luana Calabrone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riccardo Ricotta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William G.

Here we tested the hypothesis that COL11A1 regulates the expression of immune regulatory markers in HNSCC. Xena Browser was used to analyze 520 and 42 cancer free normal head and neck tissue samples for COL11A1 expression. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNASeq data from 522 HNSCC samples was downloaded and sorted by clinical parameters and RNA expression for 20,000 genes. COL11A1 expression was correlated with tumor stage (T) and clinical stage (I-IV). Data was sorted by COL11A1 high and low based on the mean COL11A1 expression level and run through the CIBERSORT analysis tool for prediction of immune cell proportions in the tumor. HNSCC lines with COL11A1 knockdown were assessed for immune regulatory markers at the RNA and protein level. COL11A1 was found to be increased in HNSCC relative to normal tissue (tumor vs. normal p&#38;lt;0.0001). COL11A1 expression is highest in HPV negative HNSCC. Its expression correlates with increased tumor (T1 vs T4 p=0.033) and clinical stage (stage III vs. stage IV p=0.023). CIBERSORT analysis demonstrates COL11A1hi patients have significantly decreased active natural killer (NK) cells (active vs. inactive p=0.0166), CD8+ T cells (CD8 low vs. high p&#38;lt;0.0001) and active dendritic cells (active vs. inactive p=0.0035) suggesting immune modulation. COL11A1 targeted lines in vitro show decreased expression of hla-a, -c and cd274 (PD-L1), suggesting COL11A1 expression modulates immune activation by regulating immune suppressive ligands on the tumor cell. COL11A1 is overexpressed in HNSCC and drives tumor proliferation, migration and invasion. Expression levels correlate with tumor and clinical stage. Bioinformatics tool CIBERSORT, predicts decreased immune cell activity in patients with high COL11A1. Targeting COL11A1 in vitro decreased expression of immune suppressive ligands. These preliminary results indicate COL11A1 may drive immune evasion in HPV negative HNSCC. Targeting COL11A1 may improve patient response to immunotherapeutic targets in HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ce2480fb-5168-4c22-bdcb-fb9b9f9208f2\/@D03B8ZKU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Collagen,PD-L1,Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11686"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Harmony Ivanna Saunders<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Levi Arnold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Markiewicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sufi M.

Notably among this group are patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL accounts for approximately 10-20% of pediatric Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma (NHL) cases and with intensive multiagent chemotherapy the 5-year event free survival is ~90%. However, for those with progressive or relapsed disease, survival is dismal at &#60;30% and remains a clinical challenge even with use of intensive salvage regimens. As such, identifying novel agents that will increase survival in this group highlights an unmet need. Siglec-15, a member of the sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin family of proteins, has recently been identified as a critical immune suppressor that is highly expressed in human cancers and intra-tumoral myeloid cells. Importantly, inhibiting Siglec-15, either through genetic knockout or knockdown, had a restorative effect on local anti-tumor immune responses and abrogated tumor progression. While reported in solid malignancies, a role for Siglec-15 in promoting disease progression in hematologic malignancies has not yet been described.<br \/>We have evaluated Siglec-15 expression in primary human lymphoma patient samples as well as various lymphoma (human and mouse) cell lines using western blot, quantitative PCR as well immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence methods. We are evaluating the effect of inhibiting expression of Siglec-15 through genetic downregulation in human lymphoma cell lines as well as the well-established murine lymphoma cell line A20 on T cell function and proliferation using methods such as flow cytometry and ELISA.<br \/>Analyses of public RNA-seq data sets demonstrates higher Sig15 expression in DLBCL cells compared to normal B cells. Western blot shows higher Sig15 expression in lymphoma cell lines compared to PBMC. IHC of a tumor microarray and validation samples from children shows high Sig15 expression in NHL samples with distinct staining patterns based on subtype. Specifically, Sig15 appears to be highly expressed and associated with the cell membrane in most DLBCL and Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma, with more variable expression in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, primarily in the cytoplasm at low levels and\/or in cells with morphology consistent with macrophages. In addition, preliminary data suggest more than one isoform of Sig15, raising the possibility of alternative functions. Lastly, knockdown of Sig15 in A20 cells abrogates disease progression in immune competent but not immune deficient recipients, consistent with a role for Sig15 in immune evasion in lymphoma. Together, these data implicate Sig15 as an immune checkpoint that may be inhibited therapeutically to promote an immune response to lymphoma cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/00e138da-33b5-4610-9dbc-3a6a410e4972\/@D03B8ZKU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,Siglec-15,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11692"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dailia B.

Indeed, epidemiological, genetic, and bioinformatic studies have shown multiple degrees of defects in the PARK2 gene, localized in human chromosome 6q25-27, a region frequently lost in cancers. In the present study, we show a novel role of Parkin in tumor immune surveillance through dysregulation of the PTEN\/PI3k\/AKT pathway, involving the modulation of antigen presentation machinery and antitumor-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell reactivity. We generated murine and human models that resemble the advanced-stage tumors where Parkin deficiencies are mostly found. In the mouse models, we observed a striking increase of tumor aggressiveness in the absence of Parkin that was associated with loss of antigen presentation and a significant decrease in the infiltration of antitumor CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Importantly, loss of PARK2 also affected the efficacy of a Tumor-Associated Mitochondria Antigens (TAMAs) based vaccine showing the crucial role of Parkin in tumor development and in the context of antitumor cellular therapeutic strategies. Moreover, we also found that the lack of Parkin in the B16-OVA melanoma model also negatively impacts cytosol-derived antigen presentation and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell immunity. Finally, the analysis of TCGA tumor atlas validates the relevance of PARK2 loss on cancer immunotherapy effectiveness. Thus, during the progression and immunotherapy of cancer, the presence of Parkin mutations that result in loss of its functionality impact antigen presentation and facilitate tumor evasion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7aaf2ea6-43b9-49ea-9fb3-c47141ddd616\/@D03B8ZKU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Antigen presentation,Mitochondria,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11720"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Renzo Perales Linares<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hesham Mohei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nektaria M.

However, the macrophage plasticity can lead to different outcomes of tumor progression and the amino acid, arginine, plays a central role in macrophage dichotomy. The exact role of arginine on the management of macrophage polarization is not completely understood. We have discovered that a methylated arginine metabolite, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), serves as an important regulator of macrophage functions. Upon stimulation by ADMA, macrophages have reduced survival and show a delayed tumor-phagocytic capacity. Additionally, ADMA blocks the Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) but not the Arginase activity in macrophages leading to a tendency of M2-like phenotype polarization. ADMA has minor effect on tumor cell proliferation but significantly drives the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Tumor cells, particularly the tumor stem cells, are the major sources of ADMA. Production and secretion of ADMA by tumor (stem) cells profoundly increase when co-cultured with activated T cells or treated with T cell associated inflammatory cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-r). IFN-r initiates autophagy of tumor (stem) cells and inhibition of autophagy reduces the output of ADMA by tumor (stem) cells. Similarly, IFN-r enhances the proteasomal degradation and inhibition of the proteasomal pathway also reduces the ADMA production induced by IFN-r. In summary, our work shows that tumor (stem) cells may escape from immune surveillance (such as their exposure to activated T lymphocytes or to cytotoxic cytokine, IFN-r) through the secretion of ADMA generated via both autophagic and proteasomal pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9792df65-8b77-4a79-9212-8a1b6f27f960\/@D03B8ZKU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Autophagy,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11721"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yiling Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>AKaychia T.

There are currently few therapeutic options to prevent or treat leptomeningeal disease (LMD), in part due to our limited knowledge of the molecular pathways involved in tumor invasion and survival within this unique niche. Here we show that BCCs in mice can bypass the restrictive blood-brain barrier and invade the LM by migrating along the abluminal surface of emissary vessels that connect the vertebral\/calvarial bone marrow and meninges. This is mediated by tumor cell integrin &#945;6 engaging extracellular matrix laminin on the vascular basement membrane. Upon invasion of the LM, BCCs co-localize with CSF1R+ meningeal macrophages\/microglia in the perivascular space. We demonstrate that ablation of these myeloid cells by CSF1R inhibition leads to prolonged disease-free survival due to decreased LMD burden. Importantly, we show that CSF1R+ cell depletion does not prevent tumor cell LM colonization, but instead limits disease expansion within the LM, highlighting the pro-tumor phenotype of these meningeal macrophages\/microglia. Our data suggest that meningeal macrophages\/microglia support BCC proliferation\/survival by up-regulating glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a key neurotrophic factor released by macrophages\/microglia in response to neuronal injury. <i>In vitro<\/i>, GDNF protects BCCs from cell death induced by glucose deprivation, suggesting that tumor cells may hijack a macrophage neuronal injury response program to thrive within the nutrient-poor LM niche. Unexpectedly, we found that integrin &#945;6 deletion or antibody blockade eliminates the protective role of GDNF by modulating GDNF\/NCAM receptor signaling in BCCs. Taken together, our data suggest that BCCs co-opt neuronal pathfinding mechanisms and resident macrophages\/glia to efficiently invade and thrive within the LM niche. Integrin &#945;6 appears to be a master regulator of this neuronal mimicry through its ability to promote abluminal vessel trafficking and mediate responsiveness to GDNF.

Its common complications are thrombosis and second primary malignancies. Secreted from virtually all cell types, exosomes are extracellular vesicles that carry bioactive cargo derived from their cells of origin. When engulfed, their cargo may alter the phenotype of the recipient cells. For example, neoplastic exosomes modulate the cellular makeup of bystander cells. Therefore, since mutated JAK2 is present in virtually all PV-patients, we hypothesize<b> <\/b>that PV-derived exosomes (hereafter PV-exo) carry the mutated JAK2 oncogene and are taken up by non-clonal cells, thus contributing to the thrombotic manifestations and oncogenic potential of patients with PV. We isolated and characterized exosomes from PV-patients and from the Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line (hereafter HEL-exo). We exposed normal cells implicated in thrombosis and skin cells to these exosomes and examined the cells' phenotypic changes and activation after exposure. Using Sanger sequencing we discovered that both PV-exo and HEL-exo, like their parental cells, carry the mutated JAK2 transcripts, allowing clonal cells to export oncogenes to distant, non-clonal sites. Our preliminary findings suggest that these exosomes promote pro-coagulant and malignant phenotypes in multiple ways. Thrombin generation assay pointed to a significantly higher generation of thrombin in the presence of PV-exo than those derived from healthy donors. Similarly, flow cytometry analysis revealed that PV-exo increased the expression of platelet activation markers. Moreover, Trans Endothelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) assay results suggest that HEL-exo induces endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, using the Sulforhodamine B assay, we found that exposure to HEL-exo increased the proliferation of normal keratinocytes. In summary, we developed the concept of exosomes as &#8220;mini metastasis&#8221; that might promote disease manifestations either directly or indirectly. Since unlike solid tumors, hematological malignancies do not metastasize, exosomes derived from neoplastic hematological cells may fulfill this function. Such exosomes may spread oncogenes (e.g., mutated JAK2), damage non-clonal tissues (e.g., endothelial dysfunction) or act as a miniature reflection of their cells of origin (e.g., exosomes as mini platelets) in a parallel way to \"real\" metastasis; this concept may affect treatment related decisions. For example, by reducing clonal burden, early treatment even in &#8220;low risk&#8221; patients may prevent exosomal spread and exosomal-dependent damage to distant tissues. The results of our study highlight PV-exo as promoters of PV-complications, thrombosis and malignant transformation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71e350d7-b420-484c-802e-e5762583125c\/@D03B8ZKU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Endothelial cells,Microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11725"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Orit Uziel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adi Shacham-Abulafia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Galia Spectre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ester Ziv<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karyn Revital Geiger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zinab Sarsor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neria Ron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Einat Beery<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pia Raanani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shoshana Revel-Vilk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mira Naamad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uri Rozovski<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently described clonal expansion (CE) of mutant skin and esophagus suggests CE is pervasive across tissues. Immune evasion and angiogenesis, reliant on the microenvironment (ME), are cancer hallmarks, yet ME changes in the setting of CE have not been systematically studied. Using GTEX RNA-Seq data (25 normal tissues, n = 6,511), previously reported somatic variants (Yizhak K, Science 2019) and normalized gene expression values were downloaded. Samples were grouped by the presence of: non-synonymous mutation (NSM) in a COSMIC Cancer Gene Census gene (CGC-m), NSM in a non-cancer gene or no NSM (non-m). ME scores, i.e. stromal and immune cell abundances for all samples, were estimated using Xcell and CIBERSORTx. Our analyses focused on tissues with at least 10 CGC-m, especially skin and esophagus which had the most CGC-m cases (77\/600, 12% and 166\/512, 32% respectively; median :4.6%). We also compared ME scores from skin and esophagus with corresponding cancer data from TCGA. Differential gene expression (DEG) testing between CGC-m and non-m samples, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and hypoxia scores (Bhandari V, Nature Comm 2020) based on findings (below) were generated. ME scores significantly differed in the CGC-m vs. non-m cohorts, with increased epithelial and lymphatic endothelial cells (skin, esophagus), megakaryocytes (skin, prostate) and neutrophils (prostate, lung) (Wilcoxon FDR p-value &#60; 0.01). Skin showed reduced fibroblasts and esophagus, increased endothelial cells and melanocytes and lower pericytes and erythrocytes. Comparing TCGA and GTEX data, melanoma showed similar but more marked epithelial cell increase and fibroblast reduction. Esophageal carcinoma showed similar but more pronounced reductions in pericytes and erythrocytes. DEG testing between CGC-m and non-m identified: in esophagus, overexpression of genes aberrant in carcinomas (<i>ERBB2<\/i>, <i>CDH1<\/i>, <i>SOX2<\/i> and<i> TP63<\/i>; p-adjusted &#60; 0.01), downregulation of pro-angiogenic factors and those involved in pericyte recruitment (<i>FGF2<\/i>, <i>ANGPT1<\/i> and <i>PDGFB<\/i>); in skin, extracellular matrix protein, <i>ELN<\/i> was overexpressed. GSEA analysis of differentially expressed genes identified dysregulation of mesenchymal-epithelial transition and myogenesis pathways in both tissues and angiogenesis-related pathway in esophagus. Hypoxia scores were markedly higher in CGC-m vs. non-m esophagus samples (Wilcoxon FDR p-value &#60; 0.01). These results suggest ME alterations participate in initial stages of cancer progression and are tissue-specific. High hypoxia scores support a hypothesis of its early initiating role in CE-related angiogenesis in esophagus. Studying these changes may reveal novel avenues for early cancer intervention, immune or other targeted therapies and enhancement of conventional therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/314c5e85-1eab-4153-9047-1aa7e3ea6027\/@D03B8ZKU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Clonal evolution,Angiogenesis,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11727"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chetan Munugala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jieting Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eirini Christodoulou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Venkata Yellapantula<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

SMW causes significant progressive muscle loss, weakness, and fatigue. SMW in patients adversely affects quality of life during and results in a severely reduced ability of patients to tolerate chemotherapeutic drugs. Chemotherapy itself also exacerbates SMW in patients. There are currently no effective therapies for SMW. This condition is rarely reported in patient records and is often overlooked in patients with a high body mass index. Although this condition is associated with significantly lower survival rates compared to patients with relatively normal muscle mass, we do not yet understand the molecular mechanism by which it occurs in breast cancer patients. In this study, we investigate the role that CCL2 plays in breast cancer and chemotherapy induced SMW. CCL2 is a chemokine that regulates recruitment of immune cells to sites of injury and inflammation. CCL2 is overexpressed in breast cancer and SMW has been linked to elevated levels of CCL2. CCL2 overexpression is also associated with high mortality rates in breast cancer patients. To investigate the role of CCL2 in muscle wasting we treated C2C12 mouse muscle cells with increasing concentrations of CCL2. This led to increased expression of markers of muscle degradation, MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1, with reduced muscle cell proliferation and muscle cell size. This indicates that high levels of CCL2 cause muscle degradation. Using an MDA-MB-231 model of breast cancer, we show that CCL2 knockdown in the primary breast tumor decreases the expression of muscle degradation markers. Further experiments using the 4T1 mammary tumor model show that mice in which CCL2 was knocked down exhibited greater grip strength than those mice in which CCL2 levels remained unaltered. Therefore, CCL2 knockdown reduces muscle degradation and increases grip strength in a mouse model of breast cancer. We also investigated the effect of chemotherapy on SMW. Preliminary in vitro data shows increased expression of CCL2 in response to chemotherapy treatment, while in vivo experiments using the 4T1 breast tumor model indicate that chemotherapeutic treatment also significantly reduces grip strength in mice. Our findings suggest that we can improve patient survival rates and quality of life by developing therapies to combat muscle loss during and after treatment. Understanding the mechanism of muscle wasting is necessary to provide insight into novel, targeted therapeutics to reduce SMW and enhance effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6dbb64a4-208f-499d-8084-364ac88e3980\/@E03B8ZKV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Mouse models,Cachexia,CCL2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11728"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nadia Alissa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Bin Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gage Brummer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcela Mitchell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Thyfault<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paige Geiger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikki Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

The standard treatment consists in tumor resection followed by chemo- and radio- therapy. However, tumor recurrence still remains inevitable, and the average lifespan of patients is only 15 months. Over the past decades, targeted therapies such as anti-angiogenic therapy, were proposed but failed to improve overall survival. In this context, the identification of new therapeutic targets is fundamental to implement current treatments. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPs) are known to be involved in oncogenesis in several types of cancer, including GBM. Oncogenic properties of PRL2 has been demonstrated in different tumors (e.g. leukemia, breast, lung and nasopharyngeal cancer), but no evidence of PRL2 involvement in GBM has been reported so far. The aim of this project is to understand the role of PRL2 in GBM development, in order to evaluate the potential of PRL2 inhibition as a new therapeutic strategy. <b> <\/b> Analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) dataset revealed that PRL2 was a poor prognostic factor in gliomas, and its expression correlated GBM aggressiveness. <i>PTP4A2<\/i> expression also correlated with expression of genes involved in immune responses, reactive oxygen species, actin cytoskeleton and trafficking. Thus, we oriented our work towards these directions. To study PRL2 effects both in brain tumor cells and microenvironment, we used spheroids of patient-derived GBM cells, in which <i>PTP4A2<\/i> expression was modulated. <i>In vitro<\/i> assays showed that migration, invasion and adhesion abilities were increased in <i>PTP4A2<\/i>-KO cells but cell proliferation was not affected. Next, in orthotopic xenografts experiments, PRL2 over-expression promoted tumor growth and reduced mouse survival rate. In addition, to overcome PRLs functional compensation and to use a clinically relevant strategy, we targeted all PRLs (PRL1, 2 and 3) activity with an inhibitory compound. Inhibiting all PRLs drastically reduced viability of GBM cells. <b> <\/b> Our project aims at discovering how PRL2 is involved in the progression and tumor microenvironment of GBM. Our results indicate that PRL2 promotes GBM growth in response to microenvironmental pressure and its inhibition improves mouse outcomes. However, the precise mechanisms of this regulation are still under investigation. Targeting PRLs and particularly PRL2 open avenue for therapeutic strategy in GBM treatment. <b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8e8b39c0-3d1f-436b-b183-d8a4dd7472bc\/@E03B8ZKV\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase,,Tumor growth,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11729"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tiffanie Chouleur<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie-Alix Derieppe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wilfried Souleyreau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michel L.
