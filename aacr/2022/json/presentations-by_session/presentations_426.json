[{"Abstract":"Currently, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is mainly treated with conventional therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, and patients often suffer from the lack of second line therapy options. In this study, we aimed to identify efficacious drug combinations in primary MPM patient samples and novel MPM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to provide better therapeutic options for MPM patients. BH3 profiling is a functional assay that measures mitochondrial priming of the cell. It uses BH3 peptides derived from the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family members to provoke a response from viable mitochondria. When tumor cells are treated with drugs prior to BH3 profiling, early changes in their apoptosis signaling can be captured before frank apoptosis occurs. This method is termed dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), which has been applied in multiple cancer types to identify efficacious drugs. Here, we used high throughput dynamic BH3 profiling (HTDBP) to assess hundreds of drug treatments simultaneously to identify drug combinations that increased apoptotic priming in primary MPM cells <i>ex vivo<\/i>. Next, we created novel MPM PDX models and tested these drug combinations to determine the ones that primed MPM PDX cells. The HTDBP result from MPM PDX cells recapitulated the chemical vulnerabilities of the primary MPM cells. Moreover, one of the top combination candidates that comprised of navitoclax (BCL-xL, BCL-2 and BCL-w antagonist) and AZD8055 (mTORC1\/2 inhibitor) was shown to be safe and efficacious <i>in vivo<\/i> in our CPDM_011x MPM PDX model. Finally, on the molecular level, we revealed that treatment with navitoclax drove the anti-apoptotic dependence of MPM cell lines towards MCL-1, whose level was downregulated by AZD8055 treatment. In this study, we identified a novel drug combination for MPM with HTDBP that consists of navitoclax and AZD8055. In addition, our results further corroborated that DBP, as a functional assay, can be used to rationally construct novel drug combinations to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/24044c40-4138-46d6-a7b9-c682634d26cb\/@B03B8ZK6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Mesothelioma,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13747"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Danielle S.

Treatment remains a major challenge of this disease and these poor outcomes have researchers targeting the tumor microenvironment for therapy. The diagnosis and therapeutic options remain an obstacle due to the immune system response and associated non- specific symptoms. Immunotherapy is an important treatment for pancreatic cancer, and its applications are currently being studied. Targeting T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells could be a potential strategy. Due to the behavior of pancreatic cancer and the tumor microenvironment, immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid - derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells limit the efficacy of T cell infiltration. The cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) plays an essential role to regulate both innate (natural killer cells) and adaptive (cytokine T-lymphocytes) immunities in cancer therapies. IL-12 is composed of two subunits, p40 and p35. We found that various human pancreatic cancer cells produce greater levels of p40 monomer and p40 homodimer (p40<sub>2<\/sub>), than IL-12, and IL-23. We further demonstrate that selective neutralization of p40 by p40 mAb (a3-3a), by p40<sub>2 <\/sub>mAb<sub> <\/sub>(d7-12c) stimulated death in pancreatic cancer cells. Our studies aim to identify the roles of p40 and p40<sub>2<\/sub> in pancreatic cancer cells and underlie the importance of p40 monomer and p40 homodimer in helping cancer cells escape cell death.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/614a18e9-6b58-4c9a-8e20-461dd69b8c97\/@B03B8ZK6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,T cell,Interleukin-12,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13751"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Monica Sheinin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13), which was newly identified as a liver lipid droplet associated protein, was recently found to be down-regulated in HCC. However, the effects of HSD17B13 on the underlying mechanisms of HCC have not yet been fully explored. For this purpose, HSD17B13 gene was knockdown with CRISPER\/Cas9 technique in several HCC cell lines. HSD17B13 expression was detected by Flow cytometry and Western blotting with recombinant rabbit monoclonal antibodies (clone OTIR3G2 and OTIR5C10) against HSD17B13 which were screened for use in immunohistochemistry, western blot, and ELISA application. Overexpressed HSD17B13 induces hepatic cell line G1 capture and increases several G1 arrest-related protein expression, including p21, p27, MMP2 and MMP3. Then the proliferation and cell cycle were suppressed. HSD17B13 gene knockdown will reverse the suppression. These data indicated that HSD17B13 play important roles in the progression of HCC lesions.

These anti-apoptotic proteins prevent caspase-mediated cell apoptosis by binding to the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM, BAK and BAX, thereby inhibiting the formation of pores on the outer mitochondrial membrane. In cancer, MCL1 is upregulated to overcome such stress-induced effects, promoting cell survival, therapy resistance, and tumor progression. Here, we describe the in vitro and in vivo activity of GS-9716, a potent and selective MCL1 small molecule inhibitor that binds directly to MCL1 and induces rapid apoptosis in cancer cells by activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. GS-9716 displayed potent and selective disruption of human MCL1-BIM protein dimer in vitro. In hematological and solid tumor cell line models, GS-9716 led to dose dependent reduction of MCL1-BIM and MCL1-BAK protein dimers. MCL1 protein dimer (BAK and BIM) reduction correlated with dose-dependent increases in cleaved caspase (apoptosis marker). GS-9716 potently reduced cellular viability across panels of hematological (Median GI<sub>50<\/sub> = 30 nM) and breast cancer cell lines (Median GI<sub>50<\/sub> = 470 nM). GS-9716 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetics properties with good oral bioavailability across species.<i> <\/i>GS-9716 dosed daily, once per week, or 7-day cycles of 2 days on\/5 days off, resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition against models of multiple myeloma (H929), several TNBC cell line xenografts (HCC1187 and HCC70) and patient-derived xenografts. Also, in these models, GS-9716 demonstrated dose-dependent MCL1 protein dimer (BIM and BAK) reduction and activation of apoptosis in tumors. In addition to single agent activity, GS-9716 showed strong synergy with multiple anti-cancer therapies; robust in vitro synergy was observed with venetoclax in the AML models and as well as with paclitaxel in the TNBC models. The combination treatment of paclitaxel (dosed IV, QW) with GS-9716 (dosed orally, 2 days on\/5 days off) in the TNBC HCC1187 xenograft model achieved complete tumor regression. Similar responses were also observed when GS-9716 was dosed with paclitaxel in the TNBC PDX models. GS-9716 is currently in Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics as monotherapy and in combination with anticancer therapies in adults with advanced solid tumors (NCT05006794).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86dc3ad8-e213-4c71-af85-9faf2111b526\/@B03B8ZK6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-03 Bcl-2 family proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mcl-1,Bcl-2 protein family,Apoptosis,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13753"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Clinton K.

However, EGFR inhibition is mainly cytostatic and does not lead to tumor eradication: subsets of drug-tolerant cancer cells often persist even after maximal response to therapy and foster residual disease, leading to relapse. Importantly, drug-tolerant cells are less prone to undergo apoptosis, and thus constitute a reservoir of treatment-refractory persisters that are difficult to extinguish. Here we aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which apoptosis escape mediates survival of cetuximab-tolerant mCRC cells as a means to find new therapeutic strategies for limiting residual disease and delaying disease recurrence. By performing an innovative functional assay named Dynamic BH3 Profiling<sup> <\/sup>in cetuximab-sensitive patient-derived organoids (PDOs), we found that antibody treatment increased the &#8220;apoptotic priming&#8221;, i.e. decreased the distance of cells from the apoptotic threshold without eliciting overt cell death. To start investigating the mechanisms of this increased apoptotic priming, protein levels of the major anti-apoptotic molecules (BCL2, BCL-XL, MCL1) and the pro-apoptotic molecule BIM were evaluated by Western blot in cetuximab-treated PDOs. BIM was consistently upregulated by cetuximab in all tested models. Increased BIM was sequestered by the anti-apoptotic BCL-XL, suggesting that EGFR blockade may render mCRC residual cells dependent on BCL-XL to elude cell death and, consequently, more susceptible to its inhibition. We therefore challenged a panel of 14 PDOs with different BH3 mimetics currently in preclinical or clinical development and found that only the combination of cetuximab with BH3 mimetics against BCL-XL strongly reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis. BCL-XL blockade enhanced cetuximab efficacy also in mCRC patient-derived xenografts, which displayed more durable tumor regression that was maintained also after treatment discontinuation. Notably, the combination of cetuximab with BCL-XL inhibitors was effective <i>in vivo<\/i> in all tested models except for one, which was characterized by low basal expression of BIM. Mechanistically, unleashed apoptosis by combination therapy was due to cetuximab-induced BIM upregulation concomitantly with its displacement from BCL-XL by the BH3 mimetic. Overall, this study offers new insights into the molecular mechanisms assisting residual disease after cetuximab treatment in mCRC, providing hints to design rational strategies that may convert the cytostatic effect of cetuximab into a cytotoxic, fully apoptotic outcome. Basal expression of BIM could be exploited as a predictive biomarker to enrich for potential responders to the combination of cetuximab and BH3 mimetics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6cffa492-198c-4a32-a84b-4d9790fe8f4a\/@C03B8ZK7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-03 Bcl-2 family proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Targeted therapy,Bcl-2 protein family,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13754"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Simonetta Maria Leto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Catalano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Ferri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Vurchio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Cottino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eugenia Rosalinda Zanella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Sassi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgia Migliardi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Bertotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Livio Trusolino<\/i><\/presenter>.

We evaluated interactions of UBE4B with the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH\/AIP4 and the effects of UBE4B expression on Ku70, c-FLIPL, and p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blots. We also evaluated the role of UBE4B in apoptosis induced by HDAC inhibition in our neuroblastoma cell lines model using Western blots. UBE4B was found in a complex with ITCH, with binding mediated by WW domains in the ITCH protein. ITCH activation led to ITCH-UBE4B E3-E4 ubiquitin ligase complex formation and recruitment of Ku70 and c-FLIPL via ITCH WW domains, followed by Ku70 and c-FLIPL Lys48\/Lys63 branched polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition induced Ku70 and c-FLIPL acetylation, leading to release of c-FLIPL and Bax from Ku70, increased Ku70 and c-FLIPL Lys48\/Lys63 branched polyubiquitination via the ITCH-UBE4B complex, and induction of apoptosis. UBE4B depletion in our neuroblastoma cell lines model led to reduced polyubiquitination and increased levels of Ku70 and c-FLIPL proteins leading to the massive reduction of apoptosis induced by HDAC inhibition via stabilization of Ku70 and c-FLIPL proteins allowing the inhibition of the full caspase 8 activation. Our results have identified novel interactions and novel targets for UBE4B ubiquitin ligase activity and a direct role of the ITCH-UBE4B complex in responses of neuroblastoma cells to HDAC inhibition, suggesting that the ITCH-UBE4B complex plays a critical role in responses of neuroblastoma to therapy and suggesting a potential mechanism underlying the association of UBE4B expression with neuroblastoma patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b8f31abd-e132-48dd-a539-5ffd8432085a\/@C03B8ZK7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Ubiquitination,Apoptosis,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13770"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christophe Le Clorennec<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Divya Subramonian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuchen Huo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter E.

As a critical step of intrinsic apoptosis, pro-apoptotic effector Bcl-2 proteins BAX, BAK and BOK form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) which causes Cytochrome C release, followed by caspase-activation and ultimately cell death. In contrast to BAK and BOK, BAX mainly resides in the cytosol and translocates to mitochondria when activated by pro-apoptotic signals. During activation and translocation, BAX undergoes conformational changes including dislodging of the c-terminal &#945;-9 helix from the hydrophobic groove and insertion in the MOM. Most studies concerning BAX activation focus on the interaction of the BH3 domain and the hydrophobic groove, which is essential for BAX inhibition by members of the Bcl-2 family. In contrast, how modifications of the &#945;-9 transmembrane domain (TMD) can impair BAX inhibition and membrane insertion remains understudied so far, so that functional roles of the TMD in BAX activation and translocation are yet to be defined. To determine the role of the BAX-TMD in activation and translocation, we generated several plasmids encoding for BAX chimeras in which the original BAX-TMD sequence was swapped for TMDs of other Bcl-2 proteins. The chimeric BAX proteins were expressed in human cell lines and cell death as well as protein localisation was investigated. Surprisingly, we found that swapping the BAX-TMD for another effector TMD increases BAX pro-apoptotic activity assessed via Annexin-V staining and flow cytometry. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed that BAX shows an increased tendency to mitochondrial localisation and oligomerisation when bearing TMDs of BAK or BOK. Interestingly, co-expressed anti-apoptotic BCL-2 an antagonistic binding-partner of BAX co-localises with BAX chimeras but poorly prevents cell death induced by the BAX chimera with the BAK-TMD. These findings strongly support a crucial regulatory role of the BAX-TMD in activation and translocation. In fact, the increased apoptotic potential of the BAX-TMD chimeras as well as augmented mitochondrial localisation suggest an auto-inhibitory function of the BAX-TMD ensured by its affinity to the BAX hydrophobic groove. Moreover, the decreased inhibitory capacity of Bcl-2 for the BAK-TMD-containing BAX chimera could point to an involvement of the BAX-TMD in interaction with BCL-2. In contrast to the archetypical understanding of the TMD as a mere membrane anchor, these results also indicate that the TMD can regulate the activity of BAX and other Bcl-2 family proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b44de934-adb3-4054-ba1b-c2fe388dfe5f\/@C03B8ZK7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-03 Bcl-2 family proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Bcl-2 protein family,Bax,Transmembrane domain,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13772"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tobias Benjamin Beigl<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Weller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Schäfer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Walter Erich Aulitzky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hans-Georg Kopp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markus Rehm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Essmann<\/i><\/presenter>.

As recently shown, ABT-199 and Bortezomib (BTZ) synergistically induce apoptosis in STS derived cells and cell lines (Muenchow et al. 2020). This is of great importance due to limited clinical therapeutic options and lower dependence on BCL-2 expression in solid cancers. To delineate the molecular basis for the synergism of ABT-199 and BTZ, we thought to elucidate the mechanism leading to enhanced expression of the BH3-only protein NOXA. We investigated whether proteasome inhibition augmented the expression of NOXA in a TP53-regulated manner. To clarify a possible role of TP53 in increased NOXA expression, we performed knock-down of <i>TP53<\/i> and analyzed transcription of <i>PMAIP1<\/i> by qRT-PCR and expression of NOXA protein by Western Blot in presence of ABT-199 alone and in combination with BTZ. Previous reports also show that ABT-199 impairs complex I and II activity of the electron transport chain (ETC), resulting in induction of metabolic reprogramming confirmed by enhanced reductive carboxylation (Roca-Portoles et al. 2020). The ratio of &#945;-ketoglutarate : citrate, indicating disbalance of the ETC, was assessed by mass spectrometric analysis in SW982\/WT cells after incubation with ABT-199 alone and in combination with BTZ. Moreover, we gained further insight into the molecular mechanism of action of enhanced NOXA expression by analyzing ABT&#8209;199 and BTZ induced cell death induction in time kinetics of cell death induction in knock-down experiments using CellTOX Green as indicator. We found that ABT&#8209;199 induced the expression of NOXA by a mainly TP53-independent mechanism at the transcriptional level. Indeed, our data suggest that ABT-199 induces metabolic reprogramming leading to enhanced reductive carboxylation, evidenced by an increased ratio of &#945;&#8209;ketoglutarate : citrate. Subsequent activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) induces expression of the known ISR markers ATF3 and ATF4 at both the transcriptional and protein levels. Silencing of <i>ATF3 <\/i>and <i>ATF4<\/i> significantly reduced NOXA expression and NOXA mediated cell death induction. Therefore, we propose that transactivation of NOXA by ABT-199 and subsequent sensitization to proteasome inhibitors effectively induces cell death in solid cancers. The double impact of ABT-199 by i) directly blocking anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and ii) inhibiting MCL-1 via transactivated NOXA is of high clinical relevance, because combined treatment with proteasome inhibitors might overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance to BH3-mimetics. Thus, the here described novel effect of ABT-199 to transactivate NOXA expression, should prompt future efforts in the clinical evaluation of combinatorial regimens in additional malignancies. We hypothesize that these effects represent generally active principles of a tumor-agnostic mechanism of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c6c326fc-95a4-46f8-8fdd-6de6469c0df4\/@C03B8ZK7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Bcl-2 protein family,Signaling pathways,Synergism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13774"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sandra Weller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Schaefer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias B.

There are three isoforms of VDAC, that are structurally and functionally conserved as far as their ion transport function is concerned. However, there are isoform-specific functions that support distinct pathways. For VDAC2 isoform, an established isoform-specific function is the targeting of the pro-apoptotic Bak protein to the OMM, which stabilizes Bak, leading to its elevated cellular levels. On the surface of OMM, activation and oligomerization of Bak and Bax, another pro-apoptotic protein leads to OMM perforation and release of pro-apoptotic proteins from intermembrane space to the cytoplasm. This is an irreversible step that stimulates the downstream events of apoptotic pathway. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks third in cancer mortality and in the advanced stages is associated with poor prognosis. We observed that unexpectedly, HCC cells are vastly more sensitive to tBid induced apoptosis compared to normal hepatocytes. tBid is a BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, the effect of which is primarily mediated by Bak. We have shown that, in the absence of VDAC2, the Bid-Bak apoptosis pathway is suppressed. VDAC2 protein expression is the lowest in liver and lung among different tissues. We also determined the protein abundances in the HCC lines and normal hepatocytes and found elevated VDAC2 and Bak levels in HCC. Our findings are in line with multiple datasets that show an elevation of VDAC2\/Bak expression in human HCC suggesting a potential clinical relevance. We found that combination of an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic proteins (S63845, a selective Mcl-1 inhibitor), which normally suppresses Bak activation, with an activator of the tBid pathway (TRAIL) enhanced the death of hepatocarcinoma cells with little effect on normal hepatocytes. This treatment strategy was also effective at reducing tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>, but only in tumors expressing VDAC2. Thus, we postulate that increased VDAC2 expression in HCC leads to elevated Bak recruitment to the OMM, which in turn sensitizes HCC to tBid. Therefore, this differential expression provides an excellent opportunity for selective elimination of HCC cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/161a067f-2384-4c9f-8051-6abfd1d8efec\/@C03B8ZK7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Apoptosis,Mitochondria,TRAIL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13784"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Piyush Mishra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Using the iOTarg screening platform, salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) was identified as a novel epigenetic modulator in cancer therapy. SIK3, a serine\/threonine kinase of the AMP-activated protein kinase family, is known for regulating the NF-&#954;B driven gene landscape through phosphorylation of class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators causing the tumor to evade death receptor-mediated killing. Moreover, salt inducible kinases were recently described to regulate cell cycle checkpoints and thereby promote cancer cell proliferation. We demonstrate that SIK3 knockdown abates downstream pro-survival signaling and induces cell death in a distinct panel of tumor cell lines. OMX-0407, an orally available, single-digit nanomolar inhibitor of SIK3 was shown to effectively reduce TNF-induced HDAC4 phosphorylation and downstream NF-&#954;B activity in a dose-dependent manner, thereby enhancing apoptosis in murine and human tumor cell lines. OMX-0407 dose-dependent suppression of intratumoral NF-&#954;B activity was shown <i>in vivo<\/i> in an MC38 NF-&#954;B-luc reporter cell line. Using OMX-0407 monotherapy, this translated to significant tumor growth inhibition as well as prolonged survival in the highly immune infiltrated syngeneic murine colorectal carcinoma model MC38. Besides its direct inhibitory effects on cancer cells, OMX-0407 repolarizes the tumor microenvironment (TME) by strongly decreasing regulatory T cells (T-regs) and M2-polarized macrophages in the tumor bed, while not affecting the peripheral T cell compartment. Thus, exposure to OMX-0407 leads to a distinct pro-inflammatory TME, characterized by an expansion of activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and an increased CTL-to-T-reg ratio. Using an immune-excluded tumor phenotype as seen in the breast cancer mouse model EMT6, we demonstrated that OMX-0407 and anti-PD-1 act synergistically by combining the sensitization towards cell death with a reduction in immunosuppressive TME and an increase in cytotoxic T cell activity, despite having only minimal anti-tumor efficacy as monotherapy. Thereby, partial or complete tumor remission in 60% of the animals and extension of overall survival were achieved. In summary, OMX-0407, a first-in-class oral SIK3 inhibitor, demonstrates potent monotherapy efficacy in a pro-inflammatory tumor setting by reshaping the immune compartment and accelerating tumor cell death. The ability of OMX-0407 to remodel an immunosuppressed TME in a generally cold tumor setting, harbors great clinical potential for OMX-0407 combination therapy with anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade, specifically in patients with high unmet medical need who are resistant to current immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5bd60ff1-a5e2-45d5-b7cf-3af999aef337\/@C03B8ZK7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell death,SIK3 Inhibitor,TME repolarization,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13785"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Christina Hartl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilona-Petra Maser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tillmann Michels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronny Milde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanessa Klein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Beckhove<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nisit Khandelwal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannes Loferer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Stefan Bissinger<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>. iOmx Therapeutics AG, Martinsried \/ Munich, Germany, Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, Regensburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6928f66a-40b8-4673-8564-3d30f8eb8046","ControlNumber":"4340","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

A major underlying cause of the resistance is the evasion of cell death following anti-cancer drug treatment. A great deal of progress has been made in the discovery and early development of cancer therapeutics that target cell death via the intrinsic or extrinsic cell death pathways. Two such drugs are ABT-263 and ONC201. ABT-263 is a small molecule that targets the pro-apoptotic cell death of tumor cells by blocking the anti-apoptotic function of BCL-XL and BCL-2; ONC201\/TIC10 is a first-in-class small molecule originally discovered as a TRAIL-inducing compound. Previous studies have found that a mechanism of resistance to ABT-263 involves upregulation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 in ABT-263-treated tumors, while the efficacy of ONC201 is limited by BCL-2 overexpression. Given that ONC201 is known to downregulate Mcl-1 expression and that BCL-2 is a target of ABT-263, the combination of the two drugs has great synergistic potential. ONC201 and ABT-263 been tested in glioblastoma; however, ABT-263 is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and the combination of ONC201 and ABT-263 has not been tested in other solid tumors. It remains a gap in the field to test this combination therapy in tissues to which ONC201 and ABT-263 are bioavailable. We explored the combination of TRAIL-inducing compound ONC201\/TIC10 and BCL-xl\/BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-263 to target the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, respectively, in solid tumor cell lines (N=13) derived from different tissues (colon, prostate, lung, breast, ovary, bladder). We found an IC50 range of 0.83-20.10 &#956;M for ONC201 and 0.06-14.75 &#956;M for ABT-263 among the 13 cell lines. We show that combination of ONC201 and ABT-263 produces a strong synergistic effect leading to tumor cell death across the 1cell line panel, with maximum synergy scores ranging from 13.56-52.23 (scores were calculated using SynergyFinder; scores 0-10 indicate additive effects, while scores &#38;gt;10 indicate synergism), and that the combination is not toxic to human fibroblast cells. We also found that the combination of these two agents resulted in caspase activation and PARP cleavage consistent with induction of apoptosis, and that these effects where over and above individual drug effects. Combination therapy-induced cell death correlated with decreased levels of Mcl-1, BAG3, pAkt, and upregulation of Noxa along with Bax cleavage during apoptosis. Our data provide evidence for synergy from the combination of ONC201 and ABT-263 against human solid tumor cell lines associated with alterations in cell death and pro-survival mediators. The combination of ONC201 and ABT-263 merits further exploration <i>in vivo<\/i> in a variety of solid malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b1690f6-b483-493a-9a8b-1f24e93a9b66\/@C03B8ZK7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Drug synergy,ABT-263,ONC201,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13786"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Francesca R.

So far, there are no recommended screening tests for the early detection of ovarian cancer. Therefore, patients are frequently diagnosed at late stages of ovarian cancer, which is associated with unfavorable 5-year survival. Patients suffering from ovarian cancer often show a good response to initial therapy with platinum-based compounds and\/or taxanes subsequent to resection of the affected tissue. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer shows a high frequency of relapse and after chemotherapy persistent tumor cells re-expand and successively evolve into therapy-resistant tumors.<br \/>We recently reported that cisplatin (<i>cis<\/i>Pt) treatment of ovarian cancer cells enhances mitochondrial content and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (Kleih et al. 2019). We therefore speculated that the enhanced mitochondrial content primes <i>cis<\/i>Pt-treated cells for apoptosis induced by BH3 mimetic drugs, such as Venetoclax (ABT-199), that act on anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins at the outer mitochondrial membrane. To explore this hypothesis, we investigated whether the combined administration of <i>cis<\/i>Pt and ABT-199 leads to a synergistic cell death induction in ovarian cancer cells with different <i>cis<\/i>Pt resistance and mitochondrial content.<br \/>Detection of cell death by flow cytometric measurements of the mitochondrial membrane potential and exposure of phosphatidylserine demonstrated a synergistic cell death induction by <i>ci<\/i><i>s<\/i>Pt and ABT-199 in OVCAR4 and OVCAR8 cells, irrespective of the <i>ci<\/i><i>s<\/i>Pt resistance. Interestingly, Western blot analysis revealed that ABT-199 induced the accumulation of the BH3-only protein NOXA in both cancer cell lines. Accumulation of NOXA was dependent on ABT-199-mediated activation of the stress-responsive transcription factor ATF4. Knock-down experiments showed that apoptosis of <i>ci<\/i><i>s<\/i>Pt-resistant OVCAR8 cells by the combined treatment with ABT-199 and <i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>s<\/i>Pt was entirely dependent on NOXA. Moreover, also <i>ci<\/i><i>s<\/i>Pt-sensitive OVCAR4 cells revealed an initially reduced apoptosis induction by the NOXA knock-down.<br \/>Our data therefore elucidate the molecular mechanism of the synergistic efficacy of <i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>s<\/i>Pt\/ABT-199 combination therapies, which should be promising especially for the treatment of recurrent tumors developing reduced sensitivity to <i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>s<\/i>Pt-based treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ddc8f774-f2ee-4189-8b66-9b4937808488\/@C03B8ZK7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-03 Bcl-2 family proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bcl-2 protein family,Stress response,Venetoclax,Cisplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13787"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin Schaefer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Weller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias B.

These compounds are naturally occurring and present relatively low toxicity to normal cells and tissues, making them an attractive cancer treatment alternative. SCFAs are the chemical by-products of microbial activity known as fermentation. RES is a polyphenolic compound found in select fruits and vegetables and has been known for its versatility in preventing and reversing many diseases, including several cancers. Butyric and propionic acid are considered the most potent of the SCFAs found within the intestinal lumen. The prime goal of this research is to understand if the RES and SCFA compounds use a shared biological pathway(s) to fight and inhibit cancer. We used TRAMP C1 and C3 prostate cancer cells (transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate) as an experimental model. These cells were treated with the RES and SCFAs both singularly and synergistically for 24hrs. The cells were analyzed to understand the potential cell toxicity and proliferation, the modulation of apoptotic and proapoptotic proteins\/genes, and any change in mitochondrial membrane potential pathways. The result demonstrated that the expression of apoptogenic proteins induces programmed cell death in a mitochondria-independent manner. Therefore, the result suggests that RES and SCFAs can facilitate many critical biological functions within the host's body, including cellular respiration, nutrient assimilation, and various immunological responses to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Resveratrol,Fatty acids,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13789"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James Stokes III<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajesh Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manoj K.

The heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a promising therapeutic target because it affects the overall progression of cancer, including cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. A variety of N-terminal HSP90 inhibitors have been tried several times in clinical trials, but none have been approved for clinical use to date due to issues including heat shock response (HSR) induction, undesirable effects, and clinical toxicity. In this study, we sought to investigate whether a novel C-terminal HSP90 inhibitor SL-145 could resolve metastasis in TNBC through inhibition of cancer stem-like properties.<br \/>Experimental Design: The effects of SL-145 on TNBC cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> were evaluated in terms of cell proliferation, apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)-like properties and heat shock response. An orthotopic allograft model with 4T1 mammospheres was used to examine the effect of SL-145 on tumor growth and metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: SL-145 induces apoptosis without triggering the HSR and simultaneously inhibits several oncogenic signaling pathways including AKT, MEK\/ERK and JAK2\/STAT3. SL-145 effectively targets BCSC-like properties with significant reductions in CD44, CD49f and ALDH1 expression as well as impairment of mammosphere-forming ability. To confirm the physiological relevance of our <i>in vitro<\/i> observations, we investigated the effects of SL-145 on tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis in mammosphere-derived allograft tumors with self-renewal capacity. SL-145 administration reduced tumor burden and angiogenesis, which were enriched in BCSCs, and it resulted in significant reductions in lung and liver metastases. In addition, no toxic effects of inhibitors on markers of liver or renal function were observed.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings suggest that SL-145 may represent an effective therapeutic approach for targeting cancer stem cells and simultaneous inhibition of the HSP90 client oncoprotein to treat TNBC with a heterogeneous and aggressive nature.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hsp90,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Metastasis,Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13790"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Minsu Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae-Min Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soeun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung Min Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juyeon Seo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongmi Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seongjae Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>So Ra Seuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Gu Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kee Dal Nam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoon-Jae Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Hong Seo<\/i><\/presenter>.

We sought to examine the role of MALT1 in B-ALL and determine the biological consequences of inhibiting its activity.<br \/>First, we tested MALT1 expression by immunoblot in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) using 16 cell lines representing the disease spectrum and found that MALT1 was expressed in all cell lines at different levels. To determine sensitivity to MALT1 inhibition we used two molecules: Z-VRPR-fmk, a highly selective MALT1 blocking peptide, and MI2, a small molecule MALT1 inhibitor. Z-VRPR-fmk resulted in a dramatic cell growth inhibition in most of our B-ALL cell lines, with appropriate positive (JEKO) and negative (JURKAT) controls. We did not observe a clear correlation between MALT1 level and degree of sensitivity to Z-VRPR-fmk. Interestingly, the two ibrutinib-resistant cell lines RS4;11 and 697, were amongst the top sensitive cell lines to MALT1 inhibition. A similar pattern of cell sensitivity was observed when these cell lines were treated with MI2, with a positive correlation between the IC50 of MI2 and the amount of cell growth inhibition with Z-VRPR-fmk (r=0.74 95%CI (0.47-0.88) p=0.0001). Interestingly, freshly collected PBMCs from patients with B-ALL showed a high sensitivity to MI2 following incubation at serial dilutions for 48h. Furthermore, apoptotic and cell cycle analyses showed a dose-dependent apoptotic induction and cell cycle arrest in the studied cell lines.<br \/>Surprisingly, the proteolytic activity of MALT1, studied by measuring its ability to cleave its targets such as CYLD, BCL10, and RelB, was not detected at baseline, nor after proteasomal inhibition with MG-132 or following crosslinking of pre-BCR with anti-IgM in pre-B ALL, the latter successfully increased AKT phosphorylation. Collectively, these data are suggestive of distinct role for MALT1 in B-ALL.<br \/>To explore this possibility, we used RNA sequencing to determine the changes in gene expression profiling following an 8h MI2 treatment in 12 sensitive B-ALL cell lines. Out of 39,514 tested genes, there were 160 genes whose expression changed &#8805; 2-fold at <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05 (84 down- and 76 up-regulated). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified 34 <i>Hallmark<\/i> and <i>Oncogenic Signature<\/i> gene sets relevant to B-ALL that were <u>all<\/u> downregulated by MI2 (FDR &#60; 10%, and normalized enrichment score (NES) &#8805; 1.50). Among those gene sets the c-MYC, gene signatures stood out as the most affected, further confirmed with downregulation of the MYC protein by immunoblot analysis in MI2-sensitive cell lines.<br \/>In conclusion, MALT1 plays a critical role in B-ALL survival likely through a novel mechanism that involves MYC regulation, independently from pre-BCR\/BCR signaling.<br \/>Supported by a grant from the <i>Ladies Leukemia League, Inc., of the Gulf South Region<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/af7cf6eb-a706-4776-a8fb-110b119d82fe\/@C03B8ZK7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-04 Caspases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Caspases,Myc,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13791"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ishwarya Satyavarapu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Firas M.

Recent studies estimate that over 1.4 million males are diagnosed with prostate cancer on an annual basis, with approximately 375 000 succumbing to the disease annually. With current treatments continuing to show severe side effects, there is a need for new treatments. In this study we looked at the effect of <i>cannabis sativa <\/i>extract, cannabidiol and cisplatin on prostate cancer cells, PC3.<br \/>Methods: In addressing the above questions, we employed the MTT assay to measure the antiproliferative effect on PC3 cells following treatment with varying concentrations of <i>Cannabis sativa<\/i> extract, cisplatin and cannabidiol. xCELLigence was also used to confirm the IC50 activity in which cells were grown in a 16 well plate coated with gold and monitor cell. Caspase 3\/7 activity was also measured using 96 well-plate following treatment. Western-blot and qRT-PCR was also used to measure the gene expression of tumor suppressor genes, p53, Bax and Bcl2. Animal studies were employed to measure the growth of PC3-mouse derived cancer to evaluate the effect of compounds <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: From the treatment with varying concentrations of <i>Cannabis sativa<\/i> extract, cannabidiol and cisplatin, we have observed that the three compounds induced antiproliferation of PC3 cancer cell lines through the activation of caspase 3\/7 activity. We also observed induction of apoptosis in these cells following silencing of retinoblastoma binding protein 6 (RBBP6), with upregulation of p53 and bax mRNA expression, and a reduction in Bcl2 gene expression. The growth of tumors in the mouse models were reduced following treatment with cisplatin and cannabidiol.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrated that cannabidiol is a viable therapy to treat prostate cancer cells, in combination with silencing of RBBP6. This suggests that cannabidiol rather <i>Cannabis sativa<\/i> extract may play an important role in reducing cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor activity,Cell death,p53,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13792"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lesetja Raymond Motadi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nonhlanhla B.
