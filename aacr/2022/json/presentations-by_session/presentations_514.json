[{"Abstract":"<b>Purpose:<\/b> Hypoxia is widely recognized as a determiner in cancer. Cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) is demonstrated to be a novel oxygen sensor, globally expressed in animals and plants. However, the functions of ADO in human cancers remain unclear. This study was to identify the survival association of ADO in cancers and to excavate its underlying mechanisms.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> Transcriptional expression profiles, clinical characteristics, single nucleotide variation (SNV) data, and 450K methylation data were downloaded from all cancer types in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Two independent liver cancer datasets GSE14520 and GSE36376 were downloaded for further validation.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The expression of ADO gene was differentially expressed in various cancers. High expression of ADO indicated a worse OS and PFS in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), acute myeloid leukemia, liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), while predicted better OS and PFS in brain lower-grade glioma (LGG), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Across various cancers, ADO was positively correlated with tumor-associated pathways including G2\/M_checkpoint, MYC_targets, and TGFB while negatively correlated with Genes_upregulated_by_reactive_oxygen_species (ROS) through ssGSEA analysis. The expression of ADO gene was highly correlated with hypoxic marker HIF1A, HIF2A, KDM5A, and KDM6A in almost all cancer types while poorly correlated with Hallmark_hypoxia geneset and Regulation_of_cellular response_to_hypoxia geneset, which indicated that ADO might work independently with HIF1A-mediated response. ADO was positively correlated with the methylation of most chromatin regulators in LGG and LIHC. ADO expression positively correlated with most immune checkpoint molecules in most cancers. Notably, a highly positive correlation between ADO and CD276, ENTPD1, or HMGB1 was observed in most cancer types. In liver cancer, ADO was positively correlated with the infiltration of B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells. However, ADO expression was not strongly relevant to TMB in liver cancer. The increased expression, poor survival indication and immune checkpoint correlation of ADO in liver cancer were further validated by GSE14520 and GSE36376 datasets.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b> ADO was differentially expressed in various cancers and significantly associated with survival in some cancer types including liver cancer. The underlying mechanism might be associated with the G2\/M checkpoint, MYC targets and TGFB pathways, and ADO-mediated HIF1A-independent hypoxic response. The immune cell infiltrates and immune checkpoints association hints that ADO might be a biomarker for immunotherapy in liver cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/797d5d6b-2dbe-4aca-a0c4-654c01ec5eba\/@p03B8ZPR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,ADO,Cancer,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17457"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jie Huang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yao Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiannan Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiawei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xueqin Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shenglin Ma<\/i><\/presenter>.

CRCs carry high degrees of genomic instability (GI), which enables cancer evolution and makes prognosis poorer. Thus, GI is an exploitable target for therapy purposes. GI can be caused by gene mutation, alteration in gene expression, epigenetic modification, and other infectious or environmental factors. Several mutated genes involved in Chromosome instability and\/or microsatellite instability have been identified. Yet it has not been technically feasible to modify functions of mutated genes (e.g., APC, TP53). From the drug development&#8217; standpoint, inhibition of over-expressed target gene is preferred. However, specific genes involved in GI via expression alterations in CRCs have not been comprehensively identified. The gap in knowledge hinders development of CRC therapies targeting GI in CRC. In a previous study, we developed a data mining strategy (Gene Expression to Copy Number Alterations; &#8220;GE-CNA&#8221;) and comprehensively identified 1,578 genes that associate with CNA in lung adenocarcinoma, among which 39 were survival-critical (i.e., expression levels correlate with significant differences in patients&#8217; survival).<br \/><b>Rationale:<\/b> Causal genes for GI via expressions have not been comprehensively identified in CRCs. Thus, the mechanistic understanding of GI generation in CRC remains incomplete. Few attempts have been made to understand the organ-specificity of genomic instability in cancer.<br \/><b>Main Results:<\/b> We applied the GE-CNA approach to 592 TCGA CRC datasets, and identified 513 genes whose expression levels associate with CNA. Among these, 27 were survival-critical. Comparison with previous results from lung adenocarcinoma indicated striking differences between lung adenocarcinoma and CRC: (a) overall CNA numbers are higher in lung adenocarcinoma than CRC in all stages, (b) 262 CRC-CNA facilitator genes did not show significant concentration in a specific pathway, and (c) 251 CRC-CNA suppressor genes are concentrated in the following pathways: Interferon Signaling, Antigen Presentation Pathway, Heme Biosynthesis II, Natural Killer Cell Signaling, Retinoic acid Mediated Apoptosis Signaling, JAK\/Stat Signaling, Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling, Heme Biosynthesis from Uroporphyrinogen-III I, and Glutathione Redox Reactions II.<br \/><b>Implications:<\/b> The 27 survival-critical genomic instability genes are potential targets to suppress CRC genomic instability and therefore are targets for CRC drug development. Causal genes for genomic instability via expressions differ among organs. Hence, the &#8220;targeting genomic instability and\/or aneuploidy&#8221; approach will need to be tailored for the specific target organ.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4ee48a02-1a3f-492e-831f-4428d02dd10e\/@p03B8ZPR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Genomic instability,Lung adenocarcinoma,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17459"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chinthalapally V.

Existing tools, with complicated parameters and changeable filtering standards, may not be suitable specifically for cancer somatic mutations. In addition, previous genomic studies usually adopted different filtering criteria for processing raw sequencing datasets, which greatly restricts the efficiency of integrative exploration for cancer genomics.<br \/>In this study, we presented CaMutQC, a heuristic cancer somatic mutations (CAMs) quality control and filtration package for cancer genomic studies. CaMutQC provides two schemes, including filtration of false positive mutations generated by technical issues, and the screening of candidate cancer somatic mutations from single or multiple VEP-annotated files in VCF format. Specifically, for quality control, instead of directly discarding CAMs that failed to meet the thresholds of parameters collected from classic studies, CaMutQC labels them with customized tags to represent the filtering type, enabling portable subsequent analyses. And a vivid and well-structured filter report is generated after filtration or selection. In addition, we proved by applying an updated mutation QC strategy, which takes the union of CaMutQC-filtered cancer variants from multiple variant callers (eg. MuTect, MuSE and VarScan2) on published datasets that, CaMutQC can not only reduce the false positive CAMS, but also greatly rescue the false negative CAMS from each single caller or the overlap of multiple tools.<br \/>In summary, in this study, for the first time, we systematically implemented the parameters and criteria of CAMs quality control from published studies into the CaMutQC package, which we believe it would be a valuable tool for cancer genomic research. CaMutQC is implemented in R and is available at https:\/\/github.com\/likelet\/CaMutQC under the GPL-v3 license.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2815e06-cdf1-43c0-b0b7-8d53861a017a\/@p03B8ZPR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutation detection,Cancer genomics,Bioinformatics,Somatic mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17460"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Qi Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Diagnosis is based on histopathological features. Developing effective therapies against uLMS is a challenge due its resistance to conventional radiation and chemotherapy. <i>In vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> models for uLMS are urgently needed and it has been proposed that knockout mice for the gene <i>PSMB9<\/i> (MIM:177045), also known by <i>LMP2<\/i>, could be a good model to study uLMS. Previous studies using mice homozygous deficiency for <i>PSMB9<\/i> presented abnormalities in the biological functions of the immunoproteasome and spontaneously developed uLMS thus suggesting this gene as a tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore, expression of PSMB9 was suggested to be a specific biomarker for the diagnosis of uLMS. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of <i>PSMB9<\/i> in uLMS using <i>in silico<\/i> analysis of transcriptomics data from a patient cohort, combined with publicly available datasets. Molecular data were integrated and used for a meta-analysis of RNA-seq in order to find Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs). A total of 68, 66 and 67 samples from normal myometrium (MM), uterine leiomyoma (LM) and uLMS, respectively, were analyzed. A quality control followed by adapter removal and alignment step was assessed using FastQC, Trim-galore and HISAT2 software respectively and counting reads was performed using htseq-count. Expression values were calculated as Transcripts Per Million (TPM) in order to remove libraries dependencies. Differential expression analysis was done using DESeq2 and edgeR and genes were classified as DEG when that had adjusted p-value &#60; 0.01 and |log2FC| &#8805; 2 in both packages. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed using fgsea package with 100,000 permutations and MSigDB collections (KEGG and Reactome) as input parameters. Our results showed an over-expression of <i>PMSB9<\/i> in uLMS samples and immune-related pathways were significantly enriched. Moreover, the overall survival analysis for the outcome of uLMS patients based on <i>PSMB9<\/i> expression in TCGA showed no significant changes, further questioning the importance of PSMB9 in uLMS malignancy. Finally, based on phylogenetic analysis we showed that <i>PSMB9<\/i> conservation between <i>Mus musculus<\/i> and <i>Homo sapiens<\/i> is not closely related. This divergence suggests that the biological role of PSMB9 may differ between M. musculus and H. sapiens. Human uLMS exhibits an over-expression in PSMB9 and these findings suggest <i>PSMB9<\/i>-deficient mice are not an appropriate diagnostic-biomarker for uLMS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/50cdb7ed-0d71-467d-84b7-b55a9c6916c8\/@p03B8ZPR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Biomarkers,Differential gene expression,Expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17461"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Raul Maia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georgia Kokaraki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge E.

Development of stroma targeting therapeutics for PDAC is gaining attention because PDAC has a unique tumor microenvironment with dense tumor stroma and the tumor stroma is a critical mediator of PDAC progression. Herein, we discovered pancreatic cancer stroma-specific cell surface markers by integrative analysis of single cell RNA sequencing and cell surface marker database.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Single cell RNA sequencing data of PDAC tissue (n = 3, GSE154778) and normal pancreas tissue (n = 3, GSE131886) was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Using Seurat package, the data from each sample integrated and the cells were clustered. We selected stroma cell cluster for differential analysis to obtain the genes enriched in PDAC stroma. Then, the intersection of the PDAC stroma specific genes with the gene set of SurfaceomeDB was obtained, which allowed us to obtain the stroma cell surface markers that are highly expressed in PDAC. The marker genes were validated in 1) 36 pairs of PDAC and normal tissue samples from a RNA sequencing data (GSE15471), and 2) 143 PDAC samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 328 normal pancreatic tissues in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database (https:\/\/www.gtexportal.org).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The cells from PDAC and normal pancreas were clustered into ductal\/tumor, stromal and immune cell clusters according to the expression of cell-type specific marker genes. We identified variably expressed genes between PDAC and normal cells within the stromal cell cluster. Among the PDAC stroma-specific genes, we could obtain 360 cell surface markers using SurfaceomeDB. The top ten PDAC stroma-specific cell surface marker genes were MXRA8, ANTXR1, THY1, SCD1, LY6E, BST2, GPNMB, CDH11, GJB2, and CD55. To validate the results, we compared the expression levels of the top 10 genes between pancreatic cancer tissue and adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. We found that the expression levels of the genes were significantly higher in the cancer tissue compared to the normal pancreatic tissue. We also confirmed that the expression levels of 10 genes were significantly higher in all stages of PDAC compared to normal tissues in a combined RNA sequencing dataset from healthy human pancreatic tissue from GTEx and pancreatic cancer patients from TCGA.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We identified pancreatic cancer stroma-specific cell surface markers using single-cell RNA sequencing data and SurfaceomeDB.

Our study aimed to find the role of differentially expressed microRNAs that play a role in prostate cancer etiopathology. With the use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), we narrowed down a desired dataset (GSE138740). While analyzing the dataset, we found the expression pattern of hsa-miR-3157-3p (adjusted p-value 0.04797) to be significantly upregulated in low grade tumor samples (Gleason Score 6 and n=88) compared to high grade tumor samples (Gleason Score 8,9 and n=13). Furthermore, the role of hsa-miR-3157-3p in prostate cancer remains a novel finding. We have identified target genes such as E2F3, UBE2M, ABCF1, PKN3 and VANGL1 using the RNA Central website portal. Further studies are underway to elucidate the expression pattern of this miRNA and it&#8217;s target genes that would correlate with the disease progression observed among tumor samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software generated report will be presented at the meeting to describe gene networks and pathways implicated in Prostate Cancer. Overall, these studies are designed to further validate whether this miRNA and its target genes can serve as potential biomarkers to predict the onset and progression from low to high grade prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6961ede8-4d2a-4f64-93a2-e7b747597a11\/@q03B8ZPS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Bioinformatics,Cancer genomics,Microarray,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17465"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akhil Wali<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hari Koul<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, most HNSC patients do not respond to ICIs. Radioimmunotherapy has been proposed to enhance the immune response rate in HNSC. Herein, we aimed to explore the effect of DKK1 on radiotherapy and immunotherapy in HNSC. We collected the gene expression profile and clinical information of HNSC patients from TCGA, GEO, and ICGC. The immune cell infiltration, level of related pathways and biological processes, signature scores of gene sets of interest were assessed using CIBERSORT, GSEA or GSVA respectively. One of the genes, Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a secreted protein which plays important roles in the Wnt signaling pathways, was identified because of its significantly higher expression in HNSC. Then, we confirmed the DKK1 expression at protein level by immunohistochemistry of HNSC tissue microarray. CCK8, apoptosis detection and survival curves were performed to investigate the response of DKK1-knockdown HSC-3 cell line to radiation. We found the mRNA and protein expression level of DKK1 was significantly higher in HNSC tissue. The DKK1<sup>high<\/sup> group had a shorter survival time in both disease-free survival and overall survival than the DKK1<sup>low<\/sup> group. The DKK1<sup>high<\/sup> group showed a more immunosuppressive microenvironment with lower infiltration of T cells and higher infiltration of MDSCs. Furthermore, the DKK1<sup>high<\/sup> group was enriched in radioresistance related to wound healing, angiogenesis, and autophagy. Patients in the DKK1<sup>high<\/sup> group who received radiotherapy had much poorer disease-free survival and overall survival than those in the DKK1<sup>low<\/sup> group. HSC-3 cell line was more sensitive to radiation after knockdown of DKK1 by siRNA. Finally, we established a risk score system based on the 9 genes from 41 DKK1-associated immunomodulators and created a nomogram model to predict the prognosis of the patients. Our data show that DKK1 can affect both radiotherapy and immunotherapy in HNSC, suggesting that DKK1 can be a potential target for radioimmunology in HNSC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioimmunotherapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17466"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xinyu YE<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>JIAN Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingxuan Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyu Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yueming Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yinghao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiuzhi Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingwen Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rencui Quan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify survival-associated AS events and developed the prognostic model based on 11-AS events. The immune cells and different response to cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockers in low-risk and high-risk group of OV patients were analyzed. Ten kinds of immune cells were found up-regulated in low-risk group. Activated B cell, natural killer T cell, natural killer cell and regulatory T cell were associated with survival of OV. The patients in low-risk group had good response to CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockers treatment. Moreover, a regulatory network was established according to the correlation between AS events and splicing factors (SFs). The present study provided valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of OV.

This represents a very valuable resource to researchers in the field, offering a reference for comparison of novel results, as well as opportunities for original meta-analysis studies. However, the massive amount of biological information renders its exploitation difficult in the absence of a well-structured and annotated resource. Marked heterogeneity and variability between studies in terms of cancer type, clinical context, technological platform, data quality, number and type of cells, create additional bottlenecks. We have developed a fully integrated scRNAseq database exclusively dedicated to human cancer. It gathers 134 datasets on 51 different cancer types, annotated in 50 fields containing precise clinical, technological and biological information. We developed an original data processing pipeline organized in 4 steps: first, data collection; second, data processing, which includes quality control, sample integration, cell clustering; third, cell ontology tree of the TME, built and used to annotate the clusters in a supervised and manual manner; and fourth, interface to analyze TME in a cancer type-specific or global manner. This integrated, accessible and user-friendly resource should be of great value to the biomedical community. It represents an unprecedented level of detailed annotation, offering vast possibilities for downstream exploitation of human cancer scRNAseq data for discovery and validation studies.

Universal MSI testing would benefit to patients to receive a better therapy, but many patients remain untested. To deliver broadly accessible MSI testing, deep learning models have demonstrated their feasibility for MSI prediction using H&#38;E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs). However, to be deployed into clinical routine care, prediction models should be validated in datasets from multicenter and multiethnic groups. In addition, these models should provide uncertainty of prediction to help clinicians to make informed decisions.<br \/>Method: We develop a MSI prediction model using WSIs based on Deep Gaussian process (DGP), a Bayesian model being able to model the uncertainty in prediction. We implement a DGP model in the transfer learning, where a WPI is decomposed into multiple non-overlap image patches which are converted to feature vectors by a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, the DGP model makes a prediction for an image by averaging score function values at all the feature vectors in the image in weakly supervised learning (WSL). To test our method, we collected H&#38;E stained colorectal\/stomach cancer slides (n=1,619) from multi-institutions and multiethnic groups, including TCGA Colorectal (CRC; n=351) and Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD; n=174) and six datasets from tertiary hospitals in Korea (i.e., Yonsei-1 (n=174), Yonsei-1-remade (n=146), Yonsei-2 (n=95), St. Mary-1 (n=48), St. Mary-2 (n=50), and Yonsei-CLASSIC trial (n=581)). We also compare our method to multiple deep learning methods, including Densenet, Resnet, Shufflenet, Googlenet, Squeezenet and two WSL models, MIL (Campanell et al., 2019) and CLAM (Lu et al., 2021).<br \/>Result: In each cancer type, we train each model using TCGA dataset as discovery cohort and tested on the rest of datasets as validation cohort. We use the area under of roc curve (AUC) for the evaluation metric. For the CRC cohorts, our DGP method achieves overall best performance with 0.81 (Yonsei-1), 0.82 (Yonsei-1-remade), 0.89 (Yonsei-2), 0.85 (St. Mary-1) 0.75 (St. Mary-2) AUCs compared to the state-of-the art methods. For the STAD cohorts, our method also achieves overall best performance with 0.74 AUC (Yonsei-classic). In addition, incorporating the uncertainty in prediction measured by our method improves the model&#8217;s performance to predict MSI. Specifically, removing cases with prediction results with high uncertainty, which could lead false positive prediction, significantly improves MSI prediction performance. Taken together, these results demonstrate the robustness and generalisability of the DGP model for MSI prediction across multicenter and multiethnic datasets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ba0e839d-faab-47e9-9f86-a3509cec0040\/@q03B8ZPS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Microsatellite instability,Deep learning,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17469"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sunho Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongming Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung Hak Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeonghyun Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Hyun Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, to date, there has been no multi-omic investigations analyzing these biological traits simultaneously. Thus, there is a paucity in our understanding of the intricate relationship between intragastric microbes and the host in gastric disease. To address this gap, we aimed to comprehensively investigate the microbiome, host gene expression, and immune cells in the stomach across a range of different states along the gastric carcinogenesis pathway.<br \/>Methods: Gastric biopsy samples were obtained from healthy individuals or patients with gastritis or gastric cancer (biopsy cohort, n=30). Surgical samples (of cancer and adjacent severe gastritis tissues) were obtained from gastric cancer patients (surgery cohort, n=40). Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, RNA-seq, and cell-type enrichment analysis of each participant&#8217;s biospecimens, we identified associations between the microbiome and host transcriptome or inferred immune cell types.<br \/>Results: Microbiome composition and gene expression patterns showed significant differences between disease states (healthy, gastritis, or cancer). Expression of &#8216;Cell cycle&#8217; pathway genes was enriched in gastric cancer in both biopsy and surgery cohorts. In the biopsy cohort, Helicobacteraceae, which was abundant in gastritis, was highly correlated with FAM3D, which was previously found to be involved in gastrointestinal inflammation. In the surgery cohort, Lachnospiraceae, which was abundant in gastric cancer, was highly correlated with UBD, which is known to regulate mitosis and reduce cell cycle time. Cell-type enrichment analysis revealed lower B cell infiltration in gastric cancer than in gastritis (both cohorts). Tissue-infiltrating B cells were associated with Helicobacteraceae.<br \/>Conclusions: Associations between the intragastric microbiome, human gene expression, and tissue-infiltrating immune cells are unique to gastric disease state. The findings herein may aid the discovery of novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets of gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/14b0661c-e18f-444a-a30d-8fd53359cbcb\/@q03B8ZPS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-07 Sequence analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Gene expression,Immune cells,Gastric cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17471"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chan Hyuk Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Changjin Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>A-reum Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaeyun Sung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Hyun Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>.

A PPS was conducted for the GuardantOMNI assay to characterize the expected variability in blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) score across a representative range of expected bTMB scores in clinical samples. The simulations were aligned to, but not completely prescribed by, the PPS guidance provided in Guidance for Industry and and Food and Drug Administration Staff Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Ovarian Adnexal Mass Assessment Score Test System. A sample&#8217;s bTMB score is a real valued quantity (e.g., bTMB = 21.04 mut\/Mb) that is derived by multiplying the number of qualified mutations observed within a targeted panel by a scaling factor. Variability in observed bTMB scores for a given blood sample is governed primarily by sample coverage, tumor shedding level, and the assay somatic variant detection probabilities (a function of underlying variant allele frequencies, VAFs).<br \/>Methods: The relationship between site-specific total molecule counts and coverage was modeled utilizing a composite dataset consisting of both clinical and contrived samples. Sample coverage was modeled using variance component estimates from Precision Study data (18 cancer samples each with 6 to 18 replicates).<br \/>The reference, single-strand mutant, and double-strand mutant molecule counts for a somatic variant site detected in at least one sample replicate were modeled utilizing a bias corrected Dirichlet Multinomial model.<br \/>The variants with the simulated VAF and coverage levels were processed with the GuardantOMNI germline\/somatic classifier to account for the uncertainty in germline\/somatic classification at lower coverage values.<br \/>Results: Precision profiles consisting of simulation derived %CV estimates for 18 clinical samples with a representative set of mean bTMB scores were generated. The PPS bTMB score distributions were consistent with the bTMB scores observed in the Precision Study, supported by visualization and confidence intervals at level 0.05 margins of equivalence for the empirical mean bTMB and standard deviation estimates.<br \/>The sample specific %CV estimates were observed, in most instances, to decrease with increasing input levels for matched targeted LoD (Limit of Detection) simulation results.<br \/>Precision profile %CV estimates were observed to be inversely related to mean bTMB scores.<br \/>Conclusions: The results provide proof of principle that estimation of GuardantOMNI bTMB score precision via an intuitive and interpretable simulation model is viable.

The definition of the interplay(s) between immune\/stromal cells and premalignant\/malignant GAC cells could propel us into a new dimension of understanding and therapeutics. Here, we performed a comprehensive single-cell profiling of 68 specimens collected from 43 subjects including non-neoplastic tumor adjacent tissue, precancerous lesions, localized, and metastatic GACs. We profiled a total of 77,392 high-quality cells which revealed 62 unique cell states uncovering varying profiles. We define alterations in TMEs that underscore initiation of tumorigenesis to eventual progression. For instance, we found a striking preponderance of B lineage cells, primarily the IgA+ plasma cells, in TMEs of the precancerous lesions, whereas 3 immunosuppressive myeloid subsets with high expression of genes signature including <i>SPP1, LAIR1, SIRPA, TIM-3, TGFB1, <\/i>and<i> MARCO <\/i>dominated in advanced GACs. We observed that fractions of GZMK+ effector CD8 T cells and progenitor exhausted CD8 T cells gradually increased as GACs progressed to advanced stages with highest abundant in metastatic GACs. In addition, our analysis revealed extensive stromal remodeling along the GAC continuum, which may have contributed to enhanced angiogenesis and progressive immune suppressive signaling. Notably, we uncovered 3 unique TME interactomes that are defined by 6 cellular environtypes that provide context-dependent definition and granularity to GAC networks inhabited by 62 TME cell subsets giving GAC to a novel landscape not yet defined. The two distinct environtypes in GAC primaries are validated in three independent large-scale GAC cohorts, giving credence and definition to previously established histopathological variables, genomic\/molecular subtypes and clinical outcomes. The analysis of tumor associated stromal cells discovered SDC2 as an exploitable target to pursue. SDC2 was not only abundant in the stroma, but the abundance is validated in 3 independent single-cell GAC cohorts as well as at the protein level using independent approaches. Overexpression of SDC2 formed a gradient from early GAC to metastatic and is prognostic in large-scale GAC cohorts examined. This study provides an atlas of GAC TMEs from tumorigenesis to advanced GAC that could be further developed for novel therapeutics but also serves as a community resource.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ce284cca-f333-4170-88f9-94acd4c1f1de\/@r03B8ZPT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Single cell,Stomach cancer,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18404"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ruiping Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shumei Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiangjiang Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yibo Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deyali Chatterjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ghia Tatlonghari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyuan Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Can Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaowei Mo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matheus D.

A number of biomarkers have been reported to be associated with the likelihood of patient responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), including the expression of PD-L1, tumor mutational burden (TMB), tumor infiltration lymphocytes, and T cell repertoire. However, these biomarkers showed variable performance even conflicting conclusions in different cohorts. And a large proportion of patients exhibited an immune-exclusion or immune-desert phenotype that cannot be explained by current biomarkers. In addition, establishing a cohort with adequate sample size requires multiple years of multi-center efforts. Therefore, it is still a challenge and a lack for the evaluation of efficacy of known biomarkers and the discovery of new signature(s) in a large-scale study. We hypothesized that a data-driven meta-analysis approach integrating multi-cohorts with multi-omics data will help to characterize the predictive genomic features and discover the mechanisms of antitumor immune responses.<br \/>In this work, we collected 3,037 ICI therapy samples with genetic and transcriptomics data for 14 cancer types. Then a data-driven strategy was designed to explore each type of genomic feature which included gene mutations, pathway mutations, TMB, mutational signatures, gene expression, pathway expression, interaction among checkpoint blockade, and immune cell components. Then a comprehensive analysis, which contained a meta-analysis for the identification of consistent biomarkers across multiple cohorts and a data aggregation-analysis for the identification of rare biomarkers on aggregated data, was performed to explore the associations between ICI response and omics features. Furthermore, we validated these signatures as biomarkers in three independent cohorts. Finally, we identified five types of biomarkers, including 1) two biomarkers regarding source of antigen (TMB and mutations of MYO7B), 2) one feature of responding to antigen (cytotoxic T lymphocytes pathway), 3) three biomarkers indicating macrophages M1 infiltrations (macrophages M1 component, and two marker genes of macrophages M1, CXCL11 and CCL19), 4) one biomarker regarding immune interactions (expression relations among immune checkpoint genes), and 5) two biomarkers about T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment (IFNG and ligands genes of chemokine receptor CXCR3). In addition, a predictive module was built based on these signatures and outperformed than TMB or PD-L1 expression which were approved molecular biomarkers by FDA. We found high TMB patients had more likelihood to active the cytotoxic T lymphocytes which secret IFNG to kill tumor cell and promote the recruitment of macrophage M1.

Cas9-mediated DNA break formation induces toxic effects that are proportional with the number of cuts. Consequently, the DepMap data displays a &#8216;copy number alteration effect&#8217; (CNA effect), in which sgRNAs targeting highly amplified regions of the genome produce depletion effects. Indeed, when sgRNAs target intergenic regions of amplified regions, the observed effects are comparable to the targeting of essential genes. Hence, correcting the CNA effect is crucial to reduce false positive (and increase true negative) co-dependencies between genes. Currently, the CERES methodology is used to correct for CNA effects. By applying a consensus-independent component analysis-based (consensus ICA) algorithm on gene essentiality data after CERES correction, we observed that many CNA effects are still present in the CERES-corrected data. Subsequently, we developed a methodology that outperforms CERES in removing the CNA effect. For example, we identified a set of genes mapping to chromosome 8q of sample ACH-000542 (ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line HEYA8 having amplification at chromosome 8q) having significantly lower essentiality levels compared to the rest of the genome. Whereas the CERES algorithm did not correct this effect of the chromosome 8q amplification, it was captured by consensus ICA in a consensus estimated source and was corrected by our novel methodology. After removing all CNA effects from gene essentiality data, we observed that 12.07% of co-dependency scores reported by CERES-corrected data decreased by 0.2 (on a range of -1 to 1), and 11.34% co-dependency scores increased by 0.2. In conclusion, consensus ICA-based methodology improves the correction of the CNA effect on gene essentiality data. Application of our improved method of CNA effect correction could reduce the number of false positive targets in validating biological hypotheses leading to novel therapeutic strategies in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/187473f2-d2dd-4749-a887-f0e574f921df\/@r03B8ZPT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Copy number alterations,Independent component analysis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18406"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arkajyoti Bhattacharya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos G.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the commonest thyroid malignancy making about 80% of all thyroid cancers cases. Gene expression of a number of thyroid-specific TFs has been found deregulated in thyroid carcinomas. Therefore, molecular approaches targeting overexpressed oncogenes are desirable therapeutic methods to improve the treatment of cancer patients. In this study, we used Transcription Factor Enrichment Analysis (TFEA) to detect positional motif enrichment associated with changes in transcription observed in this cancer type.<br \/>Methods: We previously identified differentially expressed genes between PTC and normal thyroid tissue using DNA microarrays. In the current study, the former overexpressed genes were subjected to TFEA using the web-based tool ChEA3. For comparison purposes, the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA2) tool was used to identify the most differentially overexpressed genes in thyroid carcinoma versus paired normal samples from patients in the TCGA database, and the differentially overexpressed gene set was also subjected to TFEA.<br \/>Results: TFEA using the ChEA3 web-server identified several TFs associated with overexpressed genes observed in PTC. The top-ranked TFs found in both the gene set identified in PTC patient samples using microarrays and the gene set identified in the TCGA database using GEPIA2 were: EHF, POU2F3, KLF5, ELF3, HES2, GRHL3, and HNF1B. Several of these TFs have previously been identified in thyroid carcinomas, while others are newly identified. EHF and ELF3 are known to be overexpressed in thyroid carcinogenesis; KLF5 is a zinc-finger transcriptional factor recently found to be highly expressed in a subset of PTC patients with aggressive behavior. Bioinformatics analysis has previously shown that HNF1B is up-regulated in several cancers including thyroid carcinomas. The role of the remaining identified TFs in thyroid carcinogenesis has not been described. POU2F3 is a member of the POU domain family of transcription factors that bind to a specific octamer DNA motif and regulate cell type-specific differentiation pathways. Hes2 encodes a mammalian basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor. GRHL3 (Grainyhead-like 3) is a transcription factor involved in epithelial morphogenesis.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed genes in tumor versus normal paired thyroid tissue samples from PTC patients and in thyroid carcinoma versus paired normal samples from patients in the TCGA database allowed the identification of TFs that may play a role in PTC. The group of TFs identified in this study may represent potential therapeutic targets for this cancer type.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e86984c-7fe9-4177-8e8e-f6c9278dc20e\/@r03B8ZPT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Transcription factor,Expression analysis,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18407"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"e530f19e-a930-47e4-a131-e325315d8359","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e530f19e-a930-47e4-a131-e325315d8359\/@r03B8ZPT\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Niradiz Reyes<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Figueroa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Figueroa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Geliebter<\/i><\/presenter>.

While malignant cells dictate much of the tumor biology, there is evidence that the tumor microenvironment (TME) also plays a major role in disease etiology. Given the complexity and abundance of the TME cellular composition, investigating the role of immune cell types will yield novel biomarkers for tumor progression and response to therapies.<br \/>The role of B cells as a prognostic biomarker remains elusive. For instance, infiltrating B cells in CRC have both positive and negative prognostic value. Thus, a scalable approach to quantify B cells and the B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire could yield novel insights into the role of B cells in tumor biology. To address this, we have developed immune cell quantification (InfiltrateID<sup>TM<\/sup>) and immune receptor repertoire profiling (RepertoireID<sup>TM<\/sup>) methods as part of the ImmunoID NeXT Platform&#174;, an augmented, immuno-oncology-optimized exome\/transcriptome platform.<br \/>We estimate B cell abundance and BCR repertoire by profiling FFPE and PBMC samples using ImmunoID NeXT<sup>TM<\/sup>. In expanding upon InfiltrateID to further estimate B cell abundance, here we regress the bulk RNA-seq readout from a reference signature from purified immune cell types. We also generate orthogonal quantifications of B cell abundance by profiling samples with cytometry by time of flight, single-cell RNA-seq, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We compare BCR results from ImmunoID NeXT to a standalone sequencing approach to evaluate the concordance of top clones. We then utilize BCR profiling from ImmunoID NeXT to analyze clonality and isotype composition in tumor samples.<br \/>We first use InfiltrateID to estimate absolute B cell fractions in over 50 samples. Overall, we observe a high correlation between InfiltrateID results and orthogonal data sets in both PBMC and tumor FFPE samples (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.90). When comparing BCR results from RepertoireID to a standalone BCR sequencing method that profiles IgM and IgG, we identify 475 and 387 of the top 500 clones in IgG and IgM, respectively, with highly concordant abundances across all clones (R<sup>2<\/sup>&#62;0.72 and R<sup>2<\/sup>&#62;0.82 in IgM and IgG, respectively). Next, we use InfiltrateID to estimate absolute B cell fractions in over 650 samples from 14 tumor types. On average, samples display B cell fractions in agreement with the literature and IHC quantifications, with higher B cell fractions in lung, breast, and cervical tumors. We also observe a range of BCR clonality values across tumor types. Finally, we observe differences in B cell composition and repertoire diversity in tumor samples from patients who underwent checkpoint blockade therapy.<br \/>We show that InfiltrateID and RepertoireID accurately capture the composition and clone diversity of infiltrating B cells in tumor samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/552b7920-ea32-4108-b482-3dbbda237e40\/@r03B8ZPT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,Tumor microenvironment,Bioinformatics,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18408"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fabio Navarro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Levy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pamela Milani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shruti Bhide<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Upasana Dutta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles W.

Whether aging as its own entity can be initiator of putative cancerous developments, the transcriptional changes underlying the cancerous development itself are largely unknown. Here, we analyzed publicly available bulk RNA sequencing data of 328 control vs. 453 cancer samples in combination with single cell sequencing datasets from 49 control vs. 105 cancer patients. Using widely accepted aging-associated gene sets, we assembled key features of aging and their reflection in cancer development in five distinct cancer entities with an age-dependent increase of incidence, i.e. chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), colorectal cancer (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung cancer (LC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). After confirmation of the aging\/senescence-induced gene (ASIG) expression to be upregulated in malignant diseases compared to healthy controls, we elucidated the importance of ASIGs during single cell development, making use of pseudotime analyses. In each entity, distinct temporally late enrichment states were carved out, and their transcriptional connectivity next to epigenetic control verified. Remarkably, we were able to demonstrate that all cancer entities analyzed in this study comprised cell populations expressing ASIGs. Except for pancreatic cancer, all entities accounted for subpopulations with aging associated patterns. Using a novel pipeline to repurpose FDA-approved drugs and combinations on a single cell level, we discovered a path for novel treatment regimen on a tumor-specific basis. These respective cellular subpopulations demonstrate pillars of susceptibility within the complex tumor microenvironment and serve as a basis for future studies on the role of aging and senescence in human malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ea19cfd-aef0-45b0-bfb1-907ebdad67be\/@r03B8ZPT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Single cell,Senescence,Transcription,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18411"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dominik Saul<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robyn Laura Kosinsky<\/i><\/presenter>.

Surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy result in an unsatisfying 5-year survival rate of &#60;25%. Although immune adjuvant strategies are promising, recent developments targeting the specialized tumor microenvironment by aiming at osteoclasts and checkpoint inhibitors focus on the individual immune biology. We aimed to mirror the tumor microenvironment and pseudotemporal development of osteoblasts during their transformation to osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. For this purpose, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles of 166,012 osteoblastic osteosarcoma and 49,555 healthy bone cells isolated from 28 patients were analyzed. In pseudotemporal analyses, we identified developmental divergence points with distinct transcriptional patterns purporting paths of devolution or giving rise to proliferative arrest. We found the biologically predicted clinging conjunction between osteoclasts, osteoblasts and B cells as regulatory T cells. In addition, we discovered intratumoral cellular communication patterns with ligand-receptor interactions and secreted signaling analysis between certain pillars of heterogeneous subpopulations, illustrating the importance of the local immune-genomic landscape. Upon several experimentally verified pathways, the TGF-&#946; interaction was paramount. A mathematical assembly of degenerated cell populations revealed canonical markers of an osteoblastic cancerous state, out of which the vast majority has been associated with tumorigenesis in earlier studies. Intriguingly, nonnegative matrix factorization gave rise to a spatially localized senescent cell state, potentially accessible to new senolytic compounds which are currently in clinical trials for aging-related diseases. This senescent state with proliferative arrest and the secretion of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), has not been described in osteosarcoma so far. In addition, we identified novel pathways of intertumoral communication in these distinct clusters, which can be exploited therapeutically, and validated these with a single-cell guided pipeline to repurpose drugs and their combinations. Thus, we were able to define a temporal pattern for the development of osteoblastic osteosarcoma. A local microenvironment with gradual states of devolution, and distinct cell-cell communicational patterns was established, out of which TGF-&#946; warrants further experimental as therapeutical exploitation. Finally, we curtailed degenerated and, surprisingly, senescent subpopulations, each of which were predicted to vary in therapeutic response, mirroring the clinical observed intratumoral heterogeneity and potentially guiding the way to an individualized treatment regimen.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/095dc55d-3bfc-4116-8f69-3c4ff41f19ec\/@r03B8ZPT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Senescence,Single cell,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18412"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dominik Saul<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robyn Laura Kosinsky<\/i><\/presenter>.

The S1400I Phase III randomized LungMap sub-study of nivo+ipi versus nivo accrued 275 (252 eligible) previously-treated patients with stage IV SqCLC and absence of matched mutations (NCT02154490).Here, to investigate the longitudinal (baseline, C2 week 3, C4 week 7, C5 week 9) serum protein changes associated with treatment or response, we performed Olink proximity extension assay in 160 patients (561 samples) using an immuno-oncology panel of 92 analytes. We utilized mixed linear and joint models to identify differentially expressed proteins between treatment arms (nivo vs. nivo+ipi), response and quantify the effect of other potential prognostic factors. This approach quantifies the effect of covariates such as smoking status, demographics, prior radiation therapy, and metastases. We jointly modeled expression and survival to identify changes in proteins over time. The thresholds for significance in differentially expression tests were a log fold change of at least 0.5 and a false discovery rate of under 0.05 (FDR as a multiple testing adjustment method). The joint models used thresholds of log fold change of more than 1 and hazard ratio of more than 1. Results revealed increases in 40 serum proteins after treatment with either nivo alone or combined with ipi, including CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL13, IL6, IL8, IL10, IFNg, and soluble PD-L1 and PDCD1. nivo+ipi treatment showed greater increases in IL8 and CXCL13 post-treatment compared to nivo alone. In addition, circulating IL6, CXCL13, and MIC-A\/B were higher in patients with stable or progressive disease compared to those with objective response after treatment. The joint model revealed a worse hazard ratio with increases in 10 soluble proteins, including IL6, IL8, and CXCL13. Finally, for patients with similar values of IL8, those treated by combination had a better survival outcome than those treated by nivo alone. Using a data-modeling approach, we identified significant longitudinal changes in 40 serum proteins out of 92 tested in patients with SqCLC treated with nivo or nivo+ipi. Increases in serum inflammatory markers IL6 and CXCL13 were associated with worse disease. Although overall survival was not statistically different between arms, our modeling approaches suggested that IL-8 monitoring may help identify patients benefiting more from the combination vs. nivo alone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c3742644-bab7-4f9e-9571-7647d9707796\/@r03B8ZPT\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Proteomics,Machine learning,Squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18413"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Edgar Gonzalez-Kozlova<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsin-Hui Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Redman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roy Herbst<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Gettinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luda Bazhenova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manishkumar Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Nie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jocelyn Harris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Argueta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen Kelly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ethan Cerami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Lindsay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joyce Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roshni Biswas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Van Nostrand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Radim Moravec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diane Marie Del Valle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seunghee Kim-schulze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sacha Gnjatic<\/i><\/presenter>.

It contains 469,183 experimentally-validated PTM sites and their supporting evidence from UniProt Knowledge Base, PhosphoSitePlus, and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). PTMcosmos summarizes the entire spectrum of CPTAC proteomics data on human cancer patients, including protein and PTM peptide abundance data from 10 different cancer types. Additionally, PTMcosmos contains cancer somatic mutations from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), thus allowing for the collective integration and analysis of different data types. In PTMcosmos, we have built an ensemble of interactive visualization tools that allow researchers to investigate altered PTM functions due to genetic alterations in close proximity. The database is live at https:\/\/ptmcosmos.wustl.edu. We used PTMcosmos to investigate PTM regulation across cancer types. First, we examined the differential abundance of the PTM sites of cancer driver genes, focusing primarily on phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (encoded by RB1) and acetylation of the histone acetyltransferase E1A Binding Protein P300 (EP300) across cancer types. We analyzed the association between these PTM events and downstream targets, as well as with tumor subtypes, significantly mutated gene (SMG) mutation status, and clinical features. Second, we investigated the association of the protein abundance of cancer driver genes with ubiquitylsites in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) to nominate potentially novel modes of regulation of these proteins&#8217; activities. We further analyzed the tumor subtype specificity and tumor-normal abundance changes of these ubiquitylsites and their corresponding substrate proteins, identifying several EGFR ubiquitylsites which may regulate EGFR abundance in LSCC. Finally, we identified the linear and spatial clustering of mutations and PTM sites, identifying multiple mutation-PTM clusters in cancer related genes, including <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>PIK3CA<\/i>, <i>CTNNB1<\/i>, <i>EGFR<\/i>, and <i>IDH1<\/i>. We envision that PTMcosmos will serve both the CPTAC consortium and the wider research community to better understand the role of PTMs in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2ee39772-8897-460d-ba0b-3b8719a6fdb0\/@r03B8ZPT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Post-translational modifications,Proteomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18414"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liang-Bo Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akshay Govindan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Song Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Ding<\/i><\/presenter>.

Nuanced care is needed, as the development and clinical course of cancer is multifactorial with influences from the general health status of the patient, germline and neoplastic mutations, co-morbidities, and environment including \"lifestyle\". To tailor an individualized treatment to the patient, such multifactorial data must be presented in an easy-to-use, easy-to-analyze fashion for providers to use effectively.<br \/>Purpose: To address the need, we have built a searchable database integrating cancer-critical gene mutation status, serum galectin protein markers, serum and tumor glycomic profiles, with clinical, demographic, and lifestyle data points of individual patients.<br \/>Methods: The initial data was acquired from breast, colon, and lung cancer patients&#8217; serum and biopsy samples from the Prisma Health Cancer Institute Biorepository. The acquired data contains the status of 2,800 COSMIC cancer-critical gene mutations, individual patient profiles of five serum galectins, and serum and biopsy glycan structures from each patient&#8217;s glycomic profile. DNA from tumor cells was used to screen the regions frequently mutated in human cancer genes. Multiplex PCR using Ion AmpliSeq<sup>TM<\/sup> Cancer Hotspot panel v2 was performed by Precision Genetics. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to perform galectin profiling of cancer patient serum samples. Glycomic profiling of serum and biopsy samples was performed by the Emory Comprehensive Glycomic Core. In addition, healthy control values for galectin and glycomic profiles were obtained and added to the patient database for reference. The data is being stored using Microsoft SQL servers and is fed into an interactive web application using RStudio.<br \/>Results: Our interactive database allows care providers to amalgamate cohorts from these groups to find correlations between different data types with the possibility of finding a \"stage signature\" based upon a combination of genetic mutations, galectin serum levels, glycan signatures, and patient clinical data and lifestyle choices.<br \/>Conclusion: Our project provides a framework for an integrated interactive database to analyze molecular and clinical patterns across cancer stages and provides opportunities for increased diagnostic and prognostic power.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/19455798-89cd-4986-8a5f-8201dff10a84\/@r03B8ZPT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Molecular profiling,Personalized medicine,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18415"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"45c235fc-9c26-4771-b615-c00ba506f214","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/45c235fc-9c26-4771-b615-c00ba506f214\/@r03B8ZPT\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Basil H.

NEK10 is the most divergent member of the NEK family. It is unique in having a catalytic domain that is centrally positioned and flanked by two coiled-coil domains, while all the other NEKs have their catalytic domain near the N-terminus. Instead, NEK10 has four armadillo repeats of unexplored function in its N-terminus. NEK10 seems to play a key role in carcinogenesis and has been linked in melanoma, breast cancer, and a variety of ciliopathies. As part of our long-term goal to build interactomes of all the NEK members, we have previously reported data for known and predicted NEK10 interacting proteins, including novel protein-protein interactions such as HspB1 and MAP3K1, which have not been previously reported in the literature. In this study, we focused on understanding the molecular mechanism underlying NEK10&#8217;s interaction with HspB1 and its functional consequences. HspB1 is involved in various cellular functions such as maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and cell death.&#8239;It is also a well-studied cancer protein and contains a highly conserved &#945;-crystallin domain flanked by disordered N- and C-terminal domains. Many proteins are targeted by HspB1 to promote resistance to cell death, and malignant phenotypes; high levels of HspB1 have been identified in many cancer stem cells, such as those from lung and breast cancers. We used state-of-the-art computational approaches to model and characterize the full-length NEK10 as well as HspB1 protein. Our results offer robust full-length three-dimensional models of NEK10 and HspB1 and their biophysical characterization. In addition, we delineate the role of the armadillo repeats that are unique to NEK10 in the NEK family, in its interaction with HspB1. Our docking analysis shows that GLU178 of NEK10 located within its Armadillo Repeats forms a salt bridge with ARG953 of HspB1&#8217;s &#946;4\/&#946;8 groove, which is a known protein-protein interaction hot spot for both interactions with other proteins as well as for self-interactions. Our results, therefore, suggest a scenario of Nek10 interaction with HspB1 using its ARM motif, which frees the catalytic domain for auto-phosphorylation and\/or phosphorylation of other targets. Since HspB1 regulates the architecture of the cellular microtubular network (MT) by facilitating the formation of non-centrosomal MT, we speculate that the interaction of NEK10 with HspB1 plays a role in centrosome dynamics. Overall, this study shows novel and intriguing information about NEK10&#8217;s structure-function relationships, especially in the context of its interaction with HspB1. Furthermore, it establishes the framework for elucidating the detailed molecular mechanisms of NEK10 interactions with other proteins to further explore its potential as a therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a530b44-5cb9-43ed-a8b7-3adc0e7715c2\/@s03B8ZPU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Molecular modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Bioinformatics,Cell cycle,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18416"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andriele Silva<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaneen Singh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Dogs provide a unique opportunity to unravel early-stage tumor evolution, as dogs frequently develop multiple naturally occurring mammary tumors. To identify which early-stage human breast tumors will later become malignant, we analyzed mutational profiles of mammary tumors from two canine cohorts to identify patterns of tumor evolution. We compared our dog tumor signatures with human breast cancers. We found that dogs and humans share many known cancer driver mutations. Additionally, three of the five dogs with at least five mammary tumors had a single driver mutation present in most of their tumors. Despite sharing patient-level exposures and environment, passenger mutations significantly differ between these tumors, suggesting independent primaries initiated by a catalyzing factor causing the same driver mutation in each tumor. However, tumors from the same dog with the same driver gene mutations rarely exhibit the same expression-based breast cancer subtypes. Our analysis highlights the mutational similarities of dog and human breast cancers and provides insight into their development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/493b189f-52a0-4898-9699-ee97794192b1\/@s03B8ZPU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Molecular modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Cancer genomics,Mammary gland,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18417"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kiley Graim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been especially promising in resolving heterogeneity of expression programs at the single cell level but is not always available, for example for large cohort studies or longitudinal analysis of archived samples. In such cases, cell subpopulations must be inferred by deconvolution, a process that can infer single-cell genomic data from bulk data but has limited ability to resolve fine clonal structure. We extend our previous bulk genomic deconvolution tool, Robust and Accurate Deconvolution (RAD), to establish a new method, scRAD, that can use reference scRNA-seq to interpret sample collections for which only bulk RNA-seq is available for some samples, e.g., clonally resolving archived primary (PRM) tissues using scRNA-seq from metastases (METs). We preprocess scRNA-seq data to accurately represent gene expression profiles, yielding a signature matrix S then extend our RAD method via a regularization term to deconvolve bulk data while maximizing consistency with S. We validate our method on semi-synthetic data derived from human PRM breast cancer cases and bone and ovary METs, showing that scRAD improves inference of single-cell gene expression profiles and their frequencies relative to the prior RAD with random initialization or initialization using the single-cell matrix S (Table 1). We then apply scRAD to a collection of paired PRM and MET tumors to quantify progression changes in common cell types. One-sided Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that tumors inferred to increase the mast cell fraction from PRM to MET exhibit lower overall survival (p&#60;0.05), consistent with the role of mast cells in metastatic growth and propagation. Tumors that show increased macrophage cell fraction from PRM to MET show improved overall survival (p&#60;0.04), consistent with the role of immune infiltration in survival.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{45AE35A4-141F-4C3B-AE24-54D6DB0D3FC7}\"><caption>mean square error (MSE) of gene expression and mixture fraction inference on semi-simulated data<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Method<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RAD with random initialization<br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><font size=\"-1\">RAD with random initialization<\/font><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><font size=\"-1\">RAD with random initialization<\/font><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RAD initialized with S<br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><font size=\"-1\">RAD initialized with S<\/font><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><font size=\"-1\">RAD initialized with S<\/font><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">scRAD<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">scRAD<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">scRAD<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sample number<br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gene Expression&nbsp; MSE<br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.41<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.28<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.37<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.31<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.27<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.37<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.22<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.15<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.13<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mixture fraction MSE<br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.58<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.82<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.59<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.39<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.83<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.58<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.19<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.20<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.22<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f220885e-befe-410d-9213-303741e23562\/@s03B8ZPU\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Genomics,Metastasis,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18418"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haoyun Lei<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyan A.

However, the interpretation of this data is often complicated by its high dimensionality and the difficulty of identifying biological signals within a list of differentially expressed genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a community standard method for identifying pathway enrichment in gene expression data by testing whether a set of genes whose expression would indicate the activity of a specific process or phenotype are coordinately up- or downregulated more than would be expected by chance. As GSEA relies on high quality gene sets with coordinately regulated member genes, we maintain the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) which contains 9 collections of curated, annotated gene sets representing different biological pathways and processes. Over time, we have observed that some of the MSigDB gene sets, especially those that are manually curated or defined in a very specific biological context, may not provide a sensitive and specific enough co-regulation signature for their corresponding phenotype. In response, we have created a data-driven, matrix-factorization-based refinement method to build more sensitive and specific gene sets. This method incorporates large-scale datasets from multiple sources including compendia such as the Cancer Dependency Map as well as curated protein-protein interaction networks. We will present the initial results of this refinement method as well as our ongoing work which will yield a new collection of refined gene sets that will be made freely available in MSigDB for use with GSEA and many other applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd03d479-76e5-474a-bb29-2f0cdc38a53a\/@s03B8ZPU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Gene expression profiling,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18419"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander T.

Numerous clinical trials involving these therapies are underway across the world. Accurate identification and prioritization of neoantigens is highly relevant to the design of these trials, and for predicting treatment response and understanding mechanisms of resistance. With the advent of whole exome and RNA sequencing technologies, researchers and clinicians are now able to computationally predict neoantigens and design personalized vaccines based on patient-specific mutation information. However, numerous factors must be considered when prioritizing neoantigens for use in personalized medicine, including somatic variant identification and expression, peptide processing and transportation, peptide-MHC binding and stability, recognition by cytotoxic T cells, etc. There has been a rapid development of computational tools that attempt to account for these complexities. Pipelines have been developed to allow researchers to run an ensemble of many potentially informative tools for individual patients. However, output results from these complex pipelines are often unorganized, difficult to navigate and require extensive knowledge of the underlying tools for accurate interpretation. Additionally, while current pipelines analyze neoantigens from the perspective of variants, transcripts and peptides, they fail to present the underlying details for efficient prioritization of the candidates. In addition to variant detection, gene expression and predicted peptide binding affinities, recent studies have also shown the importance of mutation location, allele-specific anchor locations, and variation of T-cell response to long versus short peptides. Due to the intricate nature of neoantigen features, presenting all relevant information to experimentalists and immunogenomics tumor boards for candidate selection is a difficult challenge. In response, we have created pVACview, an interactive tool designed to aid in the prioritization and selections of neoantigen candidates for personalized cancer vaccines. pVACview has a user-friendly and intuitive interface where users can upload, explore, select and export their neoantigen candidates. The tool allows users to visualize neoantigen candidates across three different levels, including variant, transcript and peptide level information. We hope pVACview will allow researchers and clinicians to analyze and prioritize neoantigen candidates with greater efficiency and accuracy. The application is available as part of the pVACtools pipeline at https:\/\/github.com\/griffithlab\/pVACtools and the online server can be accessed at pvacview.org.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/435c924e-431e-494c-a23e-038fb34f9843\/@s03B8ZPU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Visualization Tool,Cancer immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18423"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huiming Xia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susanna Kiwala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary L.

The simultaneous detection of numerous biomarkers enables the interpretation of cellular states and the characterization of tumor-immune interactions in situ and at the single-cell level. However, image processing and the subsequent interpretive and predictive tools for multiplexed image data remain limited.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We developed a computational multiplexed-image analysis pipeline using cell-segmentation and quadrat-based approaches to analyze the spatial and temporal features of multiplexed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) images, and predict disease progression and identify clinical biomarkers. Images were obtained from nine patients with advanced\/metastatic NSCLC who were treated with the oral HDAC inhibitor vorinostat combined with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. Images were collected from all patients both pre- and on-treatment (during the third week).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Both cell-segmentation and quadrat-based approaches confirm that different spatial neighborhoods exist that distinguish progressors (PD) from non-progressors (SD): PD patients have distinct ecologies with higher colocalization of PanCK+PD-1+FoxP3 indicating an immunosuppressive environment, whereas SD patients have a higher colocalization of PanCK+PD-L1 along with T cells suggesting immunoactive tumor regions. These can be considered as potential biomarker candidates for predicting tumor progression. Further, from the single-cell analysis, we note there is a higher abundance of immune cells across the tumor border in PD patients than SD patients. Using the quadrat approach for species distribution modeling, we were able to predict treatment response with 91.4 percent accuracy given each patient&#8217;s spatial distribution of cell types from pre-treatment images. Further, we can generate risk maps for each image to identify tumor areas indicating higher probabilities of progression during treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We leveraged both single-cell and quadrat-resolution analysis of multiplexed imaging data and identified fundamentally distinct spatial ecologies between PD and SD patients. The ecology in PD patients appears to be primed for immune resistance even before treatment. This ecological diversity between SD and PD patients acts as a biomarker that enables accurate disease progression prediction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ffdd5fc4-a301-4c3c-870b-28b22c2f84b2\/@s03B8ZPU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Tumor biology,Systems biology,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18424"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sandhya Prabhakaran<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chandler Gatenbee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Robertson-Tessi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amer A.

To further complicate matters, large and complex projects require collaboration by multiple investigators examining and analyzing the massive data of multiple genomic modalities from different perspectives. Today, researchers are rarely able to reproduce published genomic studies for a variety of reasons, for example: i) differences between versions of software used, ii) lack of detail regarding software parameters, iii) lack of data access, and iv) source code not provided. Here we combine our data infrastructure approach with a molecular infrastructure and apply it to the exploration of a multimodality genomic analysis of a patient with a pulmonary pneumocytoma.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Open source methods are utilized that include the SQLite database with R and python packages and custom code.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our approach is able to generate a wide variety of plots and tables for the purposes of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and\/or other user-specific analyses, such as finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition to traditional EDA plots, the R library RCircos is used to visualize multiple NGS studies (eg, 7) in single plot. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis takes normalized RNA-based read count data and performs a statistical analysis, to find quantitative changes in expression levels between different experimental groups. A DGE analysis report is routinely generated. An abbreviated copy number variation (CNV) report derived from an ultra-low-pass whole genome (tumor\/germline) NGS approach is also generated. A Python\/Jupyter Notebook utilizing a library from scikit-learn is used to generate a <i>clustergram<\/i> plot. This approach is used as part of finding the optimal number of clusters for a K-Means analysis. RNA-seq data normalized across three sample types using DESeq2 were used in this example. Finally, advanced pathway analysis is performed for the identification of activated and deactivated molecular pathways.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The next evolution in oncology research and cancer care are being driven by data science. In the field of genomic data science, accuracy and reproducibility remains a considerable challenge due to the sheer size, complexity, and dynamic nature of the experimental data plus relative inventiveness of the quantitative biology approaches. The accuracy and reproducibility challenge does not just block the path to new scientific discoveries, more importantly, it may lead to a scenario where critical findings used for medical decision making are found to be incorrect. Our approach has been developed to meet the unmet need of improving accuracy and reproducibility in genomic data science. Specific findings related to the rare pneumocytoma tumor will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b09a9452-d0e8-4f7c-a960-b99a4d7e0551\/@s03B8ZPU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA-seq,Copy number alterations,Genomics,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18425"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Li Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erich Peterson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathew Steliga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Muesse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katy Marino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Konstantinos Arnaoutakis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ikjae Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Donald J.

Given their rare nature, compared with their small intestine (SI-NET) or pancreatic (PNET) counterpart, there have been no systematic efforts to elucidate the genetic landscape of RNETs and understand whether these tumors may present a common genetic etiology and predisposition. We have assembled a discover and a validation cohort comprising blood and tumor samples from 31 and 21 metastatic RNET patients, respectively, which was very challenging given the ultra-rare nature of these tumors. Whole-exome profiles were used to identify both<i> <\/i>rare and common germline variants that may be predictive of metastatic RNET predisposition, which is suspected to have a strong genetic component, given their frequent multifocal presentation. Among nonsynonymous rare germline variants (MAF &#60; 0.05 in the general population), 314 were significantly over-represented in the discovery cohort (FDR &#8804; 0.05), based on ethnicity-matched controls from the 1,000 Genome Project. Of these, 144 were also identified in samples from the validation cohort. Of the 40 that were statistically significant in both cohorts, 11 were deemed pathogenic by CADD Phred-scores analysis (&#8805; 20.0), including 8 in regulatory regions. This includes pathogenic variants harbored by ALKBH8, LRRC71, PSPH, MUC16, SCRT2, YARS, MICAL3, KDM6B, SYCP2L, and TTN. We validated six statistically significant variants in both cohorts by Sanger sequencing. Critically, a classifier trained on the 314 statistically significant variants in the discovery cohort produced perfect classification (area under the receiver operator curve AUROC = 1) in predicting the tumor bearing vs. healthy individuals in the validation cohort and in an equivalent number of ethnicity matched control samples, shuffled 1,000 times. Moreover, a weighted, graph-based biological pathway analysis method identified co-segregation of genes harboring tumor-predictive variants in cancer related pathways, including genome integrity, DNA replication fidelity, extracellular matrix organization, glycosylation, and the inflammasomes, among others. Taken together, these results support a common, uniquely distinctive genetic etiology for RNETs, suggesting a strong germline predisposition. More critically, the accuracy and sensitivity of the predictor suggests that these rare variants may be effectively used as a biomarker to identify individuals at risk of developing RNETs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e792c1c-a47b-4f8e-a660-7c39777ea703\/@t03B8ZPV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-07 Sequence analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Cancer genomics,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18427"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Subrata Saha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adina Grunn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Califano<\/i><\/presenter>.

Currently genetic correlation is calculated in LDSR by regressing the product of genome wide association study SNP z-scores (Ztrait1 * Ztrait2) against the SNPs calculated linkage disequilibrium scores for a population. The slope of this regression accurately estimates the genetic covariance between the two traits. Genetic covariance is then normalized to a genetic correlation. No method exists for calculating multi-trait genetic correlations. Understanding the genetic correlation between two traits, conditional on the effects of a third trait, would help clarify the correlation in traits, after removing effects from confounding variables.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To estimate genetic correlation between two traits independent of the effects of a third trait, we are developing a multiple outcome linkage disequilibrium score regression. To do this we set up a multivariate outcome regression on the linkage disequilbrium score, jointly modeling the products of z-scores for i) the trait of interest with the outcome of interest and ii) the trait of interest with the confouder. This process is similar to the steps of the usual implementation of LDSR, however in multiple outcome LDSR modeling the model coefficients, or the genetic covariances of the trait and the confounder will covary. This affords the opportunity for testing to jointly determine if the genetic covariances identified are jointly or independently significant. We have implemented this multiple outcome LDSR method and compared the results to standard outcome LDSR using data from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKBB) and the TRICL-OncoArray lung cancer (LC) consortium. We evaluated the UKBB trait of BMI and current smoking status, for their joint genetic correlation on overall LC outcomes.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Implementing LDSR, significant pairwise genetic correlation (r<sub>g<\/sub>) was observed between the UKBB trait of current smoking status, and the overall LC outcome (r<sub>g<\/sub> = 0.62 +\/- 0.06, p = 7.17x10<sup>-25<\/sup>). Similarly, significant positive genetic correlation was observed between the UKBB trait of BMI and overall LC predisposition (r<sub>g<\/sub> = 0.20 +\/- 0.03, p = 2.607x10<sup>-9<\/sup>). Using multiple outcome LDSR and jointly modeling BMI-LC susceptibility with smoking-LC susceptibility resulted in a BMI-LC genetic correlation of 0.0103, which was highly attenuated, and consistent with prior studies that show the BMI-LC association is modulated through smoking behavior.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Multiple outcome linkage disequilibrium score regression allows for multiple-trait genetic covariances to be measured simultaneously and for effect estimates to be partially mitigated for the influence of a confounder. Further validation and sensitivity analysis is warranted to determine appropriate implementations and interpretations of this novel method.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2f41850-2e01-479a-968c-3f120ab24383\/@t03B8ZPV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 Statistical methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Cancer,Statistical approach,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18428"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rowland W.

These mutations can lead to functional heterogeneity within tumors and can influence the efficacy of cancer therapy. Therefore, studying the functional characteristics and spatial distribution of genetically distinct subclones is crucial to the understanding of tumor evolution and the design of cancer treatment. Here, we present Spatioscope, a method for subclone detection using copy number profiles that can be applied to spatial transcriptomics (ST) data and data from single-cell sequencing platforms such as scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and scDNA-seq. Spatioscope implements a nested Chinese restaurant process, which mimics the tumor evolutionary process, to identify <i>de novo<\/i> subclones within one or multiple samples from the same patient. Spatioscope incorporates prior information from paired whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing (WGS\/WES) data to achieve more reliable subclone detection and malignant cell labeling. We first applied Spatioscope on ST data from breast cancer, colorectal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as on scRNA-seq from three primary and metastatic gastrointestinal tumor samples. Spatioscope successfully distinguished malignant cells from stromal cells, and identified genetically distinct subclones which were validated using matched WGS\/WES data, pathology annotations, or scDNA-seq data. On ST data, we show that Spatioscope accurately delineates the tumor&#8217;s invasive front, allowing for detailed characterization of interactions between stromal cells and malignant cells of different subclonal origins. In previous work, we showed the pervasive occurrence of highly complex subclonal allele-specific copy number alterations, and thus, we extended Spatioscope to identify subclones with different allele-specific copy number profiles. On three gastrointestinal tumor samples with scDNA-seq and two additional scATAC-seq datasets from a basal cell carcinoma and a gastric cancer cell line, Spatioscope successfully reconstructed complex recurrently mutated subclonal copy number regions. This is especially useful for data with sparse signals such as scATAC-seq when matched scDNA-seq data are unavailable. Using Spatioscope, we detected subclones based on copy number profiles in spatial and single cell tumor sequencing, enabling the investigation of the interplay between genome, transcriptome, and spatial environment during tumor evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cf43a0c7-e66f-4b14-b1b9-6ba33a9dd392\/@t03B8ZPV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 Statistical methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Tumor microenvironment,Copy number alterations,Statistical approach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18429"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chi-Yun Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul R.

Previously, we have developed a high throughput single cell DNA analysis platform that leverages droplet microfluidics and a multiplex-PCR based targeted DNA sequencing approach. It demonstrates high sensitivity detection of SNVs and indels in the same cells and generation of high resolution maps of clonal architecture based on mutational profiling. Here we expand upon the same approach and create an algorithm to accurately quantify CNVs along with genetic mutations from the same single cells. To estimate the CNV the amplicon read counts were corrected for artefacts related to cell to cell variability due sequencing efficiencies along with amplicon to amplicon variability that occur due to amplification efficiency differences. We used a spiked in diploid cell line as a reference to normalize all the cells. The spiked cell line was identified using its mutational profile. We validated the system using cell lines with known CNVs and found that we could at least accurately estimate copy numbers ranging from 0 through 5. Some of the regions were also validated orthogonally using droplet digital PCR. Another set of validation was performed using well characterized cell lines from NIST. We enable multiple visualizations of the copy number estimates in karyotype plots and line plots projected on SNV clones. With improved biochemistry, panel design and novel data analysis algorithms we develop a complete solution to detect amplification or loss of function in oncogenes and tumor suppressors reliably. Integration of CNVs and SNVs facilitates more accurate reconstruction of tumor evolution to better understand cancer progression mechanisms as well for quality control of gene edited cells, to further advance cancer research and therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19004"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Saurabh Parikh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khushali Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anup Parikh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Also, RNAseq technology has been used for two purposes: to find exonic regions on the genome and quantify the expression level of the gene. We tried to validate the pipeline for identifying somatic variants from RNA-seq data, mainly following GATK4 somatic calling pipelines with some optimizing modifications. It is intended to examine whether somatic mutations driven from RNAseq data are associated with the biological behaviors of the individual colorectal cancer cells. We found that key genes (i.e., tumor suppressor genes such as APC and p53) are mostly mutated by T to C (in the non-coding region) or C to T (in the coding region) transitions, so that causes missense and nonsense mutations. However, highly mutated genes did not show significant expressional changes compared to the normal tissue. Otherwise, genes related to the metastatic potentials were observed to have highly increased expression. Our results can substantially verify the reliability of the somatic mutation calling approach using RNAseq data to call cancer-driving mutation and confirm an increase of extracellular matrix metabolism in the CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d491e7f2-b5cd-4efb-b849-36767e23174d\/@t03B8ZPV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-01 Analytic pipeline optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Somatic mutations,Differential gene expression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20801"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ji Won Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kwangsung Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sangsoo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Il Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soo-kyung Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, these trials fail to represent real-life practice where patients have additional diseases (comorbidities) and commonly use numerous drugs when entering the clinic. Therefore, there is a rise of interest in combinational therapies, also because effective combinations are expected to prevent therapy resistance. At this moment it is not feasible to predict the adverse events of new combination therapies due to lack of available information both from a dimensionality (i.e., number of adverse events recorded per patient) as well as from a patient-number perspective. When available, this information allows to choose combinational therapies with acceptable adverse events.<br \/>In this study we developed a preliminary method to predict adverse events of drug combinations in order to select combinations with a mild adverse event profile.<br \/>We used the FAERS, an FDA post-marketing adverse events registry as data source containing 15 million adverse-event records. First, we developed a method to visualize the adverse events profiles of monotherapy and combination therapy using dimension reduction to accurately represent the relation between adverse events over many patients. These adverse-event profiles are then fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate an explainable prediction-model for adverse events occurring in combination therapies.<br \/>The CNN trained on monotherapy is able to learn from the data and recognize adverse event patterns. The learned pattern information, as stored in the so-called latent space, can be converted back onto the original adverse event profiles. This showed a high similarity to the original data, also for unseen combination therapy effects. Furthermore, a t-SNE analysis on the latent space of the CNN is able to separate additive and synergistic adverse event patterns in combination therapy.<br \/>Our CNN model can successfully learn complex adverse-event patterns for single drugs and their combinations, which are all encoded in the latent space. The developed method is therefore applicable to determine the combinatorial effects of highly complex adverse event profiles.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d4b377e2-d362-4d3b-86e7-7f9208da68b4\/@t03B8ZPV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Machine learning,Combination therapy,Toxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21215"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Asli Kucukosmanoglu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Scoarta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Wijnands<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Kanev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bart Westerman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bert Kiewit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Noske<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Wurdinger<\/i><\/presenter>.

Characterization of the variable protein forms, or proteoforms will expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases, however requires unbiased protein coverage at sufficient scale. Scalable, deep and unbiased proteomics studies have been impractical due to cumbersome and lengthy workflows required for complex samples, like blood plasma. Here, we demonstrate the power of Proteograph in a proof-of-concept proteogenomic analysis of 80 healthy controls and 61 early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples to dissect differences between protein isoforms arising from alternative gene splicing, as well as the identification of novel peptides arising from allelic variation.<br \/>Materials, Methods and Results: Processing the 141 plasma samples with Proteograph yielded 21,959 peptides corresponding to 2,499 protein groups. Using peptides with significant abundance differences (p &#38;lt; 0.05; Benjamini-Hochberg corrected), we extracted proteins comprised of peptides where at least one peptide had significantly higher plasma abundance, and another significantly lower plasma abundance in controls vs. cancer, resulting in a set of putative proteoforms. For three of these proteins, the abundance variation is possibly explained by underlying protein isoforms. To identify protein variants, we performed exome sequencing on 29 individuals from the NSCLC study, created personalized mass spectrometry search libraries for each individual, and identified 464 protein variants.<br \/>Conclusions: Proteograph can generate unbiased and deep plasma proteome profiles that enable identification of protein variants and peptides present in plasma, at a scale sufficient to enable population-scale proteomic studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55b4af9c-98ea-4eea-b40b-83fc8c940c5c\/@t03B8ZPV\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Genomics,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21404"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Margaret Donovan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henry Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Blume<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marwin Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Benz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theodore Platt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Cuevas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Serafim Batzoglou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asim Siddiqui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omid Farokhzad<\/i><\/presenter>.

The standard methodology to identify patient specific neoantigens relies on computational algorithms for analyzing mutation, expression, and HLA profiles from patients&#8217; NGS data. However, clinical reports have thus far showed that the number of actionable neoantigens was not as high as originally expected. One possible reason is due to a lack of appropriate prediction models, especially for immunogenicity, which is largely hindered by a scarcity of training data based on <i>in vivo <\/i>vaccination models. In addition, HLA allele status and\/or impurity and heterogeneity in tumor samples are other factors affecting the selection efficiency.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We have developed a computational pipeline to identify neoantigens from patients&#8217; WES and RNA-Seq data. Our HLA assessment not only determines HLA types but also detects HLA LOH events from WES and down-regulation of HLA gene expression from RNA-Seq taking into account tumor purity. The neoantigen candidates were ranked based on a presentation score calculated by a regression model optimized with publicly available immunopeptidome data. We tested our top-ranked neoantigen peptides by immunizing them into HLA-A02:01, A24:02, B07:02, and B35:01-transgenic mice and performed ELISPOT to determine positive or negative <i>in vivo<\/i> immune responses. Furthermore, we trained a neural network to define an immunogenicity score based on the results from the transgenic mouse experiments.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We generated NGS data from over 100 clinical samples and analyzed the data using our computational pipeline. We observed a wide range in the tumor mutational burden and tumor purity of our samples, and HLA LOH was frequently observed. From 27 patient cases, 275 of HLA-A02:01-, A24:02-, B07:02-, or B35:01-predicted neoantigen epitopes were tested in transgenic mice and confirmed that the rate of positively reacted epitopes increased in a correlated manner to the presentation score, achieving 82% positive rate in top scored 35 epitopes and 47% in overall 275 epitopes. We further developed an immunogenicity prediction model and tested its performance in additional clinical samples. By integrating it into the selection criteria, we achieved higher positive rate than using the presentation score solely.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We have developed a robust computational pipeline to identify putatively actionable neoantigens from patients&#8217; WES and RNA-Seq data. We detected frequent HLA LOH events indicating that this is a common mechanism of immune evasion. We also showed the feasibility of improving prediction algorithms using HLA-transgenic mice. Accurate prediction performance enables us to decrease the number of vaccine antigens to be immunized per patient, leading to a decrease in the manufacturing cost and complexity in quality control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6022202-8f02-41cd-a5c6-46ba04641753\/@t03B8ZPV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-01 Analytic pipeline optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Machine learning,HLA LOH,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21653"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kazushi Hiranuka<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keigo Takahashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dave Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noriko Watanabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Yamada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuji Mishima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norihiro Fujinami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manami Shimomura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshihiro Suzuki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tetsuya Nakatsura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norihiro Nakamura<\/i><\/presenter>.

The attributes of the CGC designed to democratize data analysis also make it ideal for training the next generation of data scientists. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become clear that remote\/virtual learning is of great importance for workforce development, and that reducing barriers to high quality educational resources is critical for many populations. Here we present our best practices for education of bioinformatics using the CGC, taking advantage of both distributed cloud networks and platform features to enhance learning.<br \/>Our best practices methods are focused on a systematic approach that takes the instructor and students through a typical bioinformatics workflow in their field of research. Briefly, the organizational structure of the CGC, known as &#8220;projects,'' contains all aspects of an analysis, including data files, tools, and tool settings. Projects have fine-grained permission settings, which allow the owner to securely share their project for viewing or editing. An instructor can generate an example analysis from start to finish then share an entire project with trainees. Both students and instructors have access to the same data on the cloud, so the teacher can pre-populate the projects with specific files, ensuring the same starting point. All members within the project can communicate, including adding notes directly on the results, allowing students to troubleshoot in real time with the teacher. Instructors can manage costs for the whole class through the CGC&#8217;s billing system. The CGC also provides Public Projects for self-guided training, where a researcher can learn by example using the data, tools, and completed tasks within the project, including detailed instructions embedded in markdown language.<br \/>We have successfully used these methods to train masters students in bioinformatics at Georgetown University for three years, as well as high school students, college students, and current cancer researchers.<br \/>This approach to virtual learning of bioinformatics can democratize training for the next generation of data scientists. The FAIR practices built into the CGC enables education across all levels of expertise, empowering users to drive cancer research from any stage of their career.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f3a7e315-fe3d-4a13-890c-3e703d8717a1\/@t03B8ZPV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21677"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manisha Ray<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sai Lakshmi Subramanian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Roberson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zelia Worman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis A.

The Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC), powered by Seven Bridges, offers many helpful features to simplify and streamline the performance of machine learning (ML) tasks on the platform. The CGC platform contains features and tools for all of the steps of a ML project, from data exploration, to model generation, to production, so that all key steps occur on the platform. The Data Cruncher interactive analysis tool enables users to perform data exploration, modeling, training, and visualization using familiar frameworks like Jupyterlab and RStudio. We applied this ML methodology to imaging tools, to create The SB Image Processing Toolkit. Here we demonstrate the use of this toolkit with specific cancer datasets, including training and analysis, with all steps taking place on the cloud.<br \/>The SB Image Processing Toolkit is a collection of various deep-learning, preprocessing, and utility tools and workflows created with the purpose of performing image class prediction on any type of image data. The toolkit supports a variety of images used in cancer research, such as histopathology and radiology images, and common formats like JPG or PNG. There are nine distinct tools within the toolkit, including methods for quality control, normalization, preprocessing for histopathology or radiology images, classification, and deep learning. Together, these tools create an easy-to-use infrastructure to enable various stages of ML and Image Processing. Most importantly, it was designed to enable users to create and use ML image classifiers on the CGC without any coding experience. All workflows can be searched for and implemented via the Public Apps Gallery on the CGC. Users can import image data, run analysis, and compare results all in one environment.<br \/>By harnessing the scale and flexibility of cloud computing, the SB Image Processing Toolkit brings massive speed and price improvements compared to manual writing and running model training scripts. In conjunction with the access to data and ease of use, the CGC makes complex machine learning methods accessible to any researcher.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ffa4151a-6f73-4e9c-9ad6-410bb67b42d7\/@t03B8ZPV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Bioinformatics,Image analysis,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21678"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Soner Koc<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jovana Babic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nevena Nikolic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Stankovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Ventre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manisha Ray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zelia F.

While traditional linear genome browsers have demonstrated broad utility for many applications, there is an increasing need for visualizing complex structural variants (SVs) beyond the linear view. To meet these challenges, we created JBrowse 2: an extensible open-source platform for visualizing and integrating genomic data.<br \/>Results: JBrowse 2 is a flexible platform that provides the foundation for the development of applications and web dashboards that combine novel views and representations extending beyond linear displays in genomic reference coordinates. For example, a flagship JBrowse 2 application is the SV Inspector, which lets users open a list of structural variants in a data table and see the results in a whole-genome circular view. Clicking on a given variant in the table or circular view opens up a linear view that displays the read evidence supporting the SV, even across complex breakpoints like translocations. Dotplot and synteny views are built-in, enabling &#8220;long read vs reference&#8221; dotplot visualizations, or alignments of de-novo assembled contigs to the genome. These views are integrated with each other, so that (for example) a long read is just a few clicks away from the corresponding dotplot.<br \/>In addition to including these new views, the JBrowse 2 platform is designed from the ground up to enable third-party plugins to add new views, data adapters, and track types, which has facilitated the creation of new plugins that address some very specific use cases. These include our MSA view plugin for viewing multiple sequence alignments, data adapters that download data from UCSC and CIVIC APIs, and the Quantseq plugin for viewing quantitative motif scores as a genome browser track.<br \/>JBrowse 2 is available as both a web app or a local desktop app. We also offer re-usable components on NPM, and users of R can programmatically create an instance of JBrowse 2 with the JBrowseR package on CRAN. JBrowse 2 can also generate high quality SVG snapshots from inside the app, and we also created a CLI tool called jb2export to perform automated or bulk exports of JBrowse 2 visualizations. We anticipate that JBrowse 2 will better serve genome scientists with its structural variant visualization capabilities, and will provide the flexibility to adapt to new visualization and analysis challenges as they emerge in the coming years.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40fc9ee4-e581-4dc4-bbce-3a0bc4596d8a\/@t03B8ZPV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome,Genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21729"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Scott Cain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robin Haw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Bridge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junjun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Buels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colin Diesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Garrett Stevens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa Martinez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter K.

Kids First has two initiatives, which are whole genome sequencing (WGS) of biospecimens from families with CC\/SBD, and establishing Kids First Data Resource. Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC) developed Kids First Data Resource Portal (KFDRP; https:\/\/portal.kidsfirstdrc.org\/), which is a centralized platform to search, view, analyze, and identify currently accessible data from both Kids First and collaborative cohorts, incorporating omics and phenotypic information of 30 studies and 26,300 participants. Recently KFDRC released two new KFDRP components named Variant DataBase (VDB) and Variant WorkBench (VWB), enabling users to query, mangle, analyze and visualize germline genomic variants. The current release includes ~309 million unique variants in a matrix of more than 61.3 billion individual-chromosomal position occurrences from over 11,500 participants in 17 studies. While VDB provides a quick variant summary, VWB supports scripting languages such as Python, Spark, SQL, R, and MarkDown as in-depth analysis tools enabled by Apache Zeppelin notebooks. In addition to variant calls and phenotypic information such as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms and Mondo IDs, VWB hosts rich external variant annotations in the public domain, such as Cancer Hotspots, ClinVar, COSMIC, dbNSFP, gnomAD, TOPMed, as well as gene-phenotype links provided by OMIM, HPO, Orphanet, and the Deciphering Developmental Disorders Project. Users can also load additional databases within a notebook (such as the subscription-based Human Gene Mutation Database [HGMD]), import custom datasets as temporary query tables, export analysis outputs to local drives, visualize analysis results in multiple chart styles, display local figures, and save notebooks for sharing, further use and Cavatica projects. In an effort to screen tier 1 genes (n=578) from the most recent Cancer Gene Census provided by COSMIC for rare deleterious variants in all six currently available CC cohorts in KFDRP, we identified over 1.2 million germline variants that are with minor allele frequency no more than 0.00001 among gnomAD\/TOPMed datasets and with ratio of number of &#8220;damaging&#8221; predictions over number of all predictions in dbNSFP between 0.5 and 1, or that are already cataloged in the most recent version of ClinVar\/HGMD. The whole process took less than two hours which is much faster than conventional methods. These variant tools in KFDRP enable efficient genomic variant analysis in cancer research with advanced big data technology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a0026db-8c4f-40aa-8f27-3afcea5c021e\/@u03B8ZPW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Pediatric cancers,Databases,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19956"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yiran Guo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Costanza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Botek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miguel Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Higgins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuankun Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bailey Farrow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison Heath<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Resnick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Ferretti<\/i><\/presenter>, Kids First Data Resource Center.

Each tool claimed its specific advantages comparing to others. Some tools present their efficiency on accurately identifying indels, while some others are good at detecting large and complicated structural variants. For a data analyst, especially for those have limited expertise on sequential algorithms, how to choose a suitable variant caller that fits for the owned data? To facilitate the data analysis, here, we developed and presented an automatic recommendation system. When the system is given a sequencing data (BAM\/SAM file), it suggests a variant caller that may perform best, from a set of state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools. The proposed recommendation system is developed under a machine learning framework, which is called meta-learning technique. The meta-learning method enables the system to identify the associations between the features from data and the performance of tools. To achieve this, the meta-learning method consists of the following two steps: First, the method (1) extracts the metadata from the training dataset. Here, the metadata includes meta-feature collection and meta-target identification. When the training dataset is large enough, a comprehensive meta-database is obtained. Then, it (2) constructs a recommendation model according to the meta-database. As a tool has only two recommendation status, the recommendation model can be built by a classification approach. We adopted RandomForest in the system. When a new sequencing data is given to the system, it applies meta-feature collection on the data, then the recommendation is offered according to the classification results mainly on meta-features. In addition, different scenarios may have different preference on variant calling performance. We considered 3 meta-targets, which are F-measure, precision and recall. When F-measure is set to meta-target, the variant caller that may present highest F-measure is recommended. The settings for the precision and recall are similar, respectively. We conducted a series of experiments to test the validity of the proposed recommendation system. We selected 5 popular variant callers for PacBio sequencing data. The training data was generated by published simulator. The validation data included both the simulated data and the real data with benchmarks of structural variants. The experimental results indicated that different variant callers often fit for different data, while none of the callers seems efficient for every data. For the recommendation system, the F-measure and AUC could reach 76.90% and 90.80% in some tests, respectively and the recommendation accuracy kept more than 90% on average.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bce71784-eac0-4feb-bc02-83c29272ea50\/@u03B8ZPW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-07 Sequence analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sequencing,Machine learning,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19957"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shenjie Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyan Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuqian Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jiayin Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

JBrowse 2 is a JavaScript genome browser with novel features for visualizing structural variants, syntenic alignments, and multiple types of genomic data. Although JBrowse 2 is available as a web-based or desktop application, the capabilities and features are not fixed and can be expanded through a comprehensive plugin system. To help address users' needs, we launched the new JBrowse 2 Plugin Store (https:\/\/jbrowse.org\/jb2\/plugin_store\/). The overarching goals of the Plugin Store are to showcase the crucial features plugins add to JBrowse 2, to enable researchers to search for plugins they need, and for developers to highlight their plugins. The plugin system spans all aspects of the JBrowse 2 application and enables new track types (e.g. Manhattan plots, Hi-C data, ideograms), data adapters (e.g. API endpoint adapters for NCI Genomic Data Commons and the International Cancer Genome Consortium), and views (e.g. dot plots and multiple sequence alignments). Here, we present the capabilities of JBrowse 2 plugins and describe usage scenarios for cancer biologists and bioinformaticians, and software developers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1de8b291-ddd7-42c8-ab53-87799f119d2c\/@u03B8ZPW\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome,Genomics,Bioinformatics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19988"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robin Andrew Haw<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colin Diesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Bridge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rob Buels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Garrett Stevens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa Martinez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elliot Hershberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junjun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shihab Dider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Cain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lincoln Stein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Holmes<\/i><\/presenter>.

The electronic analysis notebook has recently emerged as a versatile tool for this purpose, allowing scientists to combine the scientific exposition with the code that runs the analysis, creating a single &#8220;research narrative&#8221; document. The Jupyter Notebook system has become the<i> de facto<\/i> standard notebook environment in data science and genomic analysis. However, the Jupyter environment requires familiarity with programming to run analyses, and even text must be formatted using a programming-style language.To extend notebook capabilities to researchers at all levels of programming expertise, we developed the GenePattern Notebook environment, which integrates Jupyter with the hundreds of genomic tools available through the GenePattern<u><sup> <\/sup><\/u>platform. This tool allows scientists to develop, share, collaborate on, and publish their notebooks, requiring only a web browser. Investigators can design their&nbsp;<i>in-silico&nbsp;<\/i>experiments, refine workflows, launch compute-intensive analyses on cloud-based and high-performance compute resources, and publish results that others can adopt to reproduce the original analyses and modify for their own work.GenePattern Notebook provides:<b> <\/b>(1) Access to a wide range of genomic analyses within a notebook. Hundreds of analyses are available, from machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification, and dimension reduction, to omic-specific methods for gene expression analysis, proteomics, flow cytometry, sequence variation analysis, pathway analysis, and others. (2) A library of featured genomic analysis notebooks, including templates for common analysis tasks as well as cancer-specific research scenarios and compute-intensive methods. Scientists can easily copy these notebooks, use them as is, or adapt them for their research purposes. To support the growing role of single-cell analysis, we have recently released single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing, cluster harmonization, pseudotime, and RNA velocity notebooks.<b> <\/b>(3) Notebook enhancements. A rich text editor allows scientists to format text as they would in a word processor. A user interface-building tool allows notebook developers to wrap code so it is displayed as a web form, with only the necessary inputs exposed. (4) Publication and collaborative editing.&nbsp;Authors can publish their notebooks, where they are then made available on the community section of the notebook workspace, where other scientists may copy, run, and edit their own version.The GenePattern Notebook environment is freely available at <u>http:\/\/genepattern-notebook.org<\/u><u><\/u>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71eca845-7954-44be-94d2-8b651c12aea1\/@u03B8ZPW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Single cell,Systems biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21759"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael M.

Here, mining single cell transcriptomics datasets of solid tumors, we survey many existing CAR targets, aiming to identify new solid tumor types in which these targets are differentially expressed in tumor cells and not on non-tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment, thus providing new repurposing opportunities. Quite surprisingly, we find that many existing solid cancer CAR targets have a better discriminatory power in uncharted cancer types than in the ones they have been developed or being tested for. Furthermore, we show that several existing liquid cancer CAR targets may also hold promise in specific solid tumors. Taken together, this analysis uncovers a large potential of repurposing current CARs that is currently yet untapped.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9cb5832d-8bfe-4989-b9ad-967d6baf0792\/@u03B8ZPW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Single cell,Bioinformatics,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21761"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanna Madan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandro Schäffer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eytan Ruppin<\/i><\/presenter>.
