[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> HER3 (ErbB-3) is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and its overexpression is associated with poorer prognosis in several cancer types. It is unclear whether HER3 expression status changes in tumor tissue at relapse. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in HER3 expression between initial diagnosis and recurrence in gynecologic cancers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This retrospective study included gynecologic cancer patients with matched paired tissues at the time of initial diagnosis and at the time of recurrence between 1999 and 2019 at National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for HER3 was performed using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. The primary antibody was HER3\/ErbB3 (D22C5) XP Rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technology). HER3-positive was defined as an IHC score of 2+ or 3+, and HER3-negative was an IHC score of 0 or 1+, scored according to HER2 testing guidelines for gastroesophageal cancer. The H-score (range, 0-300) was calculated using the following formula: 3X+2Y+Z, where X, Y, and Z are the percentage of tumor cells showing strong, moderate, and weak staining intensity. The difference in HER3 expression between initial diagnosis and recurrence was evaluated using the &#967;2 test.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Eighty-six patients with gynecologic cancers were included (40 ovarian; 32 endometrial; 14 cervical). In ovarian cancer, 67.5% and 80.0% of the patients were HER3-positive at initial diagnosis and recurrence, respectively. There was a statistically significant increase in H-Score at recurrence (p=0.004). The HER3-positive rate in patients with endometrial cancer increased from 46.9% at initial diagnosis to 68.8% at recurrence, and H-Score tended to increase at recurrence (p=0.08). Twelve of the 14 patients (85.7%) with cervical cancer were HER3-positive, both at initial diagnosis and at recurrence, and H-Score tended to increase at recurrence (p=0.19). The discordance rate of HER3 expression determination in samples at initial diagnosis and recurrence was 27.5%, 46.9%, and 14.3% for ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our findings suggest that HER3 expression may increase at recurrence in patients with gynecologic cancers. HER3-targeted therapy may represent a promising option to overcome treatment failure and improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/399b01b0-3037-4912-a947-b6c502a6ced9\/@x03B8ZQB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Endometrial cancer,Cervical cancer,ErbB3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17535"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuki Kojima<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuki Sudo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Yoshida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shu Yazaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Momoko Tokura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shosuke Kita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kasumi Yamamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiharu Mizoguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hitomi S Okuma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tadaaki Nishikawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emi Noguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatsunori Shimoi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuhito Tanase<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masaya Uno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitsuya Ishikawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomoyasu Kato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kumiko Koyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maki Kobayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomoya Kakegawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuhiro Fujiwara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kan Yonemori<\/i><\/presenter>.

Nevertheless, due to adverse drug reactionsthe molecular high heterogeneity of TNBC and no appropriate meaningful efficacy markers, it is still difficult to establish preferred therapeutic strategies and predict the outcomes for TNBC. This study was to investigate the potential predictors and therapeutic targets based on genetic features.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A total of 386 TNBC patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either six cycles of paclitaxel + cisplatin (TP) or four cycles of epirubicin + cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel (EC-T) adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery (NCT01150513), which were described previously. Finally, 149 TNBC patients with clinical and tumor sequencing data availability were retrospectively analysed by NGS for 733 cancer-related genes. All tumor samples were collected during the surgical operation and subjected to NGS for evaluating genomic mutations and the potential predictors. Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier method were applied to evaluate disease-free survival (DFS).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the surgical cohort receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, 74 patients received platinum and 75 received platinum-free chemotherapy as adjuvant chemotherapy.

Recent studies have shown that TGF&#946; can drive immune-excluded phenotype in tumor microenvironment (TME) by restricting CD8+ T cell infiltration; thus, tumors with an immune-excluded phenotype or high TGF&#946; levels may be particularly responsive to TGF&#946; blockade. Here we combine analysis of intra-tumoral and peripheral TGF&#946; levels with digital pathology-based immune-phenotyping, which might serve as an integrated approach to identify patients most likely to benefit from TGF&#946; blockade.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>About 200 NSCLC FFPE tumor blocks with matching fresh frozen tumor and plasma were purchased from commercial sources. Quantitation of peripheral and intra-tumoral TGF&#946; (TGF&#946;1\/2\/3) levels was performed using a qualified assay for active and total forms. FFPE slides were stained for CD8+ T cells (SP57, Ventana) and scanned at 40x using the Aperio AT2 scanner by Covance. Machine learning (ML) models were developed using the digitized whole slide images to identify CD8+, CD8-, and non-lymphocytes, as well as cancer epithelium, cancer-associated stroma, and artifacts. Data-driven cutoffs were applied to model-generated human-interpretable features (HIFs) of CD8+ lymphocyte density to classify samples as desert, excluded, or inflamed. As an orthogonal approach to the CD8+ density-based cutoff method, all tissue and cell model predictions were used to train a graph neural network (GNN) to classify immune phenotypes.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>We found that TGF&#946;1 was the predominant isoform detected within the periphery while TGF&#946;1 and TGF&#946;2 were measurable in majority of tumor samples; TGF&#946;3 level was below the detection limit in most samples. Correlation analysis of TGF&#946;1 expression in plasma and tumor shows poor concordance in the matched samples, which could be due to the relatively lower level of intra-tumoral TGF&#946; and tumor heterogeneity. This discordance may explain why it is challenging to use plasma TGF&#946; to predict tumor TGF&#946; level. ML model quantification of CD8+, CD8-, and non-lymphocytes showed high concordance with the consensus score of 5 independent pathologists on a test set of held-out samples not used in training. This concordance was comparable to that of individual annotators to consensus. Immune-phenotyping results using both cutoff and GNN methods also showed moderate concordance with 5-way pathologist consensus.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>We coupled a ligand binding assay for assessing TGF&#946; isoforms in both plasma and TME with an ML-powered digital pathology platform that can provide a standardized, scalable, and reproducible method to characterize cancer-immune phenotypes in TME. This integrative approach might identify potential biomarkers to select NSCLC patients that may benefit from TGF&#946; blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f18096b-3749-4956-b441-e02f506fee72\/@z03B8ZQD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Predictive biomarkers,TGF-&#946;,Immunoassay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17552"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"b023fad9-4b2e-44e8-b572-d9c5970a0bb2","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b023fad9-4b2e-44e8-b572-d9c5970a0bb2\/@z03B8ZQD\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Robert Pomponio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carrie Hendricks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Mitchell Bean<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergine Brutus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Biddle-Snead<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Archit Khosla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Stanford-Moore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cyrus Hedvat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roger Trullo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brigitte Demers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Rui Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The mutation of CREBBP has been reported that caused Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) and associated with acute myeloid leukemia, but not been studied in bladder cancer (BLCA). Immune checkpoint therapy (ICI) has significantly became one of the primary treatment of BLCA, and Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been regarded as the most prevalent biomarker to predict immunotherapy. The CREBBP mutation status correlation with TMB and immune response remain unknown.<br \/>Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) data and clinical data of 406 BLCA patients was obtained from the Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA). The mutation data of 206 FFPE tumor samples from Chinese BLCA patients were sequenced by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS, 3DMed panel). NGS data and clinical data of 192 advanced BLCA patients treated with ICI were obtained from the MSK-IMPACT Clinical Sequencing cohort (MSKCC). The association between CREBBP mutation and TMB level in BLCA were explored. Survival analysis was determined by Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis.<br \/>Results: In total, The CREBBP mutation frequency was 16.25% (66\/406) of BLCA patients in TCGA, 14.56% (30\/206) in Chinese cohort and 13.54 (26\/192). In Chinese cohort, the alteration frequency of NOTCH signal pathways affected was 48.54% (100\/206), in which the highest frequency genes was CREBBP. The TMB level in CREBBP mutant group was higher than wild-type group both in Chinese group (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.001) and MSKCC cohort (Wilcoxon test, p &#60; 0.001). The survival analysis were performed on patients from TCGA cohorts without treatment information and MSKCC BLCA patients treated with ICIs, separately. In TCGA cohort, there are not significantly difference between CREBBP mutation group (n=65) and wild-type group (n=340). While in MSKCC ICIs treatment cohort, the overall survival (OS) of CREBBP mutation group (n=26) were significantly longer than wild-type group (n=166) (median OS, mutation vs wild-type = NE vs 15 months; HR 0.468 [95% CI 0.26-0.84]; P = 0.0431). Conclusion: The CREBBP gene mutation was associated with higher TMB level. Clinical cohort analysis results suggested that CREBBP might be a predictive biomarker of immune checkpoint therapy but not a prognostic factor in BLCA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6f27c1c-aff0-4469-8342-a4db4c406832\/@z03B8ZQD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,CREBBP,TMB,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17555"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Abai Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tingting Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

PCa is the sixth most common cancer in Taiwan, and its incidence rate has increased gradually over the past 30 years. PAPR inhibitors are the only type of targeted drug approved by the FDA to treat advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that has grown after the hormone therapy drugs. This study aimed to characterize the genomic profile of Taiwanese PCa and explore whether there are potential treatment guidances derived.<br \/>Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues from 99 patients diagnosed with PCa and collected at Chi-Mei Medical Center (CMMC) were subject to next-generation sequencing using ACTOnco&#174; CGP panel that cover coding regions of 440 cancer-related genes. Genomic alterations (GAs) and signatures, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (InDels), copy-number variations (CNVs), fusion genes, tumor mutations burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were retrieved. The gene mutation prevalence was compared with the Western population using the TCGA prostate cancer dataset.<br \/>Results: A total of 1558 variants was identified, including 215 SNVs, 22 InDels, 1178 CN gain and 135 homozygous deletions. Similar to the Western population, the most frequently mutated genes were <i>SPOP<\/i> (21.2%), <i>KMT2C<\/i> (10.1%), <i>MUC16<\/i> (8.1%), <i>TP53 <\/i>(6.1%), <i>ARID2 <\/i>(5.1%), <i>IDH1<\/i> (5.1%), <i>PTGS2<\/i> (5.1%). Further analysis showed that 12 patients harbored deleterious\/likely deleterious mutations in genes implicated in homologous recombination (HRR) DNA repair pathway, including three <i>BRCA2<\/i>, two<i> CDK12<\/i>, <i>BRAD1<\/i> and <i>ARID1A<\/i>, respectively, and one <i>ATR<\/i>, <i>ATM <\/i>and <i>PALB2<\/i>, respectively. All <i>BRCA2<\/i> mutations were predicted to be germline origin and only one-third of 12 HRR mutants had a biallelic gene loss. Median TMB calculated from NGS data is 0.6 muts\/Mb (range 0 to 4.5) and all samples are microsatellite-stable (MSS). Therapeutically actionable gene and pathway analysis revealed that up to 24.2% of patients harbored at least one aberration against FDA-approved targeted drugs, such as MET copy number (CN) gain (11.1%), mTOR pathway aberration (6.1%), HRR gene biallelic loss (4%), BRAF activating mutation (4%), IDH1 activating mutations (4%), EGFR CN gain (3.0%), FGFR1 CN gain (2.0%), MET fusion (1.0%) and BRAF fusion (1%).<br \/>Conclusion: This CGP study unraveled the genomic profile of Taiwanese prostate cancers, and the results showed that GAs identified could serve as a potential biomarker to guide personalized, targeted therapies in one-fourth of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c727cc34-26e0-4109-b825-a63b8fe23001\/@z03B8ZQD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Targeted therapies,Comprehensive genomic profiling,PARP inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17556"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kien Thiam Tan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Ling Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yen-Jung Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ka-Po Tse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chien-Feng L Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

Urine cytology and existing markers have insufficient diagnostic performance. Here, we used medium-sized extracellular vesicles (EVs) in urine to find specific markers for UCB and evaluate their usefulness as diagnostic material.<br \/><b>Experimental Design:<\/b> To search for specific markers in urinary EVs derived from UCB, we performed a comparative analysis using shotgun proteomics with urine from four UCB patients and four healthy subjects. Next, we used male 24 healthy specimens, 18 non-cancer specimens, and 29 UCB specimens for analysis of urinary EVs using a flow cytometer to evaluate the diagnostic performance of UCB-specific EVs.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. NTA analysis showed that the size of EVs extracted from urine by centrifugation was mostly less than 400 nm. By shotgun analysis of EVs, we detected several proteins characteristic of UCB and found that CEACAM proteins was increased in patients. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the degree of expression of CEACAM1, 5, and 6 antigens on the surface of EVs varied among patients. EVs expressing CEACAM antigens also expressed MUC1, suggesting that they were derived from tumorigenic uroepithelial cells. The number of EVs expressing CEACAM1, 5, and 6 proteins (CEACAMs+EVs) was significantly increased in UCB (Mean9.5%&#177;SD14%), non-bladder cancer (0.69&#177;0.46), and healthy (0.37&#177;0.31) by flow cytometry. The results of ROC analysis showed a good score of AUC=0.929. A provisional CEACAMs+EVs cutoff % was established with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 98%. Here, seven out of nine cases of negative urine cytology (class 2) were determined to be positive.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The presence of CEA antigen in the urine of patients with bladder cancer is known, but it has not yet been practically used for diagnosis. We have discovered EVs that specifically express these antigens and have obtained useful diagnostic performance.

Tumoral heterogeneity together with tissue of origin related genomic alterations adds complexity to genomic profiling. The value of NGS panels capable of detecting variants in both tissue and ctDNA are well recognized. Therefore, it is essential to assess the comprehensive NGS panel(s) performance in both liquid biopsy and tissue by comparing to tissue WES. In this study, we systematically conducted performance evaluation of llumina TruSight&#8482; Oncology 500 gene (TSO500) NGS assay(s) using matched tissue and ctDNA specimens<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Matched tissue and plasma samples from seven treatment naive stage III\/IV CRC patients were utilized for Illumina TSO500 sequencing and WES. Tissue samples were separately analyzed by both WES and the TSO500 tissue panel while extracted cfDNA was analyzed by TSO500 ctDNA panel. Illumina BaseSpace TruSight Oncology 500 platform (<i>CombinedVariantOutput.tsv<\/i>) was applied to select non-synonymous (frameshift, in-frame, nonsense, missense, translation start site, nonstop and splice site) variants in both cfDNA and tissue samples. Genes found to be mutated by tissue WES were filtered for corresponding mutated genes detected by TSO500 analysis. Next, using maftools, we characterize the most frequently mutated genes and the mutations observed for each patient sample.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 1,300 variants and 33 copy number variants were observed in the liquid biopsy samples whereas 1,199 variants, 9 genes with high copy number variations and 3 gene fusions were observed in the TSO500 tissue panel. Of these mutations, 889 variants (56.9%) were common between the liquid and tissue in the TSO500 panels. We observed a significant correlation across WES and TSO500-called variants (TSO500 tissue\/TSO500 cfDNA r<sup>2<\/sup>=0.81, WES\/TSO500 tissue r<sup>2<\/sup>=0.91 (47 variants), WES\/TSO500 cfDNA r<sup>2<\/sup>=0.84 (17 variants). <b> <\/b> In the TSO tissue and cfDNA datasets, 19\/20 most commonly mutated genes were the same, while <i>FAT1<\/i> was the most commonly mutated gene in both tissue and ctDNA samples.

Although only a surgical resection can offer the chance of a cure, the 5-year survival rate after a potentially curative resection have been reported to be a low as 10-30 %. Peritoneal recurrence is a major recurrence pattern after surgery for PC. Peritoneal lavage cytology (CY) is employed widely in the diagnosis and staging of PC to rule out patients with occult peritoneal metastasis. However, the prognostic significance of CY+ in potentially resectable PC is still controversial. We rise the question of whether CY+ status in PC has predictive value for survival and early peritoneal recurrence. We conducted this study to evaluate use of a new genetically modified telomerase-specific replication-selective adenovirus, expressing GFP (TelomeScan F35) in rapid detection of viable peritoneal tumor cell (v-PTC) dissemination of PC. This human clinical trial sought to determine if the presence of virally-detected, rare v-PTC predict peritoneal recurrence and patient outcome. This study was approved by the IRB in Osaka Police Hospital and Rinku General Medical Center. Patients with resectable cytologically or histologically proven ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were enrolled. 100ml of saline as peritoneal lavage fluid was harvested just after a laparotomy in 53 patients with PC. Half of the fluid was examined by cytology with papanicolau staining and MOC-31 immunostaining and the remaining half was analyzed to detect v-PTC with TelomeScan F35. To distinguish between leucocyte and cells with epithelial origin, cells were stained with anti-CD45 Ab. To further distinguish cells with primary tumor origin, cells were labeled with anti-CEA, anti-CA19-9 and EpCAM Abs. GFP-positive and CD45-negative, and either CEA-, CA19-9- or EpCAM-positive cells were counted as v-PTC by automatic detection system using NIS Elements imaging software. Patients were followed after surgery to evaluate its clinical significance. Among 53 patients aged 53-87 years (30 males and 23 females), 6 were cytologically positive (CY+), other 12 were virally positive by TelomeScan F35 (v-PTC+). All 53 patients underwent a surgical resection (PD\/DP\/TP=32\/14\/7). 2 patients were double positive (CY+\/v-PTC+), and peritoneal recurrence early occurred at 7 month after surgery despite adjuvant chemotherapy. 4 were CY+, but v-PTC-, and no peritoneal recurrence were observed (0%). On the other hand, other 10 were CY-, but v-PTC+, and 4 of these 10 patients occurred peritoneal recurrence (40%). Remaining 37 patients were double negative (CY-\/v-PTC-), peritoneal recurrence were observed in only 4 patients. In conclusion, the TelomeScan F35-based v-PTC detection may be an independent prognostic factor in patients with resectable PC and had close association with peritoneal recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e464d66-913c-4f15-9833-56028c380892\/@r03B8ZQE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Peritoneal metastasis,Liquid biopsies,Adenovirus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17561"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Masahiro Tanemura<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenta Furukawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manabu Mikamori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tadafumi Asaoka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuo Urata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kentaro Kishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daisaku Yamada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shogo Kobayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hidetoshi Eguchi<\/i><\/presenter>.

As DCIS is considered a non-obligate precursor of invasive ductal carcinoma most women with pure DCIS are treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) +\/- radiotherapy. However, for many this is likely to be overtreatment as only a minority will develop a subsequent ipsilateral recurrence. Studies also show that only ~60% of these ipsilateral recurrences are invasive disease with the remainder being pure DCIS. To predict which women are most likely to benefit from interventions, there is a need to identify biomarkers that are associated with invasive recurrence. Our aim was to assess whether copy number aberrations (CNAs) could be used to identify DCIS that was likely to recur as invasive disease or remain recurrence-free during long-time follow up.<br \/>We performed somatic copy number profiling on 309 pure DCIS samples that had not developed an ipsilateral event (controls), 198 that had developed subsequent ipsilateral invasive disease (INV-cases) and 58 that had developed subsequent ipsilateral pure DCIS (DCIS-cases). The samples were obtained from two large nation-wide cohorts: the Sloane cohort, a prospective breast screening cohort from the UK with a median follow up of 12.5 years and a Dutch population based cohort, with a median follow up of 13 years. CNAs were assessed using the CytoSNP array or low pass whole genome sequencing and analyzed using GISTIC.<br \/>Integrative cluster (IntClust) subtyping revealed that only 5 subtypes were well represented in DCIS compared to 10 in invasive disease and the distribution of clusters between INV-cases and controls was similar with the exception of IntClust 4, which was significantly more common in controls (P= 0.025, Fishers exact test). IntClust 4 is characterized to have low levels of genomic instability and a CNA-devoid. INV-cases were globally more aberrant than controls (P = 0.006, Wilcoxon test) as assessed by the chromosomal instability index (CIN) score. GISTIC identified 17 recurrent amplifications, 21 recurrent gains and 22 recurrent losses in the whole cohort. Six of these regions were more common in INV-cases compared to controls: amplifications at 17q24.1 and 8p11.23, losses at 1p36.13 and 11q23.2 &#8203;and gains at 17q21.33&#8203; and 16p (Nominal P &#60; 0.05 and FDR &#60; 0.1, Fishers exact test). Subgroup analysis of ER+, Her2- INV-cases versus controls revealed an additional differential CNA, amplification at 11q13.3 more common in cases.<br \/>DCIS-cases had similar CNAs to INV-cases and were more aberrant than controls in terms of CIN score (P &#60; 0.037, Wilcoxon test) but not as aberrant as INV-cases.<br \/>In conclusion, we have identified potential CNAs that are associated with invasive recurrence. Further analysis will integrate gene expression with copy number data to identify which genes are being targeted by these CNAs in order to identify pathways important in progression of DCIS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f236bc33-7130-4e12-bcba-7c170f0bc903\/@r03B8ZQE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DCIS,Biomarkers,Copy number alterations,Invasive breast cancer recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17562"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"a1e74878-23d4-46a8-89fa-43118ac79924","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a1e74878-23d4-46a8-89fa-43118ac79924\/@r03B8ZQE\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ahmed A.

We report the establishment of a protocol for CSF collection, cfDNA extraction and proof of concept study for the analysis of <i>H3K27<\/i> mutations as potential clinical biomarkers for CNS tumors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>CSF was collected from healthy donors (n=10) via lumbar puncture. cfDNA was isolated from approximately 2-3mL CSF from each donor using the Qiagen Circulating Nucleic Acid kit and quantified using the Qubit High Sensitivity DNA kit. Five normal donors were first tested for cfDNA recovery from CSF and then the remaining five were pooled and tested via a spike-in recovery experiment of <i>KRAS<\/i> G12D mutation ddPCR detection assay. Primer\/probes specific to wildtype <i>H3F3A\/HIST1H3B<\/i> and mutant to K27M were designed for ddPCR testing with cfDNA from the CSF of CNS tumor patients (n=10).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>cfDNA was successfully isolated from CSF of five healthy samples. The mean cfDNA concentration was 7.6ng DNA per mL CSF with a range of 3.89-11.27 ng\/mL CSF. The low yield of cfDNA further confirm the need for an extremely sensitive detection method for biomarkers in CSF. Synthetic DNA for the <i>KRAS<\/i> G12D mutation was spiked into a pool of healthy volunteer CSF at quantities as low as 1fg and then measured successfully downstream in ddPCR, illustrating the ability of this workflow to recover and measure very low levels the mutant DNA. The 1fg spike in amount yielded an average of 0.77copies\/uL. Multiple ddPCR assays were designed for the <i>HIST1H3B<\/i> assay but after several iterations, no successful assay could be established for this mutation: a result consistent with other reported findings. However, an assay to measure <i>H3F3A<\/i> p.K27M was identified and is currently being optimized.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Collectively, we demonstrated the use of CSF as a matrix for biomarker testing in a clinical setting. Using commercial kits, ctDNA can be extracted from CSF and used downstream in biomarker detection assays. On-going work includes expanding the tested cohort to CNS tumor samples using a developed ddPCR assay to detect the <i>H3F3A<\/i> p.K27M mutation. We anticipate the establishment of a reliable CSF cfDNA detection method to enable the study of CNS tumor for genomic evolution, minimal residual disease monitoring and the characterization of tumors at recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b8a5ea2a-e0e8-4ed8-8a89-a90e83dad068\/@r03B8ZQE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating cell-free DNA,Biomarkers,Droplet digital PCR,Cerebrospinal fluid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17564"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dennis J.

A novel multidimensional molecular tumor burden (MTB) model was utilized by integrating shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) of cfDNA and the levels of a set of plasma protein markers (PTMs) in a single blood draw. Copy number aberrations (CNAs) and fragment size (FS) patterns across the genome from sWGS data and levels of 7 PTMs (AFP, CEA, CA153, CA125, CA199, CYFRA21-1, CA724) are exploited to establish the MTB model.Newly diagnosed patients with lymphoma were radiologically assessed at baseline and periodically reassessed after treat started as determined per standard of care routine clinical assessment. The patients also had 10 ml venous blood samples collected for SeekInClarity at baseline and every two treatment cycles.<b><\/b>At baseline, 55(61.1%) of 90 patients were tested positive (MTB&#62;2) by SeekInClarity, implying the high sensitivity. In particular, genome-wide or focal CNA pattern was observed from 52 of 55 positive patients, and FS profile abnormality was witnessed from 31 of 55 positive patients, indicating both features are fundamental and ubiquitous surrogates of tumor burden. Specifically, 8q24.2 is the most frequently amplified region at the baseline, which contains an important oncogene MYC. Moreover, the common regions of deletion were 1p36, 4q21 and 6q21. All these regions are involved in genes related to cancer. Elevated level of PTMs was also reported from 32 patients. All patients received varied combination therapies with chemotherapies as the backbone, and compared with clinical imaging. Patients who underwent the second and the third SeekinClarity tests mostly showed significantly decreased MTB, indicating partial response was achieved under the current regimens. Moreover, two of the patients underwent the fourth SeekInClarity test. One achieved a sustained partial response, but another had higher MTB at the fourth test so resistance may be inferred. And all the results were consistent with the clinical imaging. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated SeekInClarity, a non-invasive, multidimensional multi-omics blood-based assay, can promptly evaluate the treatment response of patients with lymphoma. By implementing this assay, the dynamic change of molecular surrogates (CNA, FS and PTMs) can help physicians to make well-informed decisions on the upcoming therapeutic strategies for each patient in conjunction with imaging. This study is still ongoing, and more cases and more time points are included to demonstrate the clinical performance of the assay comparing to the current standard of care for clinical evaluation of treatment response for lymphoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6c7ebbec-5997-4b27-9200-7ed4fe1ed451\/@r03B8ZQE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,molecular tumor burden,treatment response evaluation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17565"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"792176a7-7321-441e-a07d-c7523fec3f2f","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/792176a7-7321-441e-a07d-c7523fec3f2f\/@r03B8ZQE\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xinhua Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiming Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yinyin Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dandan Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuaipeng Geng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fangyuan Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiyong Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingzhi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mao Mao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Plasma was isolated from 20mL peripheral blood samples collected from over 400 pre-operative sarcoma patients, and matched tumor samples from surgical resection were frozen and stored. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from plasma was quantified using qPCR, and the quality was assessed using capillary electrophoresis. A subset of these cases were selected for whole exome sequencing (WES). WES of bulk tumor and whole blood samples identified tumor-specific genetic alterations, which then serve as personalized biomarkers of tumor DNA in patient plasma. We previously showed that droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) can detect and quantify ctDNA, by targeting patient-specific variants. However, ddPCR is limited in that it can only investigate one tumor variant sequence at a time. The purpose of the present study is to investigate methods of targeting multiple tumor variants simultaneously, increasing the chances of detecting ctDNA in patient blood. To this end, four cases were selected for multiplex PCR (mPCR) followed by targeted amplicon sequencing. For each case, six to eight of the tumor variants identified by WES were selected as targets, and primers were designed to amplify these sequences concurrently by mPCR. The amplicons will then be sequenced to detect the tumor variants. Additionally, two of the four cases have plasma collected at two different time points. To assess the viability of this method as a way to monitor disease surveillance, these cfDNA samples will be compared to determine how the abundance and nature of ctDNA changes over time. To date, cfDNA has been extracted from over 100 cases, the majority of which were positive for cfDNA. For each of the cases whole exome sequenced, a variety of tumor-specific variations were identified. The variants chosen as targets were selected based on having the highest variant allele frequency (VAF), with priority being given to mutations that alter the protein coding sequence. Thus far, mPCR primers have been designed and optimized for four separate cases. Across all cases analyzed by amplicon sequencing, the variant sequences could be detected in the amplicons generated by mPCR of tumor DNA. Furthermore, amplicon sequencing was able to recapitulate the variant allele frequency observed in WES. This indicates that the mPCR successfully amplified the sequences of interest in the tumor DNA, and that the sequencing results are accurate. Furthermore, no tumor variants were detected in the amplicons generated from blood DNA, which is to be expected. The cfDNA amplicons for these cases will be sequenced in this manner to investigate the presence of ctDNA. If successful, the ability to detect ctDNA in plasma will be an important first step in developing a testing protocol for clinical use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ebba042-9724-4bfd-ab85-71a86a9c7b05\/@r03B8ZQE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Droplet digital PCR,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17566"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paige Darville-O'Quinn<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nalan Gokgoz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim M.

By performing pathway analysis on GAP scores, we identified 108 significant pathways enriched in the never-smoker group (FDR &#60; 5%), 18 of which were associated with immune cell signatures, specifically myeloid cells and macrophages. Based on our previous association of IL1RN GAP scores with disease progression in NSCLC, we examined whether these results are confirmed. In this cohort, patients with high IL1RN GAP scores were significantly associated with worse lymph-node staging (N) (P = 6E-3), which is indicative of worse prognosis.

In early-stage NSCLC, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection is especially challenging, requiring highly sensitive and specific assays. Therefore, we used a WGS approach (MRDetect) for ultra-sensitive ctDNA detection in NSCLC patients (pts) undergoing curative surgery.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the MRDetect approach in serial plasma samples (including pre-surgery, post-surgery and follow-up [f\/u] timepoints) from resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC pts. Pts underwent routine surveillance by computed tomography scans. ctDNA was extracted from ~1mL plasma. MRDetect uses WGS by a tumor-informed approach (sequencing coverage 40x for tumor, 20x for plasma DNA) combined with AI-based error suppression models (trained and calibrated with a non-cancer cohort, n=17) to increase the signal to noise ratio for precise ctDNA detection, and improve the accuracy of readouts especially for low tumor burden scenarios. The assay reports the detection and quantification of ctDNA burden in blood with a prognostic value for risk of recurrence. The ability of the assay to predict recurrence from a single sample, taken at the clinical landmark point (median 1.6 mths post-surgery, range 0.1-6.5) was evaluated.<br \/>Results: Overall, 52 NSCLC pts were enrolled (n=88 plasma samples) with median clinical f\/u of 32.6 mths (range 3.1-98.6). There were 43 pts with post-surgery landmark samples, with median age 62 years, 70% were male, 79% were adenocarcinoma and 49% were EGFR mutated. 26% were stage IB and 37% each were stage II and III. There were 15\/18 (sensitivity 83%) pts with confirmed radiological recurrence in which MRDetect was positive, including 6\/7 (86%) EGFR mutated pts. The median RFS in MRDetect positive pts was 15.2 mths (range 3.7-33.4). Among 25 pts with no recurrence (median f\/u 25.6 mths), MRDetect reported 4 pts to be MRD positive (specificity 84%). These results were consistent between EGFR mutated (sensitivity 86%, specificity 86%) and wildtype pts (sensitivity 82%, specificity 82%). For longitudinal samples (n=17 pts), negative ctDNA was associated with absence of recurrence in 14\/15 pts (specificity 93%). At the AACR meeting, results from a planned larger validation study will be presented.<br \/>Conclusion: Using a robust WGS implemented AI-based computational platform (MRDetect), we demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity detection of MRD in both EGFR mutated and wildtype NSCLC. With an increasing number of therapeutic options in the adjuvant setting for NSCLC, an ultra-sensitive MRD assay has the potential to facilitate personalized clinical decision-making for tailoring both the need and choice of adjuvant therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8dc940f4-5059-4a75-bea2-69855d1d049a\/@r03B8ZQE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17568"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aaron C.

Identification of this high-risk population and treatment with ACT could potentially reduce their risk of recurrence. However, the relative contribution of the factors used to define high risk stage II disease needs better understanding, although post-surgical ctDNA has been studied as a marker for an elevated risk of recurrence in stage I-III colorectal cancer.<br \/>Methods: Individual data from 3 early colorectal cancer clinical studies(Tie, 2016;Reinert, 2019; Chen, 2021) that included information on high-risk factors and post-surgical ctDNA status were collected and reanalysed for 595 patients with or without ACT.<br \/>Results: In stage II CRC patients with ctDNA-negative not treated with ACT form the Tie cohort, with high-risk status (n=42) showed a significantly reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to those with low-risk status(n=122) [HR, 3.283; 95%CI, 1.398 to 14.18; P = 0.0116], but in the ctDNA-negative patients with high-risk status, ACT (n=32) or not did not affect the RFS(P=0.1758). It meant false negatives of ctDNA made for bias of survival analysis results. Interestingly, in other two cohorts of stage II CRC patients with ctDNA-negative not treated with ACT, high-risk status showed no difference in RFS compared to low-risk status (p=0.3429 and 0.3173, respectively). In addition to the low sample size, the contribution of defined high-risk factors in prognosis was worth exploring which meant pseudo high-risk status also affect survival analysis results. And there were big differences in the high-risk factors included in the three cohorts especially in ctDNA-negative patients, such as the proportion of lymph nodes (LN) yield &#60;12 seemed higher in Tie cohort.<br \/>Conclutions: It was not enough to predict recurrence depend on ctDNA status alone for stage II CRC. Different risk factors might have different prognostic weights so that different combinations of post-surgical ctDNA status and risk factors might be used to make more accurate ACT decision.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,stage II colorectal cancer,high-risk factor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17569"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xie Gui Yuan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liu Miao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huang Meng Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

Previously, we demonstrated that ELSA-seq, a machine-learning-aided methylation profiling test, can detect and locate multiple cancers with high accuracy in plasma samples. Here, we evaluated the analytical performance of a refined test version of ELSA-seq, including analytical sensitivity, specificity, repeatability\/reproducibility, and robustness.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> The classification algorithm and cut-offs for the ELSA-seq test were established in the THUNDER study (NCT04820868). Here, we describe the analytical performance using both plasma samples from the THUNDER study and DNA blends from cell lines. Analytical sensitivity was established by defining the limit of detection (LoD) using in-house cfDNA Methylation Reference Standards (MRS) with lowest DNA input for the assay. In brief, fragmented genomic control DNA (NA24385, Coriell Institute) was used as a diluent to contrive human cancer cell lines with defined mixing ratios (tumor fractions), which was further verified by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). The LoD was determined by the lowest tumor fractions at which accurate DOC and TOO was reported in at least 95% of replicates. As variant allele frequency (VAF) is widely used as a surrogate measurement for tumour fractions, we also used ultra-deep mutation sequencing to attain VAF as an independent piece of evidence. Analytical specificity was assessed by the true negative rate in 120 plasma samples from age-matched healthy donors. A batch-to-batch repeatability\/reproducibility study was carried out using 168 clinical samples processed across multiple reagent lots, instruments, and operators. Robustness was evaluated using common interfering substances that potentially could be present in plasma samples such as hemoglobin, bilirubin, triglycerides, and genomic DNA. Testing was performed using 24 cancer and 24 non-cancer samples, with or without interfering substances.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> At 5ng input mass (approximating from 1ml plasma), the LOD<sub>95<\/sub> was estimated down to 0.05% (tumor fractions) or 0.02% (VAF) among 6 cancer cell lines. 2 false positives were detected in 120 age-matched healthy donor samples, yielding a specificity of 98.3% (95%CI: 93.5-99.7%). All test results were concordant across multiple reagent lots, instruments, and operators (100% repeatability and reproducibility), and high Pearson correlation coefficients (&#62;99%) were observed in the pair-wise comparison. In addition, none of the substances tested interfered with the assay.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These results suggest that ELSA-seq is a highly sensitive test for detection of the trace amount of tumor-derived methylation signals in plasma samples. The performance is highly reproducible and robust, which is critical for clinical implementations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fe6ad308-4e18-487d-b153-1aa1ca03d963\/@s03B8ZQF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"cfDNA,Methylation,Early detection,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17570"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bingsi Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangliang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiayue Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianlong Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ya Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fujun Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuai Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaofang Wen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guoqiang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shangli Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhihong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provides a novel approach for detecting the existence of MRD and predicting clinical outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Most ctDNA MRD assays require tumor sequencing to identify tumor-derived mutations to facilitate ctDNA detection, requiring tumor and blood. Herein, we evaluated a plasma-only ctDNA assay integrating genomic signatures to enable tumor-uninformed MRD detection. <b>Methods:<\/b> 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent radical surgical resection were involved from July 2019 to October 2020. Blood samples were collected for next generation sequencing (NGS) within 7 days after surgery, and 10 of them had preoperatively matched plasma ctDNA results. NGS (381 genes panel) was performed on plasma samples to capture tumor somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs). Clinical information was obtained to evaluate the prognostic performance of ctDNA comparing with traditional clinical biomarkers. Plasma and peripheral blood cell samples were sequenced to a mean depth of 7396 and ctDNA results correlated with recurrence-free survival (RFS). <b>Results:<\/b> Characteristics of the 20 HCC patients were as follows: 85% age&#8805;50 years, 70% HBV positive, 75% largest tumor diameter&#8805;5cm, 55% liver cirrhosis, 85% AFP &#62; 400ng\/ml, 60% MVI, 55% PVTT, 50% BCLC C, 70% CNLC III. After a median follow-up of 13.60 months, 10 recurrence events were recorded. In order to evaluate the presence of MRD after radical surgery, at least one low frequency SNV detected was considered ctDNA-positive. Using stringent quality criteria 8\/20 (20%) were ctDNA positive after resection. The median RFS for ctDNA-positive patients was 6.98 months versus 27.57 months for ctDNA-negative patients (HR 3.727, 95% CI 0.9461-14.65; p=0.0247). Combining postoperative ctDNA SNV and preoperatively ctDNA CNV features could increase the sensitivity for predicting prognosis. To further confirm the effect of MRD on the RFS of HCC patients, multiple Cox regression was used to assess the effect of multiple factors, including MRD, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), HBV, Liver cirrhosis, macrovascular invasion, PVTT, Child-Pugh score and CNLC stage, on the RFS. The forest plot results showed that the postoperative ctDNA was an independent factor for predicting the RFS of patients with HCC (MRD: HR=14.02, p=0.018). <b>Conclusion: <\/b>These preliminary results suggest that ultra-deep sequencing of ctDNA analyses can detect somatic mutations to reflect postoperative MRD state and predict recurrence of HCC.

The gene variants information was summarized, analyzed and visualize using the maftools R package (Mayakonda et al. 2018.).<br \/>Results: In total, DNA alterations were detected in 93.86% (275\/293) plasma samples and 90.91% (170\/187) in tumor samples, which variant levels included pathogenic, likely pathogenic and variant of uncertain significance. The most commonly altered genes in ctDNA results were TP53 (52%), TERT (24%), LRP1B (22%), FAT1 (15%), CTNNB1 (14%). While in HCC tumor testing results were TP53 (55%), TERT (27%), CTNNB1 (17%), SPTA1 (14%) and ARID1A (12%). Both the most variant classification was missense, next were frameshift indel. Both the top five affected pathways were TP53, RTK-RAS, NOTCH, WNT and Cell Cycle. In WNT pathway related genes, the highest alteration frequency tumor oncogene was CTNNB1, and suppressor gene was APC. We analyzed mutually exclusive and co-occurring event on top 25 mutated genes. In ctDNA analysis results, the probability of co-mutation between LRP1B and KMT2A gene was the highest (p &#60; 0.001), while mutual exclusion between ARID1A and EGFR gene was the highest.<br \/>Conclusion: Circulating tumor DNA mutation detection in HCC is feasible in the absence of HCC tissue DNA. The analysis results revealed the genomic landscape characteristics of blood-derived ctDNA in HCC were consistent with tumor tissues, which can provided HCC potential prognosis and treatment related genes information to further study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a3b237b1-6e25-4bf4-91ff-4ac1c12de610\/@s03B8ZQF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Next generation sequencing,Hepatocellular carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17573"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dinghua Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheng Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baitang Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tingting Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

While microarray studies identified many genes differentially expressed between MBM and extracranial metastasis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the established technology to evaluate clinical MBM. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are &#8220;seeds&#8221; of fatal metastasis and smallest functional units of cancer. Defining mechanisms which regulate the spatial and temporal competence of patient-isolated CTCs driving MBM thus presents the opportunity to suppress its occurrence. Hypothesis is that MRI has fundamental translational relevance to validate preclinical CTC models and that MBM onset depends upon the absence or presence of human immune system cells (Hu-mice), and mice gender and age. We isolated CTCs from blood of primary\/metastatic melanoma patients, and confirmed CTC detection by CellSearch<sup>TM<\/sup>, Parsortix<sup>TM<\/sup>, high-definition microscopy and RNA-Seq profiling.<i> <\/i>Second, we injected melanoma CTCs in immunodeficient but also immunocompetent xenografts (NBSGW female\/male mice generated by multiple donors CD34+ cells), and assessed tumor progression by IVIS and MRI with parallel monitoring of CTC gene-specific transcriptional activation. Third, we discovered specific differences in number of CTCs\/CTC clustering patterns and CTC signatures which were dependent upon MBM status. Quantitation of melanoma CTC-derived signatures enabled serial noninvasive monitoring of tumor burden. Lastly, we found that these differences and the occurrence, severity and spatial distribution of MBM highly depended from gender, age, and immunocompetency status of injected animals. Thus, by reporting the first MRI CTC xenograft model, its use for melanoma CTC interrogation can provide a platform for early monitoring of response to immunotherapeutic and\/or targeted interventions in melanoma, and contribute to rational therapy applications, notably for MBM prediction or prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55218299-55b6-4b87-aabc-68f12887808e\/@s03B8ZQF\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Brain metastasis,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Magnetic resonance imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17574"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tetiana Bowley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dario Marchetti<\/i><\/presenter>.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with HNC have shown modest clinical response rates of ~20%. It is unclear how radiation may potentiate the impact of immunotherapies in combination strategies. Pre-clinical models have found that radiation-induced mutational burden and HLA expression may synergize with immunotherapies to improve response rates. Unfortunately, there are limited biomarkers available to evaluate phenotypic and gene expression changes induced by combination strategies. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have shown clinical value in numerous solid tumors, and have potential in HNC as a liquid biopsy to evaluate these treatment induced molecular alterations. In this report, we integrate CTC capture using EGFR as a target antigen for phenotype and gene expression analysis in mouse models and samples from patients with HNC.<br \/>The efficiency and specificity of microfluidic EGFR CTC capture was verified in vitro using serial dilutions of HNC cell lines: two expressing EGFR (SCC6 and MOC2-huEGFR) and one without (MOC2). Mouse models were used to confirm ex vivo EGFR capture by IV injection of calcein-stained MOC2-huEGFR cells, followed by blood draw &#60;1 minute post-injection. CTCs were then isolated and characterized from blood drawn from patients with HNC using the same microfluidic capture.<br \/>The median capture efficiencies for SCC6 and MOC2-huEGFR cells were 100% and 87%, respectively, over a range of 5-100 target cells (R2= 0.9999). No untransfected MOC2 cells were captured at the 100 cell dilution level. An average of 10 cells was captured from the blood of mice injected with 1x10^6 MOC2-huEGFR cells; detectable with both single-cell microscopy and RT-qPCR for EGFR mRNA expression. CTCs were successfully detected in blood samples from patients with HNC and identified with single-cell expression of PD-L1 and HLA I as potential biomarkers of response and resistance.<br \/>These results demonstrate the single-cell sensitivity for the evaluation of both protein and mRNA biomarkers on HNC CTCs. The high levels of accuracy and sensitivity achieved with the EGFR-based capture showcase the potential for HNC drug development using murine models of metastatic HNC. Successful detection of HNC CTCs has led to the integration of this assay in clinical trials for patients with this disease. Future directions include evaluation of additional CTC protein and mRNA biomarkers in murine models and samples from patients with HNC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ccb5511-50b6-49c9-ba3c-fd6d5efab35d\/@s03B8ZQF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor cells,Head and neck cancers,Radioimmunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17575"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matt C.

The known heterogeneity of RCC may explain the limited utility of biomarker testing on single-site biopsies. This has led to great interest in liquid biopsy as an accessible source of tumor cells to evaluate mechanisms of response and resistance. Given the growing use of immunotherapy (IO) in patients with RCC, and the promise of their companion diagnostics in other disease settings, we evaluated the ability of liquid biopsy quantification of PD-L1 to predict patient response to IO in the OMNIVORE clinical trial, NCT03203473. Patients on trial were given nivolumab monotherapy, followed by radiographic scans at C3D1, with follow-up scans confirming CR\/PR defined as &#8220;response.&#8221; Responding patients were placed on observation, while non-responders were transitioned to the dual therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab arm. PD-L1 and HLA I expression was quantified on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using Exclusion-Based Sample Preparation (ESP). Single-cell protein analysis of PD-L1 and HLA I on CTCs facilitated the generation of summary statistics including average expression of all CTCs, number of CTCs categorized as PD-L1 or HLA I positive, and frequency of CTCs with either positive or negative expression. ROC curves were used to compare diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of different CTC summary statistics for 30 patients with evaluable matched baseline and arm assignment data. Kaplan-Meier curve evaluation was performed on the summary statistic identified as that with the greatest clinical value. ROC curve analysis identified the metric &#8220;number of PD-L1+ CTCs&#8221; at arm assignment as having the greatest clinical value (AUC 0.8) compared to all other CTC summary statistics evaluated, with a diagnostic sensitivity\/specificity of 88\/60% at a cutoff of 2.5 PD-L1+ CTCs \/ 7.5 mL. Survival analysis showed that patients with fewer PD-L1+ CTCs had a longer durable response (68 weeks vs. 16 weeks, HR 2.9) to single agent nivolumab.<b> <\/b>These results suggest that the number of PD-L1+ CTCs is a potential biomarker of treatment response that may have utility for treatment stratification and investigation of novel combination strategies for patients with poor prognostic features. This biomarker is now being tested in multiple prospective clinical trials to further study clinical utility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/52f53c16-2222-42a1-a1b6-6c14e47efb4d\/@s03B8ZQF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Biomarkers,Renal cell carcinoma,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17576"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rory M.

Once established, metastatic nodules oftentimes exhibit distinct molecular phenotypes from their original primary tumor, undermining gold-standard methods for determining treatments for patients, which typically rely on molecular characterization of the primary tumor. Unfortunately, a lack of robust, scalable, and appropriate models for studying differences in patient-derived primary and metastatic tumors has hindered progress in identifying metastasis-specific therapies. Previously, we reported the ability to establish <i>in vitro<\/i> cultures of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), a unique precursor population of cells that exhibits an ability to escape the primary tumor but not yet fully complete metastasis. We have since expanded the application of this GU-CTC platform to culture CTCs from the blood of patients diagnosed with a variety of metastatic cancers, resulting in the successful culture of 31 unique patient-derived CTC cell lines. Furthermore, following an initial short-term culture period, we also performed subcutaneous injection of mixed CTC cultures into immunocompromised mice, resulting in not only primary tumor formation, but also systemic metastatic nodule formation in as short as 3 months. These resulting CTC-derived xenografts (CDXs) have been demonstrated using metastatic pancreatic, colorectal, and lung adenocarcinoma-derived CTCs. Encouragingly, all CDX models also exhibited replicable metastatic patterns upon reimplantation, reinforcing the important role of CTCs as precursors to metastasis. Bulk RNA-sequencing of patient-matched whole blood, cultured CTCs, and CDX-derived primary tumor and metastatic tissues further identified enrichment of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition as well as several cancer-specific gene signatures consistent with an invasive phenotype. This extended GU-CTC platform therefore enables not only the robust and rapid expansion of CTCs through both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> methods, but also offers an avenue for personalized drug screens in the effort to target cancer metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Circulating tumor cells,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17577"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jerry Xiao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Schlegel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seema Agarwal<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite the continuously mounting interest, isolation of these cells remains challenging due to the multitude of factors, including rarity of the CTCs in blood, their constant exposure to therapeutic agents, and the harsh environment in the circulation. To address this, we have developed a novel microfluidic biochip capable of CTC isolation from unprocessed whole blood. Herein, we compare isolation of CTCs from the central and peripheral blood samples of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients using our biochip to assess impact of blood collection location on CTC count and viability.<br \/>Methods: We included 19 patients with MBC, of which 26% are white, 63% are African American, and 11% are Latino. The median age of the cohort is 58 (34-75y). All patients are undergoing therapy. A total of 36 samples (7.5 mL each) were collected from either an antecubital vein (peripheral vein) or the subcutaneous port catheter (central vein) at different time points. All samples were processed within 5 hours of blood drawn in our novel microfluidic biochip (only 40 minutes per sample, without pretreatment), followed by <i>in situ<\/i> immunostaining. CK<sup>+<\/sup>\/EpCAM<sup>+<\/sup>, DAPI<sup>+<\/sup> and CD45<sup>-<\/sup> cells were counted as CTCs. <i>In situ<\/i> live\/dead assay using Calcein AM and propidium iodide was performed for some samples right after CTC isolation.<br \/>Results: CTCs were detected in all the samples (36\/36), with a median of 15 CTCs per sample. A &#62;5 CTCs count was found in 86% of the samples (31\/36). No correlation was found between CTC count and race\/ethnicity. The CTC count in central venous samples was in the range of 6-105 (median 27), while the range was 1-45 (median 10) in the peripheral samples. The difference was found to be statistically significant (p&#60;0.001 using ANOVA). While no correlation between CTC count and patient age was found for the overall samples, we noted a significantly higher CTC count in central venous blood of younger patients (&#60;60y) than of senior patients (p&#60;0.05). Live\/dead assay immediately following the microfluidic isolation found live CTCs in patient samples.<br \/>Conclusions: Viable CTCs were rapidly isolated and detected in MBC samples using our novel microfluidic biochip. Our results show that CTC count in blood drawn from central vein yields significantly higher numbers than from the peripheral vein, suggesting that central venous samples might be preferred for prognosis and monitoring to drug response in MBC patients. Viable CTCs may provide an opportunity to evaluate the mechanism of resistance to therapies. More studies with larger cohorts are needed to further confirm these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/afed95e6-36d5-4c7f-8014-b2f5dda74faf\/@s03B8ZQF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Circulating tumor cells,Microfluidics,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17578"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jian Zhou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiyue Luan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Celine Macaraniag<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arielle Guzman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Mantice<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oana Danciu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kent Hoskins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Papautsky<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have recently identified OCT4A translation in a human cancer cell subpopulation that might exacerbate cell migration and invasion. Here, we focus on biological and clinical features of OCT4A and its relationship with secreted phosphoprotein 1(SPP1), which is strongly related to the malignant progression of numerous tumors.<b><br \/>Methods:<\/b> RT-PCR or qPCR analysis was used to identify full-length spliced forms of OCT4A and SPP1 transcripts in non-tumor and tumor human cells. An OCT4A-FLAG-tagged genomic transgene identified OCT4A-positive cancer cells. Cell-ablation of OCT4A-positive cells using promoter-driven diphtheria toxin A was used to examine the potential role of OCT4A in lung and endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. OCT4A and SPP1 transcripts in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (stage I, fifty-eight cases) were analyzed and compared with pathohistological and prognostic features.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found that OCT4A and SPP1C are co-expressed in highly aggressive human lung and endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines but not in mesothelioma or non-tumor cell lines. Ablation of OCT4A-positive cells significantly decreased cancer-cell migration and SPP1C mRNA levels. The OCT4A\/SPP1C axis was found in primary, early-stage, lung adenocarcinomas, and all four cases of recurrence and\/or metastasis out of 58 cases were included in the OCT4A and SPP1C positive group.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Co-expression of OCT4A and SPP1C may correlate with human cancer cell migration and the OCT4A\/SPP1C axis may have a prognostic value in high-risk, early-stage lung adenocarcinomas.

A Trop2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, sacituzumab govitecan, has been approved by the FDA for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Trop-2 enhances Akt phosphorylation in numerous cancer cell lines, while the opposite findings are also reported suggesting the cell context-dependent effect of Trop-2.

Here, we introduce a circRNA-based classifier that could improve the prognostic stratification of LA-NPC patients. The circRNAs are identified by microarray profiling, followed by qRT-PCR validation and selection using a machine learning method in the training cohort (n = 170). Based on the proposed classifier, two prognostic-distinctive NPC subtypes are identified, namely the high-risk subtype (subtype H) and low-risk subtype (subtype L), which have significantly different disease-free survival (HR 2.99, 95% CI 1.58-5.67, P &#60; 0.001). Validation in the internal cohort (n = 170) and external cohort (n = 150) yield similar results and the circRNA-based classifier is an independent risk factor of posttreatment relapse. Meanwhile, multiple interdependent features of different subtypes are observed, including relatively higher immune cell infiltration and immune-related pathways activation in subtype L; and predominant stromal, immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting components with moderate immune activation in subtype H. With a less aggressive and more immune-active tumor microenvironment, patients of subtype L could benefit from the addition of induction chemotherapy. In contrast, patients of subtype H, who are vulnerable to chemoresistance, display a strong tendency to benefit from additional immunotherapy. Overall, we define two NPC prognostic subtypes based on a circRNA classifier across multiple cohorts, which exhibit distinct biological ecosystems and suggest opportunities for the personalization of therapeutic regimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e6862b9b-12fa-4be7-ae5b-fd59a2d05fa7\/@t03B8ZQG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer markers,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,circular RNA,Prognostic subtypes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17582"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yelin Liang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuheng Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingqin Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

Yet proper biomarkers for response\/resistance prediction remain unveiled.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older and had histologically confirmed gastric cancer (GC) or gastro-esophageal junction cancer (GEJ). The HER2 status was evaluated with tissue assay, including IHC and FISH. Paired plasma-white blood cell samples were collected prior treatment and assessed with targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Different therapeutic regimens and ctDNA biomarkers were explored in HER2-positive patients, who received combining therapeutics containing trastuzumab and anti-PD-1 agents. The HER2-positive status was defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+\/FISH-positive.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> A total of 49 patients were included. Four patients were excluded due to fail in the quality control for NGS. The HER2 status of tumor tissue and matched plasma ctDNA at baseline display a high concordance of 84.4% (38\/45). NGS ctDNA method demonstrated an 84.2% (33\/40) sensitivity and a 100% (5\/5) specificity to detect <i>HER2<\/i> amplification. Among HER2-positive patients, nineteen and eighteen patients were administrated trastuzumab+anti-PD-1&#177;anti-vascular (chemo-free) and trastuzumab+anti-PD-1+chemotherapy (chemo-containing) respectively. Compared to Chemo-free subgroup, the chemo-containing subgroup had numerically higher ORR (61.11% vs 31.58%, p = 0.10) and longer median PFS (8.98 vs 5.43 months, p = 0.54, HR 0.78, 95%CI: 0.35-1.73). Patients with <i>HER2<\/i> amplification in ctDNA had higher ORR than those without amplification (56.67% vs 0%, p = 0.009). Besides, an immune-related negative gene set (<i>PTEN<\/i> mutations, <i>MDM2<\/i> amplification and <i>FGF3\/4\/19<\/i> amplification) was also explored. The patients carrying immune-related negative gene alterations achieved decreased ORR (0% vs 54.8%, p = 0.02) and shorter PFS (2.1 vs 6.9 months, p&#60;0.0001, HR 8.21, 95%CI: 2.76-24.48), compared to that of wild type.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS: <\/b>The ctDNA display a high consistency with tumor tissue for HER2 status. Compared to chemo-free regimens, chemo-containing regimens trend to demonstrate improved PFS and ORR in HER2-postive GC\/GEJ, though no statistically significant. The <i>HER2<\/i> amplification and immune-related negative gene alterations in ctDNA might be used as alternative biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of combining therapeutics containing trastuzumab and anti-PD-1 agents. Further studies are warranted to confirm our observation for better management of HER2-positive GC\/GEJ.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a86b99c8-2a30-4ad6-bb52-10891d89b437\/@t03B8ZQG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,HER2,PD-1,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17583"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaoyi Chong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengqing Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Cong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fangli Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chenhui Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanyan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Congcong Ji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiqing Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaochen Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaotian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Most UBC arise from the urothelial lining. UBC frequently recurs and is the most expensive cancer to treat due to the need for constant patient monitoring. New prognostic markers are needed to assist patient management. This study aims to determine if Cathepsin L is an independent prognostic factor after controlling for UBC Stage and Grade. We studied the interrelationship of Cathepsin L with Ki67, a prognostic marker in UBC. A clearer understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying UBC development and progression will lead to improved methods of UBC prognosis and suggest new therapies. Cathepsin L is a ubiquitously expressed cysteine endopeptidase capable of degrading enzymes, receptors, and transcription factors, and of activating enzymes, receptors, biologically active peptides, and pro-hormone processing by limited proteolysis. Subcellularly located in the endosomal lysosomal compartment, Cathepsin L is catalytically active at pH 3.0 - 6.5. This is a retrospective study of archived tissues and existing deidentified medical records and tumor registry information. Archived FFPE tissues were donated to Wood Hudson Cancer Research Laboratory by St. Elizabeth Healthcare (SEHC). The study was approved by the SEHC IRB. Tumors were from 41 women and 92 men. UBC were classified according to subtype, depth of invasion and grade by a Board Certified pathologist (LED). 36\/62 (58.1%) of Stage 0 non-invasive UBC were Grade 1 or 2, and 26\/62 (41.9%) were Grade 3 or 4. Similarly 39\/90 papillary tumors (43.3%) were Grade 1 or 2 and 51\/90 (36.7%) were Grade 3 or 4. In contrast 68\/71 invasive UBC (Stages II, III and IV) were Grade 3 or 4. 39\/90 papillary tumors were Grade 1 or 2. All non-papillary tumors were Grade 3 or 4. Ki 67 (clone MIB-1, Dako) and Cathepsin L (Abcam) expression were detected immunohistochemically. Cathepsin L was highly expressed in normal urothelium (p &#60; 0.0001). In Stage 0, Cathepsin L expression in Grade 1,2,3 UBC was similar compared to expression in normal urothelium (p = 0.9070, 0.2560 and 0.0722). In Stage 0, Cathepsin L expression in Grade 4 UBC was significantly reduced compared to normal urothelium (p = 0.0011). Cathepsin L expression was significantly reduced in Grade 3 and 4 papillary tumors vs Grade 1 and 2 papillary tumors (p = 0.0002) and in Grade 3 and 4 non-papillary tumors vs Grade 3 and 4 papillary tumors (p = 0.0133). In each UBC subtype, grade or stage, when Cathepsin L expression was reduced cell proliferation as measured by Ki67 expression was increased and overall, this was significant (p &#60; 0.0001). Significantly reduced Cathepsin L expression was associated with tumor recurrence and death from UBC (p = 0.03, p &#60; 0.0001). These data suggest that when Cathepsin L is lost, intracellular levels of growth factor receptors such as EGFR may increase driving cell proliferation and UBC progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d93d5fd9-2a00-4190-b4b5-319c5fd09d77\/@t03B8ZQG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Lysosome,Prognostic markers,Proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17584"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"1b0557f8-e99d-4389-9dfb-f2ab5fe219c9","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b0557f8-e99d-4389-9dfb-f2ab5fe219c9\/@t03B8ZQG\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia H.

A convolutional neural network using H&#38;E image patches as inputs was developed to predict the cell type scores for each corresponding spot. For the external validation, the model estimated the cell type scores from H&#38;E-stained tissue image patches of lung adenocarcinoma of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-LUAD).

While it has been suggested that human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) homozygosity is associated with short survival among these patients, its association with toxicity has not been examined.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>We carried out high resolution HLA typing on 193 NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD1\/PDL1. Toxicity data was collected and graded as per common terminology criteria for adverse event (CTCAE) v5.0. We investigated the correlation between HLA-I\/II homozygosity, different supertypes and alleles with irAE. In addition, we investigated the relationship between irAE, clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We recorded 103 irAE among 179 (58%) patients suitable for analysis. Homozygosity at one or more HLA-I loci, but not HLA-II was associated with increased risk of irAE with relative risk RR=0.57 (95%CI 0.31-0.96, P=0.025). None of the patients with homozygosity at one or more HLA-I loci developed pneumonitis of any grade (P=0.037) or grade 3 toxicity (P=0.023). The presence of HLA-A03 (N=49) supertype or HLA-DRB1*0401 (N=22) genotype was correlated with increased risk of developing irAE, (RR=1.40, 95%CI 0.99-2.01, P=0.039) and (RR=1.51, 95%CI 1.05-2.06, P=0.023) respectively. In contrast, none of the patients with HLA-DQB1*0301 (N=5) experienced gastrointestinal toxicity (P=0.048) and HLA-DRB1*15:01 (N=16) seems to be protective against developing arthralgia (RR=0.19, 95%CI 0.03-1.0<b>, <\/b>P=0.041). The occurrence of any irAE was associated with improved ORR, PFS and OS (RR=1.94, 95%CI 1.57-2.47, P less than 0.0001), (HR=0.37, 95%CI 0.25-0.54, P less than 0.0001) and (HR=0.26, 95%CI 0.16-0.41, P less than 0.0001) respectively. The usage of steroid to treat irAE did not diminish the positive clinical outcome.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Homozygosity at one or more HLA-I loci can be a useful biomarker to predict irAE among NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD1\/PD-L1 in the first- or second-line setting.

In CRC, the lung is the most common extra-abdominal site of metastasis. Understanding the genetic characteristics and clonal evolution of primary tumor and lung metastases (LM) will help oncologists better outline treatments. To date, few studies for CRC with LM exist. As such, revealing the genetic characteristics and clonal evolution of resectable CRC with LM was the goal of this study.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> From January 2012 to July 2019, clinical data and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples were collected from 33 Chinese CRC patients. Nineteen (19) primary tumors and 10 matched LM samples were examined using a 450 cancer gene next-generation sequencing assay. Genomic alterations, including single base substitutions, indels, copy number variations (CNVs), and gene fusion and rearrangement, were assessed. A phylogenetic reconstruction of sequencing data using LICHeE was also performed for each patient.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Median patient age was 60 years old (48-67 years), with most having right lung metastasis. A significant difference existed between single (21\/33, 63.6%) and multiple LM (12\/33, 36.4%) (P &#60; 0.01). Median disease-free survival was 20 months (95% CI, 0-84), from primary CRC to LM. The most frequently mutated genes were <i>TP53 <\/i>(90%), <i>APC<\/i> (90%), <i>KRAS<\/i> (53%),<i> MUC16<\/i> (26%), <i>ARID1A<\/i> (21%). A comparison of mutational profiles for primary and matched LM samples revealed that 65.70% of alterations were consistent and that the most frequently mutated genes, including <i>APC<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, and <i>KRAS<\/i>, of the primary tumor were completely consistent with LM. However, some differences between metastatic and primary samples were determined. More CNVs were found in primary samples (11.4% vs. 4.6%), indicating that CNVs are early molecular events for tumorigenesis and disease progression. <i>SMAD4<\/i> was only present in two primary samples, while <i>LRP1B<\/i> was only present in two LM samples. Clonal evolution for eight patients indicated that phylogenetic structure was similar across patients. All patients had at least seven mutations on trunks. In trunks, <i>TP53 <\/i>(87.5%), <i>APC <\/i>(87.5%), <i>KRAS<\/i> (50%), and <i>LRP2<\/i> (37.5%) were frequently identified. A new actionable gene (<i>BRCA2<\/i>) emerged in LM sample was identified in one patient. The mean value of TMB for the primary was almost the same as that for the LM site (5.3 vs. 5 muts\/Mb, P &#62; 0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> Our data indicated that the genetic characteristics and clonal evolution of LM are highly consistent with those of the primary tumor, suggesting that suitable treatments can be selected based on the genetic characteristics of primary tumor in CRC patients with LM that cannot be surgically treated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f7cc8d2b-efca-4e4d-bfd9-acc8580da8a6\/@t03B8ZQG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,clonal evolution,genetic characteristics,lung metastases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17587"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yong Cheng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming-Jian Ge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan-Yu Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin-Peng Shu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin-Dou Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun-Wei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao-Fang Qi<\/i><\/presenter>.

The use of biomarkers for targeted therapy in metastatic CRC is well-established, requiring genetic testing of primary or metastatic biopsies. Here we aimed to assess the concordance of actionable alterations in matched primary and metastatic colorectal tumors.<br \/>Methods: Hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed in a CAP\/CLIA-approved laboratory (3DMed). NGS testing for SNV, InDel, CNV, MSI and TMB were performed on 19 primary tumors and 23 matched metastatic biopsies.<br \/>Results: 42 matched primary and metastatic tumor samples from 19 CRC patients were analyzed. 68.4% of the patients had only liver metastases, 5.3% ovarian metastases, 5.3% peritoneal metastases and 10.5% of the patients had more than one metastatic site. Mutational landscape showed that the primary samples and the metastases shared 80% of top 20 mutations. Biomarker concordance for KRAS was 89.5% (17\/19), NRAS was 89.5% (17\/19), BRAF was 94.7% (18\/19), EGFR was 89.5% (17\/19), BRCA2 was 94.7% (18\/19) and MS status was 100% (19\/19). Inconsistent RAS\/BRAF status was found in two liver metastases and one ovarian metastasis. The frequencies of SRC amplification (P = 0.08) and ACVR2A mutation (P = 0.31) seem to be higher in the primary tumors, although these were not statistically significant. Conversely, mutations of NRAS, EGFR and MAP2K4 were detected only in the metastases. One patient harbored EGFR amplification in the ovarian metastasis, while this variant was not present in liver and primary sites. Copy number loss of MAP2K4 was found in the metastatic biopsies of two patients. Tumor mutation burden was comparable between the primary tumors and metastases (3.12 vs 2.17muts\/Mb, P=0.29).<br \/>Conclusions: Our results demonstrates high concordance across multiple biomarkers between the primary and paired metastatic colorectal tumors. Molecular features of ovarian metastasis is more prone to inconsistent with primary sites than liver metastasis, which remains to be further verified in a large population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ff45bcdf-254a-44fa-95ce-6c12c7da2efb\/@u03B8ZQH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Biomarkers,Metastasis,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17588"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yun Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Xin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianning Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chao Jing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baoyi Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Depei Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Deng<\/i><\/presenter>.

In our previous study, we reported that human xenograft tumors sensitive to lenvatinib showed higher microvessel density (&#8220;MVD (IHC)&#8221;) than relatively resistant tumors in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Although MVD (IHC) is a potential indicator to predict antitumor activity of lenvatinib, available IHC data are limited. Here, we investigated a novel gene expression signature (MVD gene score) calculated from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data that reflects MVD (IHC) and antitumor effect of lenvatinib.<br \/>Tumor tissues were collected from 12 mouse syngeneic tumor models followed by RNA-seq. We also stained CD31 in the same tumors and calculated MVD (IHC) score by dividing the number of CD31 positive blood vessels by tumor area. Genes that met the following criteria were selected for MVD gene score calculation: (1) genes that are specifically expressed on endothelial cell cluster in in-house single cell RNA-seq data using Hepa 1-6 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma tumor tissues; (2) well-known angiogenesis markers from literature or genes whose expression show significant correlation with MVD (IHC) in mouse syngeneic tumor models. MVD gene score was calculated as the average of logarithm transformed gene expression values. In order to examine applicability of MVD gene score, we compared MVD (IHC) and MVD gene score to lenvatinib antitumor activities on mouse syngeneic tumors.<br \/>We measured MVD (IHC) and computed MVD gene score from RNA-seq data using matched tumor tissues of 12 mouse syngeneic models. MVD gene score was correlated with MVD (IHC). As reported, lenvatinib sensitive tumor models showed higher MVD (IHC) score. They also showed higher MVD gene score calculated from RNA-seq data.<br \/>Our newly developed MVD gene score has a potential to predict the antitumor activity of angiogenic inhibitors such as lenvatinib using RNA-seq data in tumor samples. Further validation study is ongoing using various human tumor samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f8aa7105-64bf-4373-a8eb-cc743b53bab6\/@u03B8ZQH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lenvatinib,Tumor microenvironment,Angiogenesis,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18487"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Megumi Kuronishi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoichi Ozawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takayuki Kimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Kato<\/i><\/presenter>.

Their tumor cell-specific expression makes them a key target of natural T cell response, cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and cell-based immunotherapies in a wide range of tumor types. In this study, we assess the pan-cancer distribution and ICB survival association of CTA burden (CTAB) in real-world solid tumors.<br \/><b>Procedure:<\/b> Three tumor sample cohorts were studied: 1) a pan-cancer discovery cohort to develop a low- and high-CTAB cutoff (n=5450, 39 tumor types), 2) a TCGA cohort (n=19923, 32 tumor types) used to validate the classifier based on CTAB distribution and serve as a non-ICB-treated population, and 3) an ICB-treated retrospective cohort to validate the classification on overall survival (OS) (n=242, 3 tumor types). The expression levels of 17 CTA were measured using targeted RNA-Seq of FFPE tumor samples and then ranked against a pan-cancer reference population. CTAB was calculated for each sample, cohort and tumor type as the sum of the 17 CTA gene expression ranks. The discovery cohort median CTAB of 171 was used to classify all three cohorts into high- and low-CTAB groups. OS analysis was performed on the TCGA and ICB-treated cohorts using a CoxPH regression model to determine the Hazard Ratio (HR).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The three cohorts demonstrated overlapping single-peak, left-skewed CTAB distribution curves centered at CTAB values between 170 (discovery cohort) and 256 (retrospective cohort). When grouping by tumor types and ordering by median CTAB, the CTAB distributions for tumor types within all three cohorts were comparable. CoxPH regression analysis revealed an association between the CTAB threshold classifier and OS in both the ICB-treated retrospective and non-ICB TCGA cohorts. However, the direction of this association differed between the two cohorts, with high-CTAB samples having better survival (HR=0.936, p=0.076) in the ICB-treated retrospective cohort and worse survival (HR: 1.007, p=0.084) in the non-ICB-treated cohort.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our studies show that the CTAB distribution was maintained across the discovery and TCGA cohorts and a wide range of tumor types, supporting that the CTAB classifier is valid and histology agnostic. Additionally, when evaluating the ICB and non-ICB-treated cohorts, CTAB demonstrated the ability to predict OS, pointing to the utility of ICB in supporting CTA-specific natural immune response. However, further studies are necessary to verify these mechanisms of response to ICB as well as cancer vaccines and cell-based immunotherapies. Additional validation is needed to establish the predictive utility of CTAB alone and in combination with other immune oncology biomarkers for resistance or response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41f88b66-8732-4306-9e07-9582fbea8c3d\/@u03B8ZQH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Cancer Testis Antigen,Immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18488"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>R.J.

This study investigated the impact of plasma HGF levels on EGFR inhibition and the therapeutic implications of MET inhibition in <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>NRAS<\/i>, and <i>BRAF<\/i> (<i>RAS<\/i>\/<i>RAF<\/i>) wild-type colorectal cancer (CRC).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Clinical outcomes were analyzed according to the plasma HGF levels in patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) receiving palliative first-line cetuximab or bevacizumab + FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Then, <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments were conducted to validate the clinical findings and to establish pre-clinical evidence of MET inhibition in the HGF-high population.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> From March 2015 to September 2019, a total of 80 patients were enrolled. The median age was 63 (range, 24-85) years. Of these, 45 patients (56.2%) were treated with bevacizumab + FOLFIRI and 35 patients (43.8%) were treated with cetuximab + FOLFIRI. Among patients with evaluable disease (43 patients (95.6%) in the bevacizumab group and 34 patients (97.1%) in the cetuximab group), the objective response rate was 60.0% and 37.8%, respectively (<i>p<\/i>=0.162). The median serum HGF level was 374.75 (range, 9.43-30,644.44) pg\/mL, and the optimal cut-off value of HGF levels was 12.70 pg\/mL by the maximal chi-square method. During a median follow-up of 29.3 (range, 1.2-71.3) months, both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly shorter in the high HGF group compared with the low HGF group: median 11.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.5-13.1) months vs. 24.7 (95% CI, 23.4-25.9) months for PFS (<i>p<\/i>=0.009), and median 21.1 (95% CI, 17.9-24.3) months vs. not reached for OS (<i>p<\/i>=0.018). The difference in PFS and OS was statistically significant in the cetuximab group (<i>p<\/i>=0.003 for PFS and <i>p<\/i>=0.035 for OS), but not in the bevacizumab group. In five <i>RAS<\/i>\/<i>RAF<\/i> wild-type CRC cell lines (Caco-2, COLO 320DM, KM12C, SNU-C1, and SNU-C4), the addition of HGF activated ERK1\/2 and AKT via MET phosphorylation. In the cytotoxicity assays, Caco-2 and SNU-C4 were relatively sensitive to cetuximab compared with the others and, in the presence of HGF, cetuximab sensitivity was significantly decreased in the two cells. Moreover, capmatinib, a MET inhibitor, abrogated the effect of HGF on common downstream signaling pathways of EGFR and MET and thus the cetuximab resistance was significantly overcome <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Among patients with mCRC receiving cetuximab + FOLFIRI, those with high plasma HGF levels had significantly worse PFS and OS. HGF induced cetuximab resistance by AKT and ERK activation while capmatinib, a MET inhibitor, significantly increased the anti-tumor effects of cetuximab in the presence of HGF <i>in vitro<\/i>.

This study aims to develop a minimally-invasive approach for the direct quantification of <i>AR-V7<\/i> in blood and evaluates whether <i>AR-V7<\/i> can act as a predictor of progression in CRPC patients undergoing hormonal therapy.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> A prostate cancer cell line (VCaP) was used to test the assay&#8217;s limit of detection. The detection of <i>AR-V7<\/i> was then evaluated in 126 serial plasma samples and 77 serial platelet samples, prospectively collected from 30 patients with CRPC before and during hormonal therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide) using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RT-qPCR and ddPCR were first performed on VCaP to measure a range of 20 fg to 20 ng VCaP cDNA. ddPCR was able to detect down to 2 pg while RT-qPCR was only able to detect 200 pg for AR-V7 and total AR. RT-qPCR and ddPCR were then performed on the plasma samples of CRPC patients. Our results observed that RT-qPCR was unable to detect <i>AR-V7<\/i> from these plasma samples, whereas ddPCR yielded a higher detection rate of 13%. Plasma with 22Rv1 and VCaP RNA spike-in revealed that RNase in plasma degraded spike-in RNA. We further detected <i>AR-V7<\/i> in platelet samples, our results found that RT-qPCR was able to detect <i>AR-V7<\/i> from 56% of the platelet samples and ddPCR yielded a much higher detection rate of 97%. Finally, we quantified the <i>AR-V7<\/i> levels of 22 available platelet samples taken at the point closest to the patients&#8217; progression time to evaluate the correlation of <i>AR-V7<\/i> with the patient&#8217;s progression records. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve was 0.656.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our results showed that platelet samples had higher detection sensitivity than plasma samples, this might be due to the possibility of RNA degradation by RNase during processing in plasma samples. Performing RT-qPCR and ddPCR on platelet samples, a higher detection rate was observed in ddPCR when compared with RT-qPCR. We successfully develop a detection test to assess <i>AR-V7<\/i> by highly sensitive ddPCR in the platelet of CRPC patients, with a high detection rate of 97%. We also reveal that there is a certain correlation between the ddPCR detection for <i>AR-V7<\/i> in patients&#8217; platelet samples with the patients&#8217; progression status, indicating that <i>AR-V7<\/i> may act as a potential predictor of progression in CRPC patients undergoing hormonal therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5eaa7549-58a7-4967-bfaa-1b64556d9dce\/@u03B8ZQH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,AR-V7,Castration-resistant prostate cancer,Digital PCR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18490"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William C.

Because not all patients respond to therapeutic treatments, it is urgently needed to more precisely identify the patients who fail to achieve complete response and only have a partial response or no response to treatments. No biomarker(s) or assay(s) are currently available to predict the treatment response in HCC patients.<br \/><b>Aim<\/b>:<b> <\/b>To evaluate serological biomarkers in BCLC Stage B &#38; C HCC patients undergoing treatment(s) including trans-arterial doxorubicin-eluting beads (DEB), trans-arterial radioembolization (Y-90 beads), and targeted molecular therapy (sorafenib).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Fifty newly diagnosed primary HCC patients without any treatment were recruited between January 2014 and December 2018. Patients received, DEB, Y-90 beads, and Nexavar throughout their treatment course. The serum samples were collated before treatment (Pre-tx) and post treatment (Post-tx) at month 3, month 6 and month 9. A U-PLEX assay (Meso Scale Diagnostics) was performed to detect multiple serological biomarkers in serum, including growth factors (FGF19, HGF, insulin and FGF21) and inflammatory cytokines (IFN-&#947;, IL-17, IL-6, and TNF-&#945;). The U-PLEX data were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All patients were followed 3-5 years for survival with or without further surgical operations including tumor resection\/ablation and orthotopic liver transplantation.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Based on the treatment outcome, patients were divided into 3 groups: <b><u>a.<\/u><\/b> overall survival (OS) &#60; 1 year was defined as poor response; <b><u>b.<\/u> <\/b>progression-free survival 3-5 years was defined as moderate response; and <b><u>c.<\/u><\/b> OS &#62; 5 years was defined as good response.

The serum levels of IFN-&#947; also showed an increasing trend, with significant increases at Post-tx-month 9 (p &#60; 0.05 vs Pre-tx). In the patients with poor response, the serum levels of HGF and IL-6 were increased Post-tx, with statistically significance at Post-tx-month 6 (p &#60; 0.05 vs Pre-tx).

While gene sequencing can predict effective treatment options in some cases, studies have estimated that only 10-15% of cancer patients are treated with genotype matched drugs. Additional treatment selection tools for predicting patient response thus remains a critical clinical need.<br \/>While gene sequencing has clear utility in predicting therapeutic response, gene expression is less commonly used in clinical tests to guide treatment selection. Gene expression is theoretically attractive to predicting therapeutic response because, unlike mutational analysis, it provides a direct readout of the dysregulated biochemical activities in the cells which may be targeted by particular therapies. One of the major problems with conventional approaches to using gene expression to predict therapeutic response is tumor heterogeneity; that is, a biopsied tumor contains multiple cells types and even different tumor clones that can confound a conventional bulk gene expression analysis. More recently, single-cell RNA expression analysis technologies have grown in popularity. These technologies enable the fine characterization of tumors and their cellular makeup and hold the promise of increasing the power of gene expression measurements for identifying therapy response prediction tools.<br \/>Here we show the application of single cell gene expression analysis with Proteona&#8217;s MapResponse&#8482; machine-learning algorithms to developing a predictive classifier for patient response to Daratumumab treatment in multiple myeloma. Starting with publicly available data (Cohen et al. Nat. Medicine 2021), we developed a classifier that accurately predicted the response of 94% of subjects in the published study. This classifier was able to accurately predict response in an independent cohort of Daratumumab-treated patients. In contrast, the classifier performed poorly in a cohort of patients who did not receive Daratumumab. Together these data suggest the classifier has specificity to predicting response to Daratumumab and is not a general prognostic signature. These early findings point to the potential value of combining single-cell RNA sequencing with machine-learning methods such as MapResponse&#8482; to bring precision medicine to more patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9dd22f62-2b30-42b2-b593-2d17edb0ccd2\/@u03B8ZQH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Machine learning,Single cell,Multiple myeloma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18492"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"ad9fcdc9-8507-4a6e-bf33-1693bd4697e9","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad9fcdc9-8507-4a6e-bf33-1693bd4697e9\/@u03B8ZQH\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jonathan Scolnick<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stacy Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjay De Mel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cinnie Yentia Soekojo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wee Joo Chng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Baseline clinical and genomic correlates associated with inferior outcomes on intensified therapy would help identify pts at high risk for early progression or death, may improve patient counselling and guide drug development.<br \/>Methods: In this IRB-approved study, pt-level data were collected retrospectively. Eligibility: mCSPC pts undergoing ADT plus NHT or docetaxel with available pre-treatment tumor comprehensive genomic profiling from a CLIA-certified lab. Study endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS) per PCWG-2, is defined as PSA, or radiographic, or clinical progression or death whichever occurred first. Variants of unknown significance and mutated genes present in &#8804;5% pts were excluded. Cox proportional hazards was used to evaluate the relationship between PFS and age at diagnosis, Gleason score, volume of disease (per CHAARTED), presence of visceral mets, PSA at baseline and genomic alterations. Significance was pre-set at p &#8804; 0.05.<br \/>Results: 106 pts with mCSPC were included: median follow-up was 20 months. Median age at diagnosis was 62 yrs (58 - 68); 85 pts (80%) had a Gleason score &#8805;8; 67 pts (63%) had de-novo metastatic disease; 69 pts (56%) had high-volume disease; and 20 (19%) had visceral metastases at time of diagnosis of metastatic disease. Most frequently mutated genes: <i>TP53<\/i> (28%, n=30), <i>TMPRSS2<\/i> (27%, n=29), and <i>PTEN<\/i> (21%, n=22). See table for COX regression results.<br \/>Conclusion: In this real-world cohort of mCSPC pts undergoing intensified ADT we identify clinical and genomic markers that are significantly associated with a an inferior PFS.

Survival in developed countries is &#62;80%, while in Colombia is &#8804;60%. These differences have been related to different factors, including genetic and epigenetic alterations, which could regulate chemoresistance mechanisms. Currently, some genetic alterations have been used to classify patients in a risk group, but a genetic profile that can be applicable to most patients to predict with high sensitivity the response to induction chemotherapy, improve the risk classification and predict survival is highly needed. We aim to identify gene profiles associated with response to induction chemotherapy in pediatric patients with ALL-B.<br \/>Methods: Bone marrow samples were collected from 27 patients with a new diagnosis of B-ALL. Blasts were separated and purified according to the expression of the CD19 and CD34. RNA was extracted and used as template for genomic libraries. RNA-seq was done using the Illumina platform, and the reads were aligned and quantified using Partek Flow. DEseq2 was used for statistical analysis and to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEG) between the patient groups. Response to induction treatment was defined (flow cytometry) as positive or negative minimal residual disease (MRD) as percentage of residual blasts &#62;0.01% or &#60;0.01%, respectively. Three comparison groups were defined: 1) true responders (MRD- at day 15 and MRD- at the end of induction) vs. true non-responders (MRD+ at day 15, and MRD + at the end of induction), 2) MRD- vs MRD+ at the 15 day of induction; 3) MRD- vs MRD+ at the end of induction. Genes with a p &#60;0.05 and a fold change &#62;2 were chosen. Additionally, an enrichment analysis was performed to determine the signaling pathways associated with treatment response.<br \/>Results: 159 DEGs were found among MRD- vs MRD+ at day 15 of the induction, 200 DEGs were identified between MRD- vs. MRD+ at the end of induction, and 153 DEGs were found between patients classified as true responders vs. true non-responders. Additionally, to determine the genes that could be predicting the response to treatment, a comparison was made between the DEGs of each group of patients analyzed, finding 50 genes in common. Interestingly, the genes identified are associated with differentiation of stem cells (<i>HOXB2<\/i>), metabolic process (<i>ST8SIA6<\/i>, <i>SPHK1<\/i>, <i>HPGD<\/i>), immune response (<i>CFH<\/i>, <i>PAR2<\/i>, <i>NFAM<\/i>), cell-cell signaling (<i>PEAR1<\/i>, <i>PTGIR<\/i>), and ion transmembrane transport (<i>SLC2A7<\/i>, <i>SLC45A3<\/i>). The overexpression of these genes is associated with a poor response to induction chemotherapy.<br \/>Conclusion: We identified 50 genes associated with the response to induction chemotherapy in pediatric patients with ALL-B. Those genes are associated with signaling pathways that could be explaining the lack of response in patients and might serve as possible biomarkers of response to induction treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/841a3a8e-fbcf-4489-be39-cf9b8cfea56e\/@v03B8ZQJ\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Gene expression profiling,Response,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18494"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yulieth X.

The incidence rate and mortality rate in Hispanic HCC is relative higher than other ethnic groups. Autoantibodies against tumor associated antigens (TAAs) have long been proved as useful biomarkers in cancer diagnosis. In the present study, sera from 25 Hispanic patients with HCC and 25 sera from normal individuals were used in a proteomic approach to identify HCC-related TAAs. Twenty-four immunoreactive protein spots (16 from HepG2 cells, and 8 from SUN449 cells) were excised from the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) gels, digested with trypsin, and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). Of 24 immunoreactive protein spots, 21 were identified with compatible molecular weights and isoelectric points. After further analysis, a total of 9 proteins were found to be potential TAAs, including endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP (HSPA5), 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI1), protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI), Actin-cytoplasmic 2 (ACTG1), calreticulin (CRP55), alpha-enolase (ENO1), heat shock 70 kDa protein (HSP70), tropomyosin alpha-3 chain (TPM3). Among these proteins, HSPA5 was corresponded to 5 protein spots on the 2DE gels, while 4 proteins (HSPA5, HSP60, TPI1 and PDI) were found in both HepG2 and SNU449 cell lines. Enrichment analysis show that these proteins are mostly responsible for protein folding in endoplasmic reticulum as well as ubiquitin ligase binding function. In the subsequent study, autoantibodies against these proteins will be detected by immunoassay, and further evaluated as biomarkers in detection of Hispanic HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Hispanic,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18495"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yangcheng Ma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cuipeng Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaojun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianying Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

PDAC is expected to be the second leading cause of cancer death and has a dismal 5 year survival rate of 10%. There is an urgent unmet need to detect the disease at an early stage and stratify patients into more effective treatment regimens within clinically meaningful timeframes. To accomplish this, robust quality controlled OMIC molecular profiling platforms and analytic solutions need to be deployed into precision medicine protocols to discover actionable biomarkers. Project Survival&#174; is a multicenter (n=6), prospective biomarker study (NCT 02781012) of PDAC and relevant controls combining high-fidelity longitudinal phenotypic characterization, multi-omic profiling (proteomics, signaling lipidomics, structural lipidomics, and metabolomics), and agnostic Bayesian artificial intelligence network inference (bAIcis&#174;) to discover biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic utility. This study utilizes a systems medicine approach for translational biomarker discovery by performing analysis of matched subject sera, plasma, buffy coat, saliva, urine, and tumor\/adjacent normal tissues and integrating them with the respective full clinical annotation using the BERG Interrogative Biology&#174; platform. Multiple longitudinal time points were taken over the course of the six-year timeline enabling dynamic modeling. Utilizing the Project Survival&#174; molecular and clinical data, we have analyzed and integrated baseline samples from 121 at risk patients and 279 patients with PDAC. Samples were randomized and analyzed over the course of recruitment allowing for agnostic discovery and integration to determine diagnostic utility. Discovery analysis identified 123 potential molecular markers, of which, four demonstrated a combined AUC of 0.85, PPV 0.83, NPV 0.72, and OR 13.1. In parallel, 4 non-canonical clinical measurements were assessed for diagnostic utility providing an AUC 0.79, PPV 0.84, NPV 0.72 and OR 13.2. Combining molecular and clinical features demonstrated an AUC of 0.9, PPV 0.9, NPV 0.77, OR 29.2, and p-value 1.4 E-40. Molecular markers revealed no treatment associated expression effects. Taken together, these marker panels demonstrate diagnostic utility to detect PDAC and will be further validated using robust bioanalysis methods as well as in an independent cohort of samples to provide enhanced insight into their positioning in the diagnostic landscape for PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/663b0104-1159-4f5f-bd45-9fa2f9591344\/@v03B8ZQJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Biomarkers,Diagnostic marker,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18496"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eric M.

Failure to detect early contributes highly to the poor survival rate of ovarian cancer. Thus, early detection of EOCs is likely to translate into mortality benefit. Two tests used clinically to detect ovarian cancer are serum cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) and transvaginal ultrasound. Both have limitations of specificity and sensitivity. CA-125 along with other biomarkers that are in clinical trials express both in the ovaries and serum of healthy females. Thus, the specific detection among cancer-free controls versus ovarian cancer cases remains highly variable. We hypothesize to assess the Doppel (<i>PRND<\/i> gene) as a serum biomarker in the detection of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC) at the early stages. Doppel, a prion-like protein first identified in 1996, is known to express in testis and appears to regulate male fertility. Previously, we and others reported that Doppel is a highly specific tumor endothelium marker. In this study, to validate the potential of Doppel as an EOC serum biomarker, using ELISA, we detected Doppel concentration in the sera of 76 sera samples from patients with stage and histopathology information, and in 18 normal human sera (NHS). Doppel level was significantly higher in sera of EOC patients than NHS (0.720 vs 6.653 ng\/ml, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001); 72 out of 76 patients were positive for Doppel expression (cut off value was calculated as Mean+3&#215;SEM = 1.296 ng\/mL) while only 3 out of 18 cases were positive for NHS. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that Doppel can differentiate EOC patients from normal individuals with AUC of 0.957, sensitivity of 90.8%, and specificity of 90%. Doppel was markedly higher in all stages of EOC than NHS (Stage&nbsp;I, 6.261 ng\/mL; Stage II, 8.045 ng\/ml; Stage&nbsp;III, 7.040 ng\/mL; and Stage IV, 5.726 ng\/ml vs NHS 0.720 ng\/ml; <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). Interestingly, serum Doppel level was higher among EOC of serous adenocarcinoma (7.020 ng\/mL; n = 39), mucinous (10.780 ng\/mL; n = 8), and endometroid (7.295 ng\/mL; n = 7) than clear cell (3.114 ng\/mL; n = 7) or other types (4.855 ng\/mL; n = 15). Together, our study showed the potential of Doppel as a serological biomarker for EOC detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Epithelial Ovarian Cancer,Doppel,Serum,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18498"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaojun Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bowon Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mazharul Karim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianying Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Yun Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>In-San Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taslim A.

Thus, the ultimate goals of our research are to learn how to detect ovarian cancer at its earliest stages of development and thereby improve patient survival and to learn how the immune microenvironment contributes to the development of OC. Achieving these goals requires us to better characterize the earliest steps in ovarian carcinogenesis. The human fallopian tube harbors the cell-of-origin for most high-grade serous 'ovarian' cancers (HGSOCs), but its cellular composition, particularly the immune component, is poorly characterized. Emerging evidence from several research groups using molecular sequencing technologies of fallopian tube epithelium strongly support this hypothesis. We recently described our use of single-cell transcriptome technology (scRNA-Seq) to profile the heterogeneity of non-malignant FT and define a novel transcriptional gene regulatory network of epithelial differentiation and tumorigenesis in the human FT. Here we present an in-depth characterization of the immune cell atlas for human fallopian tubes, which has not been reported. Our unpublished analyses of our FT dataset and the publicly available HGSOC scRNA-Seq dataset demonstrate a significant difference in the immune cell landscape. There are limited macrophages and a high abundance of monocytes in non-malignant FT and adjacent normal ovaries compared to those in HGSOC tumors. This finding leads us to hypothesize that the macrophage-to-monocyte ratio and their interactions with other immune cell types in human fallopian tubes create a permissive microenvironment allowing for the development of HGSOC and can provide a biomarker for early cancer detection. To test if those myeloid cells could be a marker for early HGSOC, we performed scRNA-seq on FT from women carrying mutant alleles of BRCA1 or BRCA2 who are at high risk of HGSOC. Intriguingly, the ratio of monocytes to macrophages in the FTs from half of these high-risk individuals is more like that found in HGSOC than in normal FT. Furthermore, computational analyses on myeloid cell types and their interactions with different epithelial cells, stromal fibroblast cells, and T and NK cells revealed the extended contribution of the non-epithelial microenvironment in FT, potentially driving early HGSOC development and progression. This cellular and molecular compendium of the human fallopian tube immune landscapes in cancer-free and cancer-high-risk women is expected to advance our understanding of the earliest stages of fallopian epithelial neoplasia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bf0a0a89-9d2a-4638-9719-38aeada43466\/@v03B8ZQJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Early detection,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18499"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Josh Brand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcela Harro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Forough Abbasi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xianzhi Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Siedhoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Andrew<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bobbie J.

In the United States, it remains higher incidence rates and worse survival in the Hispanic population than the other populations. Studies have demonstrated that autoantibodies to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) could be biomarkers with low-cost, efficient, and highly sensitive characteristics. In this study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to measure three autoantibodies to PAX5, PTCH1, and GNA11 in sera from 25 Hispanic Americans with HCC, 28 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), and 27 patients with chronic hepatitis (CH) as well as sera from 85 healthy individuals. At the 95% specificity for healthy controls, 56%, 48%, and 44% of HCC sera (or patients) showed elevated levels of autoantibodies to PAX5, PTCH1, and GNA11 respectively. Among the patients with LC, frequencies for autoantibodies to PAX5, PTCH1, and GNA11 were 44%, 36%, and 25% respectively. In patients with CH, the frequencies of autoantibodies to PAX5, PTCH1, and GNA11 were 22%, 22%, and 15%, which were significantly lower than those in HCC (p&#60;0.01). The area under the curves (AUCs) of autoantibodies to PAX5, PTCH1, and GNA11 for identifying HCC from healthy controls were 0.912, 0.915, and 0.915, respectively. The sensitivity could be improved to 68% when three of the autoantibodies were combined with the AUC of 0.932. Therefore, autoantibodies to PAX5, PTCH1, and GNA11 showed significantly higher levels in Hispanic HCC than those in the CH or healthy controls. Also, these three autoantibodies could enhance the detection of HCC if they were combined as the parallel test. In conclusion, autoantibodies to PAX5, PTCH1, and GNA11 could be potential biomarkers for the detection of HCC in Hispanic Americans. Large size of samples is needed to further determine their potential value in clinical application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Tumor antigen,Autoantibody,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18500"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Cuipeng Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Xiao Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bofei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangcheng Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaojun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian-Ying Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

We developed a novel cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylome sequencing assay that allows for integrative analysis of these genomic features for sensitive detection of multiple types of cancer.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Whole methylome sequencing (WMS) libraries were generated from enzymatically converted cfDNA. Low-pass (~2X) paired-end NGS sequencing was performed on WMS libraries and paired whole genome sequencing (WGS) libraries of unconverted cfDNA for technical comparison and analytical validation. For development of cancer detection models, we profiled the genome-wide methylation density (MD), fragment size index (FSI), fragment end motif (motif) and chromosome instability (CIN) based on WMS data from a discovery cohort of 352 healthy controls and 559 newly diagnosed cancer patients (45 breast, 105 colorectal, 44 esophageal, 79 gastric, 79 liver, 110 lung, 83 pancreatic, and 14 others), 34.5% of which were at stage I or II. Machine learning models, including KNN, SVM, LR, GBDT, and random forest were trained and tested for individual biomarker types, with a final ensemble classifier to integrate all biomarkers. Performance of the predictive model was confirmed on an independent validation cohort consisting of 145 healthy controls and 236 cancer patients (21 breast, 45 colorectal, 18 esophageal, 35 gastric, 34 liver, 47 lung, and 36 pancreatic), among which 31.8% were at early stages (I or II).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>WMS and WGS data from 512 cfDNA samples showed high concordance in CIN (R=0.988, 95% CI: 0.986-0.990) and FSI (R=0.961, 0.954-0.967) profiles. On the independent validation cohort, the optimal model selected for each of individual genomic features achieved following area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for cancer detection: MD-KNN, 0.830 (0.789-0.870); FSI-SVM, 0.904 (0.874-0.933); motif-SVM, 0.943 (0.920-0.966); and CIN-PAscore, 0.812 (0.770-0.854). The ensemble classifier based on linear SVM outperformed individual biomarkers, with an AUC value of 0.952 (0.934-0.971), which translated to, at 95% specificity, detection sensitivity of 66.7% for breast, 77.8% for colorectal, 83.3% for esophageal, 62.9% for gastric, 82.4% for liver, 66.0% for lung, and 77.8% for pancreatic cancers. Noteworthily, the overall sensitivity on early-stage cancer was 74.7%.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: These results demonstrate the first proof of principle on the feasibility of integrating multiple genomic cancer markers on the same WMS technical platform. Low-pass WMS on plasma cfDNA from 10ml of blood with integrative multimodal analysis of methylation, fragmentation, and CNV profiles yields in satisfactory sensitivity and specificity for detection of multiple types of cancer, warranting a forthcoming prospective study to further assess its clinical performance in a larger cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a5c0abb-ae00-4ff6-a57f-2fbfa031bd0b\/@w03B8ZQK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Early detection,Methylation,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18501"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yulong Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fenglong Bie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fengwei Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiancheng Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunli Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fang Lv<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peiyao Nie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuanyuan Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhijie Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weizhi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shugeng Gao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Detection of methylation changes in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can offer a novel approach for cancer diagnostics.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> Plasma samples from healthy controls and from patients with advanced colorectal and non-colorectal cancers were included in the study. Bisulfite conversion of cfDNA extracted from plasma was performed using EZ DNA Methylation Lightning Kit (Zymo Research) and was followed by library preparation using Accel-NGS Methyl-Seq DNA Library Kit (Swift Biosciences) and target enrichment using xGen Hybridization Capture for NGS Kit (IDT). Targeted methylation sequencing was done using NextSeq500 mid-output flow cell (300 cycles) (Illumina). Detection rates of methylation ratios in colorectal cancer samples were compared to non-colorectal cancers and healthy controls.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> First, we reviewed methylation changes in nearly 9,000 CpG sites in colorectal cancer (through TCGA database) and healthy controls. Subsequently, 32 CpG sites with greater than 50% methylation ratio in colorectal cancer and less than 1% methylation ratio in healthy controls were selected to develop targeted methylation sequencing based cfDNA assay. The assay was performed in 32 plasma samples from 20 individuals with advanced colorectal cancer who had tumor <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation, 8 individuals with advanced non-colorectal cancer who had tumor <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation (ovarian, n=2; endometrial, n=2; pancreatic, n=2; and lung cancer, n=2), and 4 healthy controls. Colorectal cancer specific methylation changes in cfDNA were detected in 85% (17\/20) of colorectal cancer patients with a specificity of 92%. In colorectal cancer patients with confirmed <i>KRAS <\/i>mutation in cfDNA, methylation changes were detected in 92% (11\/12) in comparison to 75% (6\/8) in colorectal cancer patients without <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation in cfDNA. Median methylation ratio for target CpG sites was higher in colorectal cancer patients compared to patients with non-colorectal cancers and healthy controls (p&#60;0.001). In 17 colorectal cancer patients with plasma samples collected before initiation of systemic cancer therapy, detection of methylation changes in cfDNA was associated with a shorter median progression-free survival compared to no detection (PFS; 8 weeks versus 54 weeks; p=0.027).<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS: <\/b>Targeted methylation sequencing of cfDNA demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detection of colorectal cancer-specific cfDNA.

Sequencing was performed on Nextseq500 system (Illumina) followed by mutation analyses using an Avenio Oncology Analysis Server (Roche Diagnostics).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Mutations in <i>EGFR<\/i> gene were detected in 10 out of 13 cfDNA samples (77%) including T790M\/cis-C797S mutations before treatment and among those harboring T790M\/cis-C797S mutations, 2 patients had progressive disease (PD) and 1 had stable disease (SD), indicating little benefit from the combination therapy in this genotype. Although other mutations in genes such as <i>TP53<\/i> and\/or <i>KRAS<\/i> were detected before treatment, no relevant associations were observed between tumor response or progression-free survival. One patient who had SD harbored <i>CNTN5<\/i> mutation at PD, suggesting the potential involvement with the acquired resistance. Early emergence of <i>EGFR<\/i> G796S mutation observed in one patient after the initiation of the treatment along with basal L858R\/T790M mutations may confer early resistance to the treatment. We also observed the emergence of <i>MET<\/i> amplification in 2 patients and <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification in 1 patient at PD, strongly suggesting the potential mechanisms responsible for resistance.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This signal seeking biomarker study using cfDNA to better understand the association of mutational status and the treatment efficacy of the combined treatment was feasible and informative despite the small-scale study, supporting the advantage of further implementation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3f472d28-69a5-4efc-a145-4776054977fb\/@w03B8ZQK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,EGFR TKI resistance,Lung cancer,Cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18504"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yasuhiro Koh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoru Miura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Oyanagi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshige Yoshioka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koichi Azuma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hidenobu Ishii<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kayoko Kibata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenichi Koyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunsuke Teraoka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuichi Ozawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takaaki Tokito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshio Shimokawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takayasu Kurata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nobuyuki Yamamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Tanaka<\/i><\/presenter>.

It has been reported that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) may better capture the heterogeneity of acquired resistance than tumor biopsy. This study aims to develop a noninvasive digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of <i>HER2<\/i> amplification in the plasma cfDNA of breast cancer patients. We further examine the concordance rate of <i>HER2<\/i> amplification detected by blood-based digital PCR with tissue-based IHC\/FISH tests.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> Plasma samples from 32 breast cancer patients were prospectively collected at Queen Elizabeth Hospital (Hong Kong SAR, China). According to previous IHC\/FISH records, 15 patients were scored as <i>HER2<\/i> amplified (IHC score 3 and\/or FISH positive) and 17 patients as <i>HER2<\/i> non-amplified. The detection of plasma cfDNA was performed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The <i>EFTUD2<\/i> gene was used as a reference and <i>HER2:EFTUD2<\/i> ratio was assessed by ddPCR on the plasma DNA from cancer samples.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A median of 1.47 (range 0.92-3.83) was detected in the <i>HER2<\/i> amplified patients and a median of 1.03 (range 0.76-1.23) was detected in the <i>HER2<\/i> non-amplified patients by ddPCR. Our results showed that using 1.30 as the cutoff, ddPCR assay could well detect <i>HER2<\/i> amplification. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic ability of this ddPCR assay and it returned an area under the curve of 0.898. A diagnostic test was used to evaluate the concordance of this ddPCR assay with the IHC\/FISH tests and determine the sensitivity (73.33%), specificity (100%), accuracy (87.5%), positive predictive value (100%), and negative predictive value (81%) of the ddPCR assay.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Accurate reporting of <i>HER2<\/i> amplification status is a prerequisite for the appropriate choice of targeted therapy. We have obtained a high level of concordance in comparison to tissue-based IHC\/FISH when cfDNA ddPCR assay was used to determine <i>HER2<\/i> amplification in breast cancer patients. Most importantly, we have established a great accuracy of the ddPCR assay. Increasing studies have reported that <i>HER2<\/i> levels may change during targeted therapy, but there are additional risks of patients by the invasive nature of IHC\/FISH tests. Our results support the potential application of blood-based ddPCR assay to monitor the changes of <i>HER2<\/i> amplification status in breast cancer patients during targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d54471e5-b916-4b68-8ea8-0816fe6b59ff\/@w03B8ZQK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Digital PCR,HER2,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18506"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William C.

However, more than 50% of patients receiving the first or second generations of TKI develop a resistance mutation, EGFR-T790M, and they will need to switch to the third-generation TKI (Osimertinib). Upon treatment, a second acquired mutation, EGFR-C797S, leads to the resistance to Osimertinib. If the C797S and T790M mutations are located in trans, a combination of the first and third-generation of TKI(s) may offer some benefit to the patient. The impact of the allelic context to the subsequent treatment is yet to be established and thus an assay identifying C797S and T790M allelic context may serve as a useful research tool. In recent years, digital PCR has emerged to be an ultra-sensitive method in non-invasive identification and monitoring of cancer mutations. However, compared to qPCR and NGS methods, current digital PCR assays are limited by the number of biomarkers that can be incorporated in a single assay and the maximum sample volume that can be screened in one test. In this study, we describe a multiplex digital PCR assay for quantitative detection of EGFR sensitizing and resistance mutations, and identification of C797S and T790M allelic context, using a 6-color digital PCR system that allows high sample volume utilization. The sensitivity and specificity of this multiplex dPCR assay were tested using a panel of contrived cell-free DNA samples. Individual mutations can be detected at as low as 0.2% fractional abundance level. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the multiplex with the 2-color droplet digital PCR Expert Design Assays on the Bio-Rad QX200 ddPCR system, using a commercial multiplex cfDNA reference standard set. The multiplexed EGFR mutation assay on the 6-color Digital LightCycler&#174; System is a promising method for rapid and sensitive monitoring of EGFR mutations in cell-free DNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9523e331-7227-45a6-bb80-2e7be05bb71c\/@w03B8ZQK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Cell-free DNA,Mutation detection,Droplet digital PCR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18507"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wei Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mari Christensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer K.

However, as only a subset of patients derives clinical benefit from regorafenib, it is essential to identify biomarker to predict therapeutic response. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a valuable non-invasive tool to identify tumor heterogeneity and tumor burden. This study investigated ctDNA dynamics in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This is a prospective biomarker study including patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib (ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT01996969). Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were refractory to standard therapies (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) were eligible for the current study. Patients received oral regorafenib 160 mg once daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle and were treated until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or decision by the treating physicians. Blood samples were obtained prior to regorafenib treatment and after every two cycles of regorafenib treatment until disease progression. ctDNA was detected by AlphaLiquid&#174; 100 target capture panel (IMBdx, Inc., Seoul, South Korea). Alphaliquid&#174; 100 is a tumor agnostic panel consist of 106 genes, including 10 gene fusion and MSI. Variant allele frequency (VAF) amount was calculated by adding the VAF value of all altered genes.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 110 patients were included in the present study.

Blood samples after two cycle of regorafenib was acquired in 106 patients, and was acquired in 95 patients after disease progression. Among 104 patients with baseline and follow-up cfDNA, the mean VAF at baseline was 12.8% and 7.2% in follow-up.

VAF decreased markedly after 2 cycles of regorafenib in several genes, including <i>CSF1R<\/i>, <i>JAK3<\/i>, <i>KIT<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i>, and <i>TERT<\/i>. Although, VAF change of specific gene was not associated with regorafenib outcome, VAF change of whole gene was an early predictive marker for regorafenib.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) constitute a unique source of information at thecellular level. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a valuable tool for accurate and valid mutation analysisin liquid biopsy. The aim of the current study was to detect EGFR mutations in plasma cfDNA and paired CTC-fractions of NSCLC patients before the initiation of osimertinib therapy and at progression of disease using crystal digital PCR (cdPCR).<br \/><b>Patients and Methods:<\/b> Forty-eight patients with EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinomas resistant to 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKIs were treated with osimertinib in the context of a multicenter Phase II clinical study (NCT02771314). 2 mL of plasma were used for cfDNA extraction using the IDXtract kit (ID-Solutions, France). Crystal dPCR (naica&#174; system, StillaTechnologies, France) was used to quantify mutation allele frequencies (MAF) of EGFRmutations in 91 cfDNA samples before and after osimertinib. 80 identical plasma samples were also analyzed with the FDA-approved cobas&#174; technology. In parallel, EGFR mutations were detected with cdPCR in 64 matched CTC-fractions enriched by Parsortix&#8482; (ANGLE plc, UK).Quality control steps were followed both at the preanalytical and analytical level.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Direct comparison between cdPCR and cobas&#174; revealed high concordance rates forall EGFR mutations; however, in case of T790M, cdPCR proved to be more sensitive. Patients with higher %MAFs at PD presented significantly lower PFS compared to those with lower levels or without EGFR mutations. Direct comparison of EGFR genotyping between primary tissue and baseline plasma cfDNA samples revealed high concordance rates, too. During EGFR mutation analysis in paired CTC-derived gDNA, 11 samples were found positive for EGFR mutations with %MAF ranging from 0.2 to 2.25%.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Crystal dPCR combines the unique benefits of sensitivity and accuracy with the multiplexing capacity for the detection of multiple EGFR mutations in plasma cfDNA samples and CTCs. High concordance rates were observed between cdPCR and cobas&#174; assay. For the first time, cdPCR was applied to detect EGFR mutations in CTC-derived gDNA of NSCLC patients under osimertinib. Discordance between plasma and CTC-fractions might be indicative of tumor heterogeneity and predictive for acquired resistance.<br \/><b><i>Acknowledgements<\/i><\/b><i>-The<\/i><i> <\/i><i>research<\/i><i> <\/i><i>presented<\/i><i> <\/i><i>was<\/i><i> <\/i><i>carried<\/i><i> <\/i><i>out<\/i><i> <\/i><i>within<\/i><i> <\/i><i>the<\/i><i> <\/i><i>framework<\/i><i> <\/i><i>of<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Stavros<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Niarchos<\/i><i>Foundation grant to the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens<\/i><i>-The<\/i><i> <\/i><i>authors<\/i><i> <\/i><i>would<\/i><i> <\/i><i>like<\/i><i> <\/i><i>to<\/i><i> <\/i><i>thank<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Larry<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Ba<\/i><i> <\/i><i>(Stilla<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Technologies,<\/i><i> <\/i><i>France)<\/i><i> <\/i><i>and<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Daniel<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Henaff<\/i><i>(ID-solutions,<\/i><i> <\/i><i>France)<\/i><i> <\/i><i>for<\/i><i> <\/i><i>kindly<\/i><i> <\/i><i>providing<\/i><i> <\/i><i>the<\/i><i> <\/i><i>naica&#174;<\/i><i> <\/i><i>digital<\/i><i> <\/i><i>PCR<\/i><i> <\/i><i>system<\/i><i> <\/i><i>and<\/i><i> <\/i><i>the<\/i><i> <\/i><i>ID-solutions<\/i><i>kits, respectively.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/451d5f50-b36d-4979-8f2b-abea8d8a265e\/@x03B8ZQL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,NSCLC,EGFR TKI resistance,Osimertinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18509"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aliki Ntzifa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Athanasios Kotsakis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vassilis Georgoulias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evi Lianidou<\/i><\/presenter>.

The DELFI liquid biopsy approach (DNA evaluation of fragments for early interception) utilizing low coverage (1-2x) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to analyze cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation provides a promising avenue for cancer detection. As sequencing costs remain a barrier to adoption of liquid biopsy approaches for early detection, we evaluated WGS for DELFI using 2-channel Illumina NovaSeq sequencing as a more affordable (~7-fold cost savings) alternative to 4-channel HiSeq instruments.<br \/>Methods: We performed WGS on the prospectively collected LUCAS cohort of 365 individuals at risk for lung cancer using both HiSeq and NovaSeq platforms (Mathios et. al., Nature Communications 2021). Genome-wide fragmentation was summarized in non-overlapping 5 Mb bins by ratio of short (100-150 bp) to long (151-220 bp) fragments.To measure within-sequencer repeatability, we compared fragmentation profiles of non-cancer individuals to the median non-cancer fragmentation profile by Spearman correlation. Principal component analyses were performed to assess the extent to which the sequencer explains variation of fragmentation profiles across samples.For cancer prediction, we used a penalized logistic regression model with fragmentation profiles and other genome-wide characteristics as features. Machine learning performance was assessed by cross-validation and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). To evaluate whether we could have developed the classifier from a combination of NovaSeq with HiSeq sequenced samples, we evaluated performance trained on 90:10%, 75:25%, 50:50%, 25:75%, and 10:90% HiSeq:NovaSeq mixtures, respectively.<br \/>Results: cfDNA fragmentation profiles were highly concordant among non-cancer individuals for both platforms with median correlations of 0.96 (IQR: 0.95 - 0.97) and 0.95 (IQR: 0.94 - 0.96). Visualization of fragmentation principal components did not reveal separation by sequencing platform. The DELFI approach applied to samples sequenced by NovaSeq recapitulated previously published performance measures based on HiSeq (AUC 0.90, 95% CI 0.86 - 0.94). In simulations of mixed-platform datasets, we found the same qualitative performance (AUC range: 0.893-0.902).<br \/>Conclusions: cfDNA fragmentation profiles were similar between HiSeq and NovaSeq platforms, and classification accuracies from machine learning models trained on these platforms were equivalent. Our results indicate HiSeq and NovaSeq sequenced samples can be combined in models with no discernible loss in classification accuracy provided a balance of non-cancers and cancers are sequenced on both platforms. The lower cost of NovaSeq sequencing may enable wider adoption of genome-wide fragmentation-based approaches for cancer detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/00127215-9969-429c-8676-8c16606e756b\/@x03B8ZQL\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"cfDNA,Biomarkers,Machine learning,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18510"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akshaya V.

One of the most important resistance mechanisms is the presence of <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutations. The aim of the current study was the development and analytical validation of a highly sensitive and specific NaME-PrO-assisted ARMS (NAPA) assay for the detection of four <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations (Y537S, Y537C, Y537N and D538G) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and corresponding plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with ER+ BrCa.<br \/>Methods: We first developed the assay and validated the analytical specificity, analytical sensitivity and reproducibility. We further evaluated the performance of the developed assay in CTCs and ctDNA derived from 13 ER+ BrCa primary tumor tissues and 64 liquid biopsy samples: 32 EpCAM-isolated cell fractions and 32 corresponding plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) obtained at different time points from 8 ER+ metastatic breast cancer patients, during a 5-year follow-up period and peripheral blood from 11 healthy donors (HD). We further compared the performance of the <i>ESR1<\/i> NAPA assay with drop-off droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), using identical samples.<br \/>Results: The developed assay is highly sensitive (detection of mutation-allelic-frequency of 0.5% for D538G and 0.1% for Y537S, Y537C, Y537N), and highly specific (0\/13 mammoplasties and 0\/11 HD for all mutations). In plasma ctDNA, <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations were not identified at the baseline whereas the D538G mutation was detected in five sequential cfDNA samples during the follow-up period in the same patient. The developed assay gave comparable results with ddPCR, since the concordance between the <i>ESR1<\/i> NAPA assay and drop-off ddPCR as evaluated using 32 identical cfDNA samples was 90.6% (29\/32). In EpCAM-isolated cell fractions only the Y537C mutation was detected in one patient sample at baseline.<br \/>Conclusions: We present a low cost, highly specific, sensitive and robust assay for blood-based ESR1 profiling. The developed assay is fast, with a comparable sensitivity to ddPCR but has lower cost relative to ddPCR, and thus can be used as a fast screening method to classify patients as positive or negative for <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations. Our results are consistent with reports that indicate that <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations (especially D538G, Y537S) are associated with more aggressive disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor,Breast cancer,Circulating tumor cells,Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18511"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dimitra Stergiopoulou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Athina Markou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eleni Tzanikou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ioannis Ladas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>G.

Transient disease control in the first-line setting is achieved via inhibition of tyrosine kinase signaling using the KIT inhibitor imatinib. As patients progress through subsequent lines of therapy a molecularly heterogeneous disease evolves, characterized by distinct subtypes and shifting repertoires of exon-specific KIT variants which directly impact treatment outcomes. Here, we use tumor-informed exome-scale liquid biopsy to identify and track the evolution of multiple resistance mechanisms in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to address the unmet need of comprehensive understanding of GIST evolution in response to therapy.<br \/>Matched tumor, normal and serial plasma samples were obtained from 15 heavily pretreated metastatic GIST patients. Following baseline sample collection, all patients received systemic TKI therapy, and were monitored until disease progression. Exome-scale detection of somatic variants in cfDNA from longitudinal matched plasma samples was achieved using the NeXT Liquid BiopsyTM platform. The ImmunoID NeXT Platform&#9415;, an augmented exome\/transcriptome platform and analysis pipeline which generates comprehensive tumor and immune data was used to profile paired tumor and normal samples.<br \/>Longitudinal whole exome sequencing of plasma identified dynamic shifts in existing clones harboring exon-specific KIT mutations, and evolution of new KIT mutations arising prior to identification of tumor progression using standard imaging techniques. We detected a correlation between the number of damaging mutations detected in baseline ctDNA and tumor exon 11 KIT mutation status, suggesting that plasma mutation profiles may be KIT-variant dependent. ctDNA from patients with shorter overall survival (OS) was enriched for variants in the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathway, potentially contributing to immune evasion observed in those patients. Additional associations were observed between gene copy-number changes and OS (P = .0097). Previous studies have demonstrated that immune infiltration and activity may be KIT variant specific, here we broaden those findings, identifying a significant correlation between TCR&#593; clonality and variants detected only in plasma (P = .04), as well as a significant association between TCR&#946; diversity and OS (HR =&#8201;2.55, log rank P = .04).<br \/>Comprehensive profiling of paired tumor tissue (WES and RNA-Seq) and WES of serially collected ctDNA sensitively and repeatedly identified evolving KIT mutations and other molecular alterations prior to radiologically confirmed disease progression. These findings suggest plasma-based monitoring of late-stage GIST malignancies may be useful for non-invasive disease tracking, providing treatment guidance prior to traditional approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c01220d0-fe00-42cb-b793-5584bb6fec11\/@x03B8ZQL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Circulating tumor DNA,Whole exome sequencing,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18512"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Charles W.

We developed TuFEst (Tumor Fraction Estimator), a cost-effective computational approach for pan-cancer detection and tumor burden estimation from ultra-low coverage whole genome sequencing (~0.1x, ULP-WGS) of minimally invasive cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Current state-of-the-art methods estimate tumor fraction (TF) from ULP-WGS depending exclusively on total copy number variation, which loses tumor signal in either copy number-quiet tumors or tumors with copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity. Additionally, it is difficult in many cases to distinguish clonal from sub-clonal copy-number events, therefore complicating the ability to estimate tumor fraction. On the other hand, fragments shed into the blood from cancer cells, i.e., circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), of various cancer types show significantly different length distribution than that from normal cells in healthy donors. By synergistically integrating both (i) copy number variation and (ii) altered fragment length signals, TuFEst successfully achieved higher sensitivity and more accurate TF estimation than current methods in &#62;200 cfDNA samples across different cancer types, even in low tumor-fraction cases (TF &#60; 0.1%). Application of TuFEst to serial cfDNA samples from blood biopsies demonstrate its utility in accurately estimating TF in ~100 cfDNAs, suggesting that TuFEst can be used to detect early cancer recurrence during different treatments. In one breast cancer patient receiving CDK4\/6 therapy, TuFEst indicated disease progression 262 days earlier than routine imaging. Altogether, our work suggests that accurate TF estimation from cfDNA can not only aid in detecting cancer at early stages but also provide evidence of disease progression during treatment. We believe that such a non-invasive, cost-effective, pan-cancer detection method will benefit both initial cancer screening and monitoring of resistance to therapy in clinical applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4ee60c13-7aba-4796-a748-e8eb81e2d4c3\/@x03B8ZQL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Genomics,Statistical approach,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18513"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ziao Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chip Stewart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth E.

However, current liquid biopsy MRD assays typically detect ctDNA in a range above 30 to 300 parts per million (PPM), leaving a significant fraction of MRD cases undetected, particularly soon after surgery and in early stage cancers where ctDNA can be at very low levels. To address this, we have developed NeXT Personal&#8482;, a tumor-informed liquid biopsy assay that achieves sensitivity down to 1 PPM, therefore enabling earlier detection of MRD and recurrence.<br \/>NeXT Personal leverages tumor\/normal whole genome sequencing to design personalized MRD liquid biopsy panels for each patient. The panel is composed of &#62;1,200 somatic tumor variants enabling higher sensitivity MRD detection in plasma through tracking of larger numbers of high quality and lower noise variants. This allows the platform to achieve high sensitivity across cancer types and stages, including early stage cancers and low mutational burden tumors, utilizing ~4 mL of plasma. Two independent methods were used to establish utility and performance: a proprietary cell-line media system, and well-characterized matched tumor-normal-plasma patient samples. Samples were serially diluted to &#60;1 PPM, with replicates used to confirm performance. Digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was used to orthogonally validate platform performance to the limit of detection (LOD) of ddPCR.<br \/>Characterization of MRD LOD in three cell-line media systems, HCC1143, HCC38, and HCC1937, yielded accurate and reproducible detection of signal across a broad range of concentrations, to a lower limit of 1-2 PPM. We then used our platform to characterize MRD LOD in a set of serially diluted patient samples, demonstrating sensitivity down to as low as 1 PPM, with high specificity in normal control samples. Finally, we demonstrated the performance of NeXT Personal with matched tumor-normal-plasma patient samples (8 different cancer types, stages II-IV). In this series, NeXT Personal detected cancers down to 0.8 PPM with high specificity demonstrated across a set of healthy normal donor samples. We estimate that ~50% of the cases in this set of patients would not have been detected by other commercially available liquid biopsy MRD platforms.<br \/>NeXT Personal achieved highly sensitive and specific MRD detection, reproducibly demonstrating a LOD down to 1 PPM in different cancer types and cell line dilutions, representing approximately 10 to 100 times higher sensitivity than other liquid biopsy MRD approaches. The high sensitivity of NeXT Personal potentially enables MRD detection across a broad variety of cancers and stages, including typically challenging early stage, low mutational burden, and low-shedding cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b185c56f-c8cf-44c0-9f5d-322875a57ba8\/@x03B8ZQL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Minimal Residual Disease,Cell-free DNA,Recurrence Detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18514"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sean Michael Boyle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabor Bartha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Lyle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Harris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josette Northcott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Norton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Marty Pyke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabio C.

We hypothesized that the fragment size of cfDNA can be utilized to reliably estimate tumor burden in patients with mCRC undergoing palliative chemotherapy.<br \/>Methods: cfDNA sequencing data from mCRC patients receiving first-line palliative chemotherapy at Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul, Korea) were used for this analysis. The patients were enrolled in a main study evaluating the dynamic changes of circulating tumor DNA mutational profiles during chemotherapy. Blood samples were obtained prior to chemotherapy and after every four cycles of chemotherapy until disease progression. cfDNA sequencing data from normal individuals were used as control data. cfDNA sequencing for both cancer patients and normal individuals were performed using AlphaLiquid&#174; 100 target capture panel (IMBdx, Inc., Seoul, South Korea). AlphaLiquid&#174; 100 is a tumor agnostic panel consist of 106 genes, including 10 gene fusion and MSI. Based on the panel sequencing data, the genetic alterations and the fragment size of cfDNA were calculated. The fragmentation ratio was defined by the ratio of the read fragment proportion in size range P1 (100 - 155 bp) and P2 (160 - 180 bp).<br \/>Results: cfDNA sequencing data from 280 plasma samples from 62 mCRC patients and 50 healthy controls were used for analysis. Compared to cfDNA from healthy controls, the cfDNA fragment sizes from mCRC patients were significantly shorter (169.585 bp vs. 173.964 bp; <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.001). Comparing the fragment sizes by the mutational status, the fragment sizes of alleles with detected somatic mutations were significantly shorter than those with reference alleles (mean fragment size 155.853 bp in alleles with somatic mutations vs. 160.613 bp in reference alleles; <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.001), but such difference was not observed with germline mutations (mean fragment size 160.911 bp in alleles with germline mutations vs. 159.889 bp in reference alleles; <i>p<\/i> = 0.992). Further, the clonality inferred from the variant allele frequency (VAF) of somatic mutation was negatively correlated with the size of the cfDNA fragment. The read fragment proportion in size range P1 was significantly associated with the clonality (r = 0.86, <i>p<\/i> &#60;0.001). We calculated the mean size of DNA fragment and the fragmentation ratio with each longitudinal sample. The fragmentation ratio was found to decrease with chemotherapy in responders and re-increase at the time of resistance to chemotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: The fragmentation ratio calculated from cfDNA in mCRC patients can represent tumor burden in dynamic samples and potentially can be used as a biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c5f4bd15-fa4e-4333-b439-c330a393883f\/@x03B8ZQL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Colorectal cancer,Fragmentation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18515"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jun-Kyu Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hwang-Phill Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yoojoo Lim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Su Yeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae-You Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

To better understand the molecular alterations associated with response to PI3K inhibition, we profiled the genomic landscape of ctDNA collected from <i>PIK3CA<\/i>mut, ER+, HER2- aBC pts immediately prior to treatment (tx) with TAS or placebo (PBO) plus fulvestrant (FUL).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Pts were enrolled as part of a phase III randomized study of TAS or PBO plus FUL in ER+, HER2- <i>PIK3CA<\/i>mut aBC (SANDPIPER, NCT02340221).

The top mutated genes were analyzed for prognostic value against investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for both tx regimens using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. As analysis was exploratory, no adjustments were made for multiple testing.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The top altered genes were <i>TP53 <\/i>(44%), <i>ESR1 <\/i>(37%), <i>CDH1<\/i> (17%), <i>FGFR1 <\/i>(12%), <i>NF1 <\/i>(11%)<i>, CHEK2<\/i> (10%), and <i>PTEN <\/i>(9%). In pts treated with PBO+FUL, alterations in <i>PTEN<\/i> (HR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4-5.7; p=0.0107) and <i>TP53 <\/i>(HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-3.1; p=0.0025) were associated with a worse prognosis compared to pts with no mutation detected (NMD) in these genes. In pts treated with TAS+FUL, alterations in <i>FGFR1 <\/i>(HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.5-3.7; p=0.0006), <i>TP53 <\/i>(HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.4-2.6; p=0.0001) and <i>PTEN<\/i> (HR 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-2.8; p=0.0265) were associated with a worse prognosis compared to pts with NMD in these genes.

CTC-based liquid biopsies can aid in earlier diagnosis, identify the stage of disease, guide therapeutic aggressiveness, and be used to monitor response to treatment. While CTCs hold incredible promise in these areas, there are inherent limitations that hinder realization of the full potential of CTC-based liquid biopsy tests. The rarity of CTCs is one of the most significant factors limiting clinical utility. A standard 10-mL blood draw may simply not contain the number of CTCs needed to yield meaningful results. One method to analyze greater blood volume is by leukapheresis. While clinical leukapheresis can enrich mononuclear cells, including CTCs, from almost the entire volume of a patient&#8217;s blood, most downstream CTC enrichment methods are not compatible with leukapheresis material as a starting sample. To overcome these compatibility issues, Akadeum Life Sciences has developed a novel and proprietary Buoyancy Activated Cell Sorting (BACS&#8482;) microbubble platform that can be functionalized to selectively enrich biological samples for target cell populations using a fast, easy protocol that is exceptionally gentle on delicate cells of interest. Akadeum&#8217;s low-density BACS microbubbles are mixed into the sample where they quickly engage their targets and naturally float them to the surface for removal. This straightforward approach is elegant in simplicity and powerful in application, offering some of the fastest and most gentle isolations available. In this study, we demonstrate a protocol for the depletion of white blood cells (WBCs) &#38; residual red blood cells (RBCs) from leukapheresis material via microbubbles. This novel protocol reveals a &#62; 99% combined depletion of residual RBCs and WBCs, providing over 120-fold enrichment of tumor cells. Importantly, this protocol delivers exceptional yield with &#62; 99% retention of the target tumor cells. This optimized workflow delivers an enriched and viable population of untouched and unaltered CTCs for downstream use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec1be20c-0e7e-42ed-bc7a-867dac423f75\/@x03B8ZQL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor cells,Cancer cell isolation,Cancer diagnostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18518"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Edward Grimley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jon Roussey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia Ku<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolina Livi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadia Petlakh-Co<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Casey Wegner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon H.

For patient stratification, the current prognostication relies on tumor stage and grade, which remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate biomarker(s) to monitor disease progress. Therefore, there is an urgent need for predictive biomarkers that can distinguish between progressive versus non-progressive disease for the identification of patients to better stratify their risk of progression. Here we aim to identify novel prognostic biomarker(s) associated with disease progression by exploring bladder cancer patient gene expression database. We explored and analyzed the transcriptomic gene expression of bladder cancer patient datasets consisting of NIMBC and MIBC subtype from the NCBI GEO (GSE154261, GSE57813, and GSE37317) database. These datasets were analyzed using GEO2R (an R-based web application) and Limma R packages. Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the NMIBC and MIBC group was analyzed using the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), metascape web-based portal, and Cytoscape. The above finding was functionally validated in human bladder cancer cell lines; RT4 (transitional cell papilloma), J82 (transitional cell carcinoma), HT1197 (bladder carcinoma), and 253JB-V (metastatic phenotype) and compared with the relative expression ofUROtsa (benign) urothelial cell line. A total of 1516 DEGs were identified between non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer specimens. To identify genes of prognostic value, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Gene and Genomic encyclopedia (KEGG)analysis. A total of seven genes including<i> CDKN2A<\/i>,<i> CDC20<\/i>,<i> CTSV<\/i>,<i> FOXM1<\/i>,<i> MAGEA6<\/i>,<i> KRT23<\/i>, and<i> S100A9<\/i> were confirmed with strong prognostic values in bladder cancer and validated by qRT-PCR conducted in various human bladder cancer cells representing stage-specific disease progression. ULCAN, human protein atlas, and The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets were used to confirm the predictive value of these genes in bladder cancer progression. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox-hazard ratio analysis were performed to determine the prognostic role of these genes. Univariate analysis performed on a validation set identified a 3-panel gene set viz.<i> CDKN2A<\/i>,<i> CTSV<\/i> and<i> FOXM1<\/i> with 95.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity in predicting bladder cancer progression. Our study screened and confirmed a panel of a 3-genes biomarkers that could precisely predict the progression and prognosis of bladder cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8453f6ab-b2ed-4efd-9b11-090d7afff222\/@x03B8ZQL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Biomarkers,Prognosis,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18519"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shiv Shankar Verma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eswar Shankar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Spencer Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vaibhav Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>E.

A 12-gene signature score was significantly associated with PFS (p&#60;0.0001) and produced a bootstrap cross-validated C index of 0.888. Stratifying by SLN status the gene signature risk score remained highly significant (p&#60;0.0001). In univariate analysis, Breslow thickness (HR=1.41), presence of ulceration (HR=3.61), SLN positivity (HR=2.50), and acral-lentiginous histology compared to nodular (HR=4.07) were each significantly associated with PFS (all p&#60;0.05). After simultaneously adjusting for all of these factors plus the gene signature, the 12-gene score remained a significant predictor for PFS (p&#60;0.0001).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>A SLN 12-gene signature risk score is associated with melanoma progression regardless of SLN status and can be used as a prognostic factor for PFS of patients.

This study aimed to identify prognostic signatures in IR-RMS, the clinical subgroup with the most heterogeneous outcomes, which can potentially improve risk stratification compared with routine clinicopathologic metrics. Signature performance was validated on an independent set of RMS patients.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> Prospectively obtained primary tumor specimens from 80 IR-RMS patients on Children&#8217;s Oncology Group clinical trial protocols formed the training set. Tumors from 54 RMS patients across all clinical risk groups formed the validation set. Whole transcriptome profiling was performed using oligonucleotide microarrays employing nearly 1.4 million probe selection regions (PSRs) and used to derive weighted meta-features. Accuracies of protein-coding and non-coding meta-features to predict overall (OS) and event-free (EFS) survival were compared using areas under receiver operating characteristic curves. Associated biological processes were analyzed using curated pathway analysis tools.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> <i>PAX-FKHR<\/i> status was able to predict OS (p=0.041) and EFS (p=0.008) in the validation set, but not in the training set. Histologic subtype followed a similar predictive pattern. Cox regression on over 17,000 coding genes on the training set identified a prognostic 30-coding gene meta-feature (gMF; OS p=0.001, EFS p=0.012). A similar analysis on non-coding transcripts identified a 39-PSR meta-feature (ncMF; OS, EFS p&#60;0.001). Both gMF and ncMF were able to predict OS and EFS (p&#8804;0.023) in the validation cohort. Based on OS, predictive accuracy of ncMF was higher than gMF (96% vs. 71%, p&#60;0.001). Analysis of biological processes using gMF showed enrichment for functions associated with musculoskeletal development and signaling pathways. Similar analysis of non-coding meta-features revealed enrichment for cellular assembly, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cancer-associated functions.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> A non-coding RNA meta-feature was able to better predict outcome in IR-RMS than a coding gene meta-feature, where most standard clinical prognosticators failed. The meta-features were independently validated in IR and non-IR RMS. This suggests that non-coding transcripts can regulate and determine RMS biology and aggressiveness, and be used as novel prognostic indicators.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9a524a70-2873-42eb-ba56-745e754e22d5\/@y03B8ZQM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Outcome,Prognostic markers,Molecular profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18521"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Anirban P.

However, some 10% of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) is missed with current MRI sequences. Evidence on biological differences between MRI visible and invisible csPCa is scarce. Our aim was to find out, whether MRI invisible lesions harbor more indolent characteristics compared to visible csPCa lesions, and to identify transcript markers of MRI visibility.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective cohort of 45 radical prostatectomy-treated men with csPCa, including 30 with MRI visible lesions, 15 with MRI invisible lesions and additional 19 benign controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the invisible lesions were measured based on their topographical locations in histological slides. The histological slides were checked for histological subtypes of PCa and the prostate epithelium and stroma surface area were measured using machine learning. mRNA was analyzed using Nanostring nCounter platform. First, hierarchical clustering of transcript copy counts was performed. Next, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between study groups were analyzed and Reactome pathway analysis was performed to identify genes and pathways responsible for MRI visibility. Random forest models (RFMs) were trained to predict MRI visibility using DEGs, and genes in MSK-IMPACT, Decipher, Oncotype DX and Prolaris. RFMs were also trained to predict metastatic and lethal PCa using DEGs.<br \/>Results: MRI negative lesions remained invisible upon radiologist re-evaluation. Clinicopathological characteristics did not explain MRI invisibility, while ADC values were higher in invisible lesions than visible ones. Hierarchical clustering did not separate visible and invisible lesions, while benign samples formed a cluster. We identified a set of 10 and 52 DEGs and 65 enriched pathways between visible and invisible specimens. RFMs performed well in predicting MRI visibility for our 10- and 52-gene DEG sets (AUC = 0.92), for transcripts in Decipher, Oncotype DX, Prolaris (AUC = 0.69-0.86) and MSK-IMPACT (AUC = 0.93). RFMs based on 52- and 10-DEG sets showed independent value in predicting metastatic (AUC = 0.67 and 0.65) and lethal disease (AUC = 0.70 and 0.72) and the samples with predicted poor outcomes based on RFMs had significantly worse survival (p &#60; 0.0001).<br \/>Conclusions: MRI visibility is net result of many genes and might be linked to various biological processes. Invisible lesions harbor a less aggressive transcript signature than visible csPCa and might be considered for more conservative management. Further research is required to validate these findings on protein level and to find histological correlates. Promising markers altered in currently MRI invisible csPCa could be used to improve MRI sequences.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0fb7675-e71e-48ef-8d72-ba89dae9612f\/@y03B8ZQM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Magnetic resonance imaging,Transcript,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18522"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timo-Pekka K.

In contrast to stage I where surgery achieves cure for &#62;70% of patients, the majority of patients with stage II NSCLC will develop recurrent disease after surgery. The addition of chemotherapy is associated with modest improvement in survival. Biomarkers that help identify patients at higher risk of relapse following curative intent therapy remain elusive.<br \/>In this study, we performed comprehensive profiling of resected stage II lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) (n=29) to identify features associated with favorable prognostic outcomes. Whole exome (WES) and bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) were performed on frozen lung tumor specimens and corresponding normal lung tissue. Novel algorithms were used to digitally reconstruct the tumor microenvironment (TME). H&#38;E slides were reviewed to characterize the immune infiltrate and identify tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). Patient outcomes were collected and matched to pathological samples. To further validate initial findings, we then created and tested a functional B-cell signature on cohorts as described below.<br \/>In the retrospective cohort, 13 (45%) patients developed recurrent disease and 10 (34%) died during the 3+ year follow-up period. Neither the overall density of immune infiltrate nor detection of TLS predicted for improved relapse-free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS). Similarly, tumor mutational burden (assessed by WES), histological grade (assessed by RNAseq), and expression of immune checkpoints (PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA-4) were not associated with RFS or OS (log-rank test P &#62; 0.05 for both OS and RFS in all comparisons). Interestingly, higher B-cell content in the TME (stratified as high vs low based on 10% threshold value), as deconvolved using validated algorithms (and confirmed via H&#38;E review), was associated with improved OS (log-rank test P = 0.05) with a trend towards improved RFS (P = 0.2). We conducted the same analysis using a TCGA RNAseq cohort of stage II LUAD patients (n = 76) and confirmed that high B-cell levels in the TME were significantly associated with longer OS in stage II LUAD patients (P = 0.03). Finally, to validate our findings with a larger dataset, we developed a functional B-cell gene expression signature which significantly correlated with levels of B cells in both the TCGA (Spearman&#8217;s rho = 0.83, P &#60; 0.001) and 29-patient cohort (Spearman&#8217;s rho = 0.91, P &#60; 0.001). When this signature was applied to publicly available expression array data, B-cell enrichment status was significantly associated with OS in the external meta-cohort of stage II LUAD patients (log rank test P = 0.004, n=564).<br \/>Abundant B-cell infiltrate in the TME is associated with improved survival in patients with surgically resected stage II LUAD. Quantification of B-cell content using RNAseq warrants further investigation for use in routine clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/04e7d2bc-70e8-4789-878b-255c720c3c50\/@y03B8ZQM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Tumor microenvironment,B cells,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18523"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c6e31f04-631f-49b0-8720-c43042e34c17","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c6e31f04-631f-49b0-8720-c43042e34c17\/@y03B8ZQM\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ivan Valiev<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikita Kotlov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Belozerova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Lopareva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Butusova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naira Samarina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Boiko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandrine Degryse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lecia Sequist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mari Mino-Kenudson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Fowler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksander Bagaev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Lanuti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ibiayi Dagogo-Jack<\/i><\/presenter>.

The development of spatial profiling technology has enabled the deciphering of ITH with multiple analysis readouts. Advanced ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), known to harbor ITH, is chemoresistant, poor prognostic, and possesses distinct molecular and histological characteristics. However, detailed spatial information of the nature of ITH within OCCC remains unclear. Here, we utilized the NanoString Digital spatial profiling (DSP) GeoMx platform to perform multiplex protein expression analysis on tumor samples of primary and colonic metastatic sites from one advanced OCCC patient. The spatial resolution revealed the existence of an epithelial-mesenchymal (EM) gradient within the metastatic tumor but not the primary tumor, and similar EM gradient was not observed within the primary tumor. The EM gradient exhibited a distinct pattern from the periphery to the core of the metastatic tumor. Compared to tumor cells at the primary site, there was an intermediate zone in between the tumor periphery and the tumor core in the colonic metastasis with differential expression patterns of pan-cytokeratin (PanCK), fibronectin (FN), smooth muscle actin (SMA), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), integrin alpha X (ITGAX), and Ki-67. Our study provides the first spatially resolved in situ evidence of intermediate or hybrid EM states within the tumor samples of similar morphology. This not only demonstrates the promising applications of spatial profiling in precision medicine but also provides an unprecedented view of the EM gradient during the progression of cancer such as OCCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e473ff29-804f-4fc9-9468-1d575239778c\/@y03B8ZQM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Intratumoral heterogeneity,Ovarian clear cell carcinoma,Spatial profiling,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18524"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Duncan Y.T.

In order to improve the treatment and outcome of patients with hematologic malignancies, integration of accurate noninvasive molecular biomarkers to diagnose, monitor therapeutic response and identify disease subtype are critical. Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) have accelerated the utilization of circulating nucleic acids for the development of non-invasive disease biomarkers. We have developed an RNA-Seq platform that allows robust quantification of the circulating cell-free messenger RNA (cf-mRNA) whole transcriptome. Here, we conducted cf-mRNA profiling on plasma samples collected from multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia patients to investigate the feasibility of cell-free transcriptomic profiling as a monitoring tool for hematologic malignancies following bone marrow transplantation and therapeutic treatment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed cf-mRNA RNA-Sequencing on 96 longitudinally collected plasma samples from 3 multiple myeloma and 3 acute myeloid leukemia patients. Cf-mRNA profiles of patients were evaluated using GTEx (tissue type) and Blueprint (cell type), and dysregulation of gene-expression signatures were assessed following bone marrow transplantation and therapeutic treatment. In addition, we sequenced corresponding whole blood cells and buffy coat for comparison.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Plasma cf-mRNA profiling showed substantially higher proportion of transcripts from megakaryocyte and non-hematopoietic cells relative to whole blood cellular transcripts, suggesting that the molecular profile of cf-mRNA is more suitable for the assessment of gene-expression dysregulation of bone marrow than whole blood. We further report that non-invasive cf-mRNA profiling captures gene-expression alterations of cancer patients following chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. And we observed dysregulation of hematopoietic lineage-specific transcripts in circulation during bone marrow ablation and reconstitution. Lastly, we used cf-mRNA profiling to identify a malignant Ig clone for multiple myeloma patients and were able to monitor bone marrow reconstitution.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We demonstrated that cf-mRNA profiling is an effective means to non-invasively assess molecular characteristics that are associated with multiple clinical parameters of hematological malignancies.

The downstream metabolism of 5-ALA results in tumor-specific, highly selective accumulation of PpIX, an endogenous porphyrin, in tumor cells. We have previously reported evidence of PpIX in EVs derived from the plasma of glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Here, we characterize the tumor-specific nature of PpIX fluorescent EVs through quantification of their cargo, demonstrating their utility in the advancement of liquid biopsy for GBM diagnosis and management.<br \/>METHODS: Fluorescence activated cell sorting was adapted for nanoparticle isolation and PpIX fluorescent EVs were sorted from plasma collected from patients (N = 8) diagnosed with GBM, undergoing FGS. RNA cargo was extracted and quantified via low input RNA-Seq. Matching patient tumor and total plasma EVs along with healthy control plasma EVs (N = 8) were sequenced in parallel.<br \/>SUMMARY: Through sequencing analysis, we have demonstrated a distinct landscape of long RNAs (mRNA and lncRNA) in PpIX EVs, with isolation of this EV population resulting in an enrichment of lncRNAs. Considering the emerging diagnostic and prognostic potential of lncRNAs in GBM, exploration of such EVs provides valuable insight into the pathobiology of the tumor of origin. On a broader scale, gene expression analysis of PpIX EV cargo demonstrates at least a ten-fold enrichment of genes that are otherwise buried in the heterogeneous plasma EV background. Furthermore, downstream KEGG orthological analysis of PpIX EV cargo has revealed alignment of 78% of the significant pathways to processes implicated in cancer development and progression. We have identified a panel of genes unique to PpIX EVs, and reflective of the native tumor, that are implicated in GBM pathogenesis including GREM1, MAP4K4, and STAG2. Validation via quantitative and digital PCR of total plasma EVs from patient and healthy cohorts (N = 10, respectively) have yielded similar expression levels, as reflected in sequencing gene expression. Isolation of PpIX EVs, however, insinuates enriched genetic detection.<br \/>CONCLUSION: In summary, this preliminary cohort of GBM patients has demonstrated the utility of 5-ALA induced PpIX fluorescence outside of its original intentions: facilitating tumor-specific EV identification for the progression of liquid biopsy. These findings are an inviting breakthrough in the development of individualized disease detection and monitoring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dabc4609-39ac-4f68-a4db-3bafa63426a0\/@y03B8ZQM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Liquid biopsies,Extracellular vesicles,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18526"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"22552812-126b-4974-8257-4928c61fefe8","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/22552812-126b-4974-8257-4928c61fefe8\/@y03B8ZQM\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tiffaney Hsia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anudeep Yekula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Syeda M.

However, many patients are non-responders or develop resistance following an initial response to ICIs. ICIs have no accurate predictive biomarkers. Previously, we showed that increased expression of PD-L1 molecules on CD14+ monocytes was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) for patients with several cancer types on PD-1 blockade therapies. As monocytes can be further classified into subsets (classical, intermediate, non-classical), we herein investigated the prognostic factors in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets and assessed the clinical significance for the PD-L1-expressing subsets of each of these cells including classical, intermediate and non-classical monocyte subsets in patients with various cancer types, along with their clinical implications in PD-1 blockade therapies.<br \/><b>Material and Methods<\/b>: We evaluated 44 patients (20 with gastric cancer, 17 with non-small cell lung carcinoma, and 7 with esophageal cancer) undergoing PD-L1 blockade therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) for PD-L1 expression levels in classical (CD14high, CD16-), intermediate (CD14high, CD16+), and non-classical (CD14low, CD16+) monocytes measured via flow cytometry before ICI treatment. The percentages of PD-L1+ cells in respective monocyte subsets were compared with respect to different clinicopathological conditions and the association with survival time was assessed.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The number of PD-1 positive cells in CD14+ monocytes was very low (almost &#60;1%). Also, the monocyte subset expressing PD-L1 had a high percentage of classical monocytes, whereas non-classical monocytes expressed less PD-L1. Higher levels of classical monocytes were correlated with shorter OS (P = 0.044), whereas higher levels of non-classical monocytes were correlated with longer OS (P = 0.027). Focusing on non-small cell lung cancer population (N = 17), higher levels of PD-L1-expressing CD14+ monocytes were statistically correlated with shorter OS (P = 0.025). Furthermore, analysis of a subset of monocytes showed that the higher PD-L1-expressing classical monocytes correlated with the shorter OS, suggesting that they predict poor prognosis (P = 0.0095).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Circulating PD-L1-expressing classical monocytes in the peripheral bloods were associated with poor prognosis in patients treated with PD-1 blockade therapies.

Many studies have suggested that T cells against tumor neoantigens are critical mediators of response to checkpoint blockade. We showed previously that neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in cancer patients responding to anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab) therapy express high levels of CD57 and KLRG1. Here, we extended the study to bladder cancer patients treated with atezolizumab to identify predictive biomarkers of response. We immune profiled circulating CD8 T cells using multidimensional mass cytometry and single cell sequencing, and compared patients with objective response and progressive disease.<br \/>We found a higher frequency of CD57-expressing CD8 T cells at baseline in responding patients compared to patients who progressed during therapy (n=20, p&#60;0.01). High expression of CD57 was also observed in neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in responding patients. These findings were corroborated in a validation cohort (n=30, p&#60;0.01) and notably, higher frequency of CD57+ T cells was only observed in patients responding to atezolizumab and not in patients responding to chemotherapy treatment (n=40). We further used single-cell transcriptomics, together with CITE-seq and paired TCR sequencing, to characterize CD57+ CD8 T cells in a subset of patients (n=16) and identified a cluster within CD57+ CD8 T cells, which was characterized by enrichment of genes associated with activation, cytotoxicity and tissue resident memory markers in responding patients. Compared to patients with progressive disease, there was an increased clonal expansion among CD57+ CD8 T cells at baseline in responders, which was driven specifically by the activated cluster. Furthermore, we found increased overlap between TCR repertoires of tumor-infiltrating T cells and CD57+CD8 T cells, compared to CD57- CD8 T cells in the periphery, suggesting that levels of CD57+ CD8 T cells in the periphery could be indicative of quality of anti-tumor T cell response.This study identified and confirmed that elevated levels of circulating CD8 T cells expressing CD57 are associated with response to atezolizumab in bladder cancer patients. These data provide evidence and rationale for an easily accessible blood-based biomarker for selecting patients for atezolizumab therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/23f450c1-6bbf-4961-8d9a-a4b869d321ef\/@z03B8ZQN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,T cell,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19917"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mahesh Yadav<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Fehlings<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leesun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangnan Guan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kobe C.

Resection is the most widely used potentially curative treatment for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recurrence within 2&#8239;years occurs in 30-50% of patients and is a major cause of mortality. A biomarker to predict the risk of HCC and its recurrence is urgently needed. Our studies showed that hepatic levels of &#947;-OHPdG, an endogenous adduct from lipid peroxidation, closely correlate with hepatocarcinogenesis in various independent animal models, including an obesity model. Importantly, we observed that higher levels of &#947;-OHPdG in liver specimens from HCC patients who underwent surgical resection were strongly associated with poor survival (p &#60; 0.0001) as well as with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.007). These finding suggest that &#947;-OHPdG may serve as a prognostic biomarker of HCC and its recurrence. A non-invasive method to detect &#947;-OHPdG is highly desirable. There is a surge of interest in using circulating liver cells (CLCs) from patient blood to diagnose cancer stages and predict treatment outcomes, metastatic potential, and recurrence. We developed a non-invasive method for detecting and quantifying &#947;-OHPdG using CLCs from patient blood.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> The method was developed by following steps: (i) isolate CLCs from blood samples using a RosetteSep&#8482; Human CD45 Depletion Cocktail and Ficoll Paque, (ii) detect &#947;-OHPdG by immunocytochemistry, (iii) quantify the images of &#947;-OHPdG-positive stained CLCs, and (iv) compare with that found in liver biopsies by immunohistochemistry.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> To determine the specificity of the anti-&#947;-OHPdG antibody developed previously in our laboratory, we showed that the proportion of &#947;-OHPdG-positively stained cells and staining intensity increased in HepG2 liver cancer cells upon acrolein treatment. Liver cells were co-stained with asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGPR1), a cell surface protein expressed solely on the surface of hepatic cells. CLC &#947;-OHPdG was quantified using Metamorph (BioVision)-based journal software, developed to quantify the percentage of ASGPR1-stained cells that also stain positively, and with what level of intensity, for &#947;-OHPdG. We then applied this method to 35 HCC patients&#8217; blood samples. This method detects the number of ASGPR1 stained CLC and determines the cellular localization of &#947;-OHPdG, allowing the quantification of &#947;-OHPdG in these cells. While the nuclear &#947;-OHPdG reflects DNA damage, adducts in both the nucleus and the cytosol will be evaluated against IHC staining using biopsies and other clinical endpoints, such as disease stage and recurrence.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The CLC method descried above for detecting and quantifying &#947;-OHPdG can be potentially used to validate this adduct as a prognostic biomarker for predicting HCC risk and recurrence in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b4d4d124-77c3-42a1-8d8b-54232d497c7f\/@z03B8ZQN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Circulating tumor cells,DNA adducts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20480"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Monika Aggarwal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zizhao Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Gould<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samira Beheshtian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongbin Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhaskar Kallakury<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susette C.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the relationship between them and whether the immune TME can predict benefit from hypoxia-modifying therapy in the BCON trial that randomized MIBC patients to radiotherapy alone or with carbogen plus nicotinamide (CON).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tissue microarrays of diagnostic biopsies from 116 MIBC patients from the BCON trial were stained using Akoya Opal<sup>TM <\/sup>multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) reagents (CD8, CD4, FOXP3, CD68, PDL1, DAPI). Following multispectral scanning the slides were spectrally unmixed using Inform and marker proportion quantified using HALO software as the percentage of the total cell count per sample. Hypoxia was assessed as the presence of CA9 protein using IHC (n=111) and by using transcriptomic data (n=80) previously acquired to determine an hypoxia score (HS). Relationships with overall (OS) and local progression-free (LPFS) survival were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier curves in R. Molecular subtypes were determined using the consensusMIBC package in R.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Basal\/squamous and stroma-rich vs other molecular subtypes had increased hypoxia scores and immune markers (CD8, CD4, CD68, PDL1). Tumors with CA9 present had significantly lower proportion of CD8 T cells (p=0.027), and CD4 T cells (p=0.01) but there were no significant differences for other immune markers or significant differences associated with HS. Only CD8 showed a relationship with survival and we found the relationship between log(HR) and CD8 to be non-linear, which led to placing patients within groups. Patients with a low vs high proportion of CD8 T cells had a significantly worse 2-year OS (n=116, p=0.003) and LPFS (n=116, p=0.02). CD8 proportion was also prognostic in patients receiving radiotherapy alone for OS (n=61; p=0.003) and LPFS (n=61; p=0.003). Patients with low CD8 T cells had improved OS when CON was given with radiotherapy (n=87; p=0.05), but those with high CD8 T cells derived no benefit (n=27; p=0.95). Prognostic significance of low CD8 T cells in the whole cohort remained after adjusting for clinicopathologic variables and hypoxia measured using CA9 (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.18-0.57; p&#60;0.001) while hypoxia had borderline significance (HR=0.62; 95% CI 0.37-1.02; p=0.059).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Low proportion of CD8 T cells in the TME of MIBC patients has independent prognostic and predictive value.

Although SCLC is treated as a homogenous disease, recent studies revealed morphologic and transcriptomic heterogeneity with several molecular subtypes described based on predominant transcription factor expression (ASCL1, NEUROD1, ATOH1, POU2F3, YAP1) (Rudin et al., 2019; Simpson et al., 2020) which in preclinical studies exhibit differing vulnerabilities raising the potential of stratified therapy. DNA methylation is also thought be an important regulator of SCLC biology (Gazdar et al., 2017) and epigenetically distinct subtypes derived from SCLC primary tumour samples reported (Poirier et al., 2015). Here, we developed a robust workflow for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling to examine the potential use of cfDNA methylation profiling for detection and subtyping of SCLC.<br \/><b> <\/b><b> <\/b><b>Results: <\/b>To evaluate SCLC genome-wide DNA methylation patterns we employed a bisulfite-free enrichment-based approach (T7-MBD-seq). We tested this approach on tissue samples from preclinical models and from normal lung (n=110) and on cfDNA samples from both patients with SCLC and from non-cancer controls (n=157). Methylation profiles from preclinical models (patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and CTC derived explant (CDX) models) were comparable to previously described methylation patterns from SCLC primary tumours and were recapitulated in patients&#8217; cfDNA samples. A tumour\/normal classifier, based on 4,061 genomic regions detected as being hypermethylated in SCLC preclinical models, correctly assigned 93% and 100% cfDNA samples from patients with limited and extensive stage SCLC respectively, with a statistically significant correlation of prediction scores with disease stage (P=0.0076). Finally, to determine whether cfDNA methylation profiling could subtype SCLC patients, we built a subtype classifier, based on methylation signatures derived from 59 established SCLC cell lines. We applied the classifier to cfDNA samples from 56 patients and 10\/11 with known subtypes (identified from a donor matched CDX model) were correctly classified. Overall, 73% of cfDNA samples were classified as ASCL1, 13% were classified as NEUROD1 and 14% were classified as being double negative with the distribution of the subtypes correlating closely to previously published IHC data from SCLC tissue samples (Baine et al., 2020).<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our data reveal two potential clinical utilities of cfDNA methylation profiling; a universally applicable liquid biopsy approach for more sensitive detection and monitoring of SCLC and molecular subtyping to ease the path to future clinical trials of subtype stratified treatments for patients with SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Methylation,Circulating cell-free DNA,Subtyping,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20483"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dominic G.

Although an initial response is induced in approximately 50% of 5-Aza treated patients, subsequent relapse is almost certain. Recently, inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein family members have shown therapeutic potential in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and higher-risk MDS. Alvocidib (Alv), a CDK9 inhibitor and indirect transcriptional repressor of the anti-apoptotic factor MCL-1, has shown anti-leukemic effects in a phase 1 study of patients with AML (Lee DJ et al, Expert Opin Investig Drugs 2019; Zeidner JF et al, Leuk Res 2015). A phase 1b\/2 study with Alv and 5-Aza or decitabine in higher-risk patients with MDS was recently completed (NCT03593915); however, biomarkers for response to the Alv and 5-Aza combination are not well characterized. To identify potential biomarkers of response, we performed a comprehensive in vitro assessment of Alv and 5-Aza combination using a clinically well-characterized cohort of n=45 higher-risk patients with MDS and n=11 healthy controls (HC). CD34+ cells were purified from bone marrow (BM) aspirates using positive selection with MACS beads. CD34+ cells of HC were obtained from femur head replacement surgery bone specimens. After 4 days of expansion in SFEM II medium containing StemSpan Myeloid Expansion Supplement, cells were treated with 5-Aza for 48h, Alv for 24h or their combination (5-Aza for 48h followed by Alv for 24h). Cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo (CTG) and Annexin-V apoptosis assays. MCL-1 dependency of MDS samples was assessed using MS1 peptide-based assay. Recurrent myeloid neoplasia mutations in 67 genes were assessed in BM mononuclear cells using NGS panel deep sequencing. The combination of 5-Aza+Alv had an additive cytotoxic effect on CD34+ MDS cells in CTG assay (median cell viability = 74%, 73.8% and 55% for 5-Aza, Alv and combination respectively, p&#60;0.0001). In Annexin-V apoptosis assay, MDS samples were more sensitive to the combination treatment compared to HC (median % of apoptotic and dead cells = 36.6% for MDS vs 25.6% for HC, p=0.0288). MCL-1 dependency inversely and not significantly correlated with CD34+ cell viability in CTG assays (Spearman r=-0.37, p=0.1119). In contrast, we found significant associations between <i>ASXL1<\/i> and <i>ZRSR2<\/i> mutations and higher sensitivity of MDS samples to 5-Aza+Alv combination (p=0.008 and p=0.0005 in univariable analysis respectively). <i>ZRSR2<\/i> mutations also retained an independent impact on cell viability in multivariable analysis (p=0.035). Overall, we provide pre-clinical support for the use of 5-Aza+Alv combination for higher-risk MDS and identified <i>ASXL1<\/i> and <i>ZRSR2<\/i> mutations as potential genetic biomarkers of augmented response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b47da707-f519-4057-8e98-b98c04595640\/@z03B8ZQN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Bone marrow,Combination therapy,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20807"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"1453dafb-6ecf-4391-913d-435e42d29882","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1453dafb-6ecf-4391-913d-435e42d29882\/@z03B8ZQN\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vladimir Ryabov<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nanni Schmitt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingyu Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Streuer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johann-Christoph Jann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alina Wein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Altrock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Verena Nowak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadine Weimer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Obländer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Palme<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed Jawhar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Darwich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Wuchter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christel Weiss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georgia Metzgeroth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason M.

Our objective was to determine the effect of Sarcopenia on response to systemic therapy with advanced HCC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Patients with unresectable and advanced liver cancer were retrospectively evaluated between 2010 to 2019. Skeletal muscle area (SMA) was computed with a previously validated computed tomography (CT) body composition AI algorithm. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was derived from the skeletal muscle area (SMA) (cm<sup>2<\/sup>) divided by patient height (m<sup>2<\/sup>) calculated from images at the level of L3 on pretreatment CT. Sarcopenia cutoffs for females was less than 39 cm<sup>2<\/sup>\/m<sup>2 <\/sup>SMI or less than 50 cm<sup>2<\/sup>\/m<sup>2<\/sup> SMI for males. Patients&#8217; demographics, systemic treatment response, toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between first-line therapy groups. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression were used for survival analysis comparisons.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results: <\/b>A total of 146 patients with advanced HCC were assessed from Mayo Clinic Arizona and Emory University. Seventy-six patients received immunotherapy as first-line treatment and seventy patients received TKI as first-line therapy. Sarcopenia at baseline was assessed in a total of 91 patients at first-line systemic treatment: n=48 with immunotherapy (IO) and n=43 with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Sarcopenia was more prevalent in male patients (p=0.009), and in patients with low BMI (p=0.02). When comparing those with sarcopenia at baseline, higher response rate was observed in patients treated with IO without sarcopenia (47% versus 15%, p=0.019), this was not observed in TKI group. Interestingly, median PFS and OS was not significantly changed in patients with or without sarcopenia treated with IO or TKI on first-line therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Sarcopenia was associated with reduced response rate (RR) in patients treated with IO, but not in TKI groups. Both didn&#8217;t translate into deleterious effect in PFS and or OS.

Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 6(TRPV6) is upregulated in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. However, there is no report on expression and correlation between expression of the two markers. Since both markers are highly expressed in ovarian cancer, it is of great interest to evaluate expression of FR&#945; and TRPV6 in a panel of gynecological cancer, including those major subtypes.<br \/>Method:We have collected 200+ FFPE samples achieved in pathology core at National Clinical Research Center for Cancer\/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, including high grade and low grade serous ovarian cancer and clear cell ovarian cancer et al. Using validated IHC assays, expression of both FR&#945; and TRPV6 are evaluated.<br \/>Result:Various levels of FR&#945; and TRPV6 express in different histological subtypes of ovarian cancer. High grade serous ovarian cancer expresses the highest levels of FOLR1, which is about 2.8 and 2 folds over that of low-grade ovarian cancer and that of clear cancer ovarian cancer, respectively. The highest levels of TRPV6 expression are observed in clear cell ovarian cancer, which is 2.6 and 1.6 folds over that observed in low grade ovarian cancer and that observed in high grade ovarian cancer, respectively. The two biomarker expression is overlapped in about 45% of all samples analyzed. A comparison of samples from patients with or without good response to neoadjuvant therapy reveals samples with poor responses tend to express higher levels of FR&#945; than those with good responses do. Addition evaluation and analysis are still on-going.<br \/>Conclusion: FR&#945; and TRPV6 are highly express in gynecological cancer.

A two-tailed Fischer&#8217;s exact test was performed to compare genomic characteristics across arms.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In this study, 29 mRCC pts were randomized to receive N\/I +\/- CBM-588 and 21 (72%) pts (71% in N\/I with CBM-588 arm and 29% N\/I arm) had available genomic data. Within this cohort, the median age was 66.8 (range 46-90) and 71% of pts were male. Eleven (52.4%) pts had clear-cell histology and 10 (47.6%) pts had sarcomatoid features; 15 pts received N\/I with CBM-588 and 6 pts received N\/I alone. The most commonly mutated genes in the overall cohort were <i>VHL <\/i>(61.9%), <i>PBRM1 <\/i>(42.9%), and <i>SETD2 <\/i>(33.3%). Alterations in <i>VHL<\/i>, <i>PBRM1<\/i>, and <i>SETD2 <\/i>were seen in 66.7% vs. 73.3% (p=0.115), 50.0% vs. 40.0% (p=0.523) and 33.3% vs. 33.3% (p=0.686), in N\/I vs. N\/I with CBM-588 arm, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>There was no significant difference observed in clinically relevant genomic features across study arms. The clinical benefit from CBM-588 appears to be independent of tumor genomic characteristics.

There are shared risk factors between breast and ovarian cancer such as, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Detecting those risk factors are not enough to detect cancer early as approximately half of breast cancers develop in women who have no identifiable breast cancer risk factor other than gender (female) and age (over 40 years). Identification of specific biomarkers in liquid biopsies is required for early detection of BOC. BOC secretes exosomes in large quantities to blood circulation to communicate with different cell types such as immune cells to support cancer growth and metastasis. We detect a significant and readily measurable expression of a specific peptide from the a2 isoform vacuolar ATPase (a2NTD) in the exosomes isolated from the plasma collected from BOC patients. We found that a2NTD is highly expressed in stage III ovarian cancer. In this stage, the tumor spread outside of the abdomen and\/or nearby lymph nodes. a2NTD positively correlates with the CA125 levels in plasma. These data show that plasma a2NTD correlates with tumor cell growth and metastasis. In addition, a2NTD associated breast cancer exosome can contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease as it induces PBMCs to secrete cancer promoting factors such as IL-8, CCL-2, and MMP-9. Importantly, those secreted factors promote angiogenesis and tumor cell migration. a2NTD promotes the immunosuppressive properties of neutrophils by stimulating arginase-1 release. Together, this data shows that a2NTD can be a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in breast and ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/241b04b8-7b7c-4f03-abc2-84ddd5def742\/@z03B8ZQN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Exosomes,MMP9,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21141"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Safaa A.

One hypothesis is that diverse treatment response is governed by differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) both within the tumor and surrounding areas. Thus, novel ways to measure the heterogeneity within defined immune-cell populations is the key and now possible by using spatially-resolved multiplexed platforms. Here, we have investigated the phenotype of four T-cell subtypes both within and excluded from the tumor-rich regions in a large cohort of primary mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients. We propose that profiling different cell populations could potentially provide insight into patient prognosis and identify clinically actionable targets, but also in understanding whether tumor cells locally re-educate T-cells through cell-to-cell interaction or by soluble factors<br \/>Method: We analyzed archival FFPE presented as tissue microarrays of 196 cores from 104 MCL patients, collected from the Biobank of Lymphoma of Southern Sweden, by using the, GeoMX-digital spatial profiler (DSP, Nanostring Inc.). Cellular regions of interest were selected by immunofluorescense staining of CD8, CD3 and CD57 to identify four subpopulations of T cells - early cytotoxic (CD3+ CD8+ CD57-), early non-cytotoxic (CD3+ CD8- CD57-), late cytotoxic (CD3+ CD8+ CD57+) and late non-cytotoxic (CD3+ CD8- CD57+). 601 regions distributed among the four T-cell subtypes were collected from both within the tumor-rich and tumor deficient zones and probed for 69 proteins for sub-characterization.<br \/>Result: Our results show that the distribution and expression profile of all subpopulations differ considerably based on their position relative to the tumor. Using linear mixed effects model to account for effect of multiple sampling per patient, we observed higher cytolytic activity (upregulation of granzyme A and B) (FDR cut-off &#60; 0.05) in early cytotoxic and late non-cytotoxic cells, within the tumor-rich zone compared to the tumor-deficient area. In contrast, proteins such as STING, VISTA, neurofibromin and fibronectin were consecutively upregulated in all subtypes in tumor-deficient zones. We also observe differential expression profiles for proteins involved in for example cell death regulation and apoptotic signaling pathways. Our analysis provide insight into effector functions important for response to treatment in MCL.<br \/>Conclusion: This study reveals the phenotypic differences of T-cell subsets in MCL with a higher resolution compared to previous studies. The spatially-resolved analysis shows that the proximity to tumor cells highly affect the profile of different T-cell subsets and that further analysis of re-education mechanisms should be pursued. This study advance the understanding of the MCL tissue microenvironment and for the basis for connecting such differences to clinical outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a1a789b-ad15-4265-8c6f-f27a47bf3b6f\/@A03B8ZQP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mantle cell lymphoma,Biomarkers,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21354"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"9bae78ff-786c-4ee4-b970-47d91cabdad1","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9bae78ff-786c-4ee4-b970-47d91cabdad1\/@A03B8ZQP\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lavanya Lokhande<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joana De Matos Rodrigues<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Sandstrom Gerdtsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Porwit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mats Jerkeman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Ek<\/i><\/presenter>.

Elevated levels of metabolites of COX-derived, pro-inflammatory prostaglandin (PGs) metabolites in urine have been linked to increased risk of developing breast cancer (BC) in two large prospective cohorts. Further, CYP450-derived EETs in BC tumors are associated with metastasis. We hypothesize that measuring levels of AA-derived oxylipins in breast tissues could enable improved BC risk prediction, provide insights into pro-carcinogenic inflammatory mechanisms, and serve as potential surrogate endpoints in chemoprevention trials. Thus, we performed a pilot study to assess the feasibility of measuring these analytes in small breast tissue samples. We analyzed two sample sets, collected under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols: 50 normal breast tissue cores donated to the Komen Tissue Bank (KTB) via vacuum-assisted biopsy and 10 tissues removed surgically at Mayo Clinic beyond resection margins of lumpectomy samples performed for atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH). Tissues were frozen and maintained at -80<sup>o <\/sup>C. Normal KTB tissue cores were split in half. Tissues for analysis were weighed, extracted in cold methanol containing a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and assayed for a panel of 42 oxylipins using validated mass spectrometric methods with a limit of detection per analyte of 0.010 ng\/mL in supernatant and CVs of approximately <u>&#60;<\/u>11%. Analyte measurements in paired cores (ng\/g tissue) were compared with Spearman correlations and intra-class correlation coefficients. Measurements in surgical samples were assessed descriptively and levels were compared with normal KTB breast tissues.Median weight of the 50 split KTB cores was 0.055 grams. 17 oxylipins were detected in the tissue samples. PGD<sub>2<\/sub> demonstrated the weakest correlation between split cores (r=0.12; p=0.40), whereas 15-HETE demonstrated the strongest correlation (r=0.68; p&#60;0.0001). ICCs ranged from non-significant to nearly perfect, with highest values for 12-HETE (ICC=0.98, 95%CI: 0.97-0.99). Exploratory analyses of the KTB cores demonstrated significant associations between two BC risk factors, alcohol use and family history of breast\/ovarian cancer, and several analytes. Levels of most eicosanoids tested were substantially and highly significantly elevated in tissues surrounding ADH versus KTB normal breast tissues. We conclude that eicosanoids can be readily measured in small frozen breast tissue samples obtained via percutaneous biopsy or at surgery. Future studies to assess the associations of eicosanoid levels with BC risk factors and development of BC after a benign biopsy may inform risk prediction and potentially inhibitable inflammatory mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9e1a4270-66bb-4712-b168-5377c61b3f45\/@A03B8ZQP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Mass spectrometry,Lipid metabolism,Prostaglandin E2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21367"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ginger L.

Recently, the significance of exosomes as a biomarker has gradually increased; exosomes act as a critical mediator of cell-cell intracellular communication in cancer progression. In this study, we characterized exosomes derived from ascites (ExoAscites) of four patients with GC; the high concentration of ExoAscites was observed with the morphology of round-cup shape. Our results showed that ExoAscites were actively endocytosed into cancer spheroid with time. The tropism of ExoAscites showed a predominance to GC rather than stromal cells.Furthermore, their importance on cancer invasiveness and angiogenesis are verified in the 3D microfluidic cancer spheroid model. Interestingly, tumor progression was gradually promoted by treatment with increasing ExoAscites concentrations. Collectively, these results support the view that exosomes from ascites fluids act as mediators of the tumor microenvironment, thus providing conditions favorable for future tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc01fcc0-ccc5-4a67-b7a9-8ee1eeb9a942\/@A03B8ZQP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Biomarkers,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21451"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sujin Hyung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jihoon Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>In-kyung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noo Li Jeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeeyun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this study, we developed two independent models, GC (gross chromatin), and FEMS (fragment end motif frequency and size). Each model uses images generated from genome-wide normalized sequencing coverage and cf-DNA fragment end motif frequencies according to the different cf-DNA size profiles. Then we integrated them into a single ensemble model to improve cancer detection and multi-cancer type classification accuracy.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Low depth cf-WGS data was generated from 1,396 patients (stage I: 14.9%, stage II: 35.6%, stage III: 24.9%, stage IV: 24.2%, unknown: 0.4%) with breast (n=702), liver (n=213), esophageal (n=155), ovarian (n=151), pancreatic (n=85), lung (n=53), head and neck (n=16), biliary tract (n=15), and colon cancer (n=6) and 417 healthy individuals. Samples were randomly split into training, validation, and test set stratifying cancer type and stages. Cancer types with a small number of samples (&#60;20) were excluded for multi-cancer type classification. Each model was trained using a convolutional neural network, then integrated into a single ensemble model by averaging the predicted probabilities calculated from each model.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: For cancer detection, the ensemble model achieved sensitivities of 85.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 71.8% to 94.5%], 74.9% (CI: 68.0% to 88.0%), 73.2% (CI: 66.7% to 85.9%) at a specificity of 95%, 98% and 99% and the AUC value of 0.97(CI: 0.95-0.99) in the test dataset. By the cancer stages, sensitivity was 62.8% (CI: 48.8% to 83.7%) in stage I, 66.3% (CI: 57.7% to 82.7%) in stage II, 85.9% (CI: 77.5% to 94.4%) in stage III, and 76.1% (CI: 63.4% to 87.3%) in stage IV at 99% specificity. For multi-cancer classification, the overall accuracy of 85.1% (CI: 80.4% to 89.3%) was achieved including 6 cancer types.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Highly sensitive and accurate deep learning model for cancer detection and multi-cancer classification was generated by combining different types of cf-DNA features. This result provides the opportunity for general population multi-cancer screening using various cf-DNA features.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a69e203a-cfb3-4718-9ff6-7a09bd57e41f\/@A03B8ZQP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Deep learning,Liquid biopsies,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21490"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tae-Rim Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Mo Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joo Hyuk Sohn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sook Ryun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hwan Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gun Min Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ki-Byung Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunsung Jun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongryul Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong-Won Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph J Noh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Sik Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun-Young Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Myung Woo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Hyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eui Kyu Chie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun-Cheol Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youn Jin Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ki-Won Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong-Sik Byeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junnam Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dasom Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chang-Seok Ki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Eunhae Cho<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We evaluated whether ctDNA from pts enrolled in COLUMBUS Part 1 correlate with pts&#8217; efficacy outcomes.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In COLUMBUS Part 1, 577 pts were randomized 1:1:1 to enco + bini, enco, or vem. 650 plasma samples were collected at baseline (Cycle 0 or Cycle 1 Day 1; all arms) and during treatment (Cycle 2 Day 1 [C2D1]; enco + bini and enco arms); 426 samples from COLUMBUS Part 1 were successfully analyzed using the GuardantOMNI assay. Analyses were exploratory with no multiplicity adjustments.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Survival outcomes in the biomarker cohort were similar to those in the intent-to-treat population. ctDNA was detected in 279 (96%) pts at baseline and 107 (79%) pts at C2D1. 92% concordance was observed between two plasma genomics assays (Inostics and Guardant) and 75% between tumor and plasma with respect to <i>BRAF<\/i> mutation status. <i>BRAF <\/i>V600 variant allele frequency (VAF) at baseline was prognostic for PFS and OS (P&#60;0.0001) in the enco + bini arm. Treatment with enco + bini and enco sharply reduced <i>BRAF<\/i> V600 VAF (P&#60;0.0001). Decrease in <i>BRAF<\/i> V600 VAF was more pronounced in responders than in non-responders. Greater clinical benefit was observed in pts with complete ctDNA clearance at C2D1, among whom 12% and 58% had a complete or partial response, respectively, vs 9% and 48%, respectively, for those without complete ctDNA clearance. In the enco + bini arm, high tumor mutational burden (&#8805;10 per megabase) at C2D1, but not at baseline, was associated with shorter PFS (P&#60;0.0001) and OS (P=0.0151). The most frequently detected alterations at baseline were <i>BRAF<\/i> (79%), <i>TERT<\/i> (53%), <i>LRP1B<\/i> (21%), <i>TP53<\/i> (17%), and <i>PREX2<\/i> (14%). <i>BRAF<\/i> gene had the most significant decrease from baseline to C2D1 (51.6% difference; P&#60;0.0001), followed by <i>TERT<\/i> (41.6% difference; P&#60;0.0001), <i>GRIN2A<\/i> (16.3% difference; P=0.0152), and <i>ROS1<\/i> (12.2% difference; P=0.0437) in pts who received enco + bini. <i>FGFR1<\/i> mutations were found to be most associated with a lack of <i>BRAF<\/i> V600 clearance (P=0.0005). Further analyses of molecular correlates of response and resistance are underway.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These exploratory analyses of Part 1 of the COLUMBUS study suggested that treatment with enco + bini significantly reduced <i>BRAF<\/i> V600 VAF, which was prognostic for PFS and OS at both baseline and C2D1. ctDNA provides a powerful tool for understanding the molecular basis for response and resistance to treatment and may impact future treatment decisions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f8351171-45d2-4925-969d-75bb4eea007c\/@A03B8ZQP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,ctDNA,Prognostic markers,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21736"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Reinhard Dummer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nuzhat Pathan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhou Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Robert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Arance<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Willem B.

We previously reported that CD163+ M2 macrophages can inhibit ImmTAC-mediated T cell killing of tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and demonstrated that a low CD163:CD3 ratio in tumor biopsies was associated with better OS in a Phase 2 trial of tebentafusp in previously treated metastatic uveal melanoma (NCT02570308) [2]. Here we sought to confirm this finding using biopsies collected from the randomized Phase 3 trial (NCT03070392).<br \/>Methods: Previously untreated HLA-A*02:01+ mUM patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to either the tebentafusp or investigator&#8217;s choice arm. Tumor samples were obtained prior to dosing from both primary (eye) and metastatic (predominantly liver) tumors. Expression of CD3, CD8 and CD163 was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and digital image analysis enumerated immune cells per mm<sup>2<\/sup> (up to N=178 in the tebentafusp arm, N=81 in the control arm). A low quartile cut-off (low) vs &#8805; lower quartile (higher) was used for biomarker correlations with OS.<br \/>Results: Individually, the numbers of tumor infiltrating CD3+ or CD8+ T cells and CD163+ macrophages at baseline were not associated with better OS in either the tebentafusp or investigator&#8217;s choice arm.<br \/>Consistent with data reported from the previously treated tebentafusp trial, patients randomized to tebentafusp with low baseline CD163:CD3 ratio had improved OS compared to patients with higher ratio (HR=0.6, p=0.03; 1-year OS low=80% vs higher=65%). This association with OS was not as strong in the investigator&#8217;s choice arm (HR=0.7, p=0.3; 1-year OS low=52% vs higher=48%) in which the majority of patients were treated with pembrolizumab. Furthermore, tebentafusp showed superior OS compared to investigator&#8217;s choice in patients with low (HR=0.4, p=0.01) or higher (HR=0.5, p=0.001) CD163:CD3 ratio at baseline.<br \/>Discussion: In patients with previously untreated metastatic uveal melanoma, tebentafusp was superior to investigator&#8217;s choice regardless of the macrophage to T cell ratio in tumor biopsies. Low baseline macrophage to T cell ratio was more strongly associated with OS on the tebentafusp arm than investigator&#8217;s choice arm. These results demonstrate the importance of the tumor micro-environment in the anti-tumor response on tebentafusp in metastatic uveal melanoma.<br \/>Reference: 1.Nathan P., et al.

Here we report biomarker analysis of baseline tissue and blood TMB (tTMB and bTMB, respectively).<br \/>Methods: Patients with nsq-NSCLC were randomized 2:1 to TIS + platinum + pemetrexed or platinum + pemetrexed. TMB scores were evaluated on baseline tumor and blood samples by OncoScreen Plus&#174;. The Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation of tTMB with bTMB was assessed. PFS by independent review committee (primary endpoint) was assessed within subgroups defined by TMB status, using a Cox proportional hazard model with disease stage and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression as stratification factors. Interaction p-values &#60; 0.05 were considered statistically significant without multiplicity adjustment.<br \/>Results: Of 325 patients treated in RATIONALE-304, without an <i>EGFR<\/i> sensitizing mutation, 177 (54.5%) had evaluable tTMB and 107 (32.9%) had evaluable bTMB.

Here we report data from the final analysis of a Phase 1 trial that enrolled patients (pts) with various solid tumors treated with tislelizumab (NCT02407990). We evaluated the association of TMB with clinical outcomes, integrative biomarker analysis of genomic alterations and gene expression profiling by TMB status.<br \/>Methods:451 pts were enrolled and treated with different doses of tislelizumab. Baseline tumor tissue was evaluated for gene expression (HTG EdgeSeq Precision Immuno-Oncology Panel) and genomic profiling (FoundationOne CDx). TMB-H and gene hyperamplification (HA) were defined as &#8805; 10 mutations\/Mb and a minimum of copy number gain &#62; 5, respectively. Associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined using Cox proportional hazards models.<br \/>Results: The overall objective response rate was 13.3% (95% CI: 10.3, 16.8), median (m) PFS 2.1 months (95% CI: 2.1, 2.7), and mOS 10.3 months (95% CI: 8.5, 11.6). Improved clinical outcomes were observed in pts with TMB-H tumors (n=43, 16.2% of TMB evaluable pts), and response was further enriched in pts without gene HA (TMB-H\/HA-) (Table). This population showed elevated cytotoxic T-cell activity and interferon signaling in the TME, along with fewer hyper-amplified genes in RTK-RAS-PI3K pathway. This was validated in an independent PD-(L)1 inhibitor treated pan-cancer cohort (n=837): TMB-H\/HA-(n=139) had longer OS than TMB-H\/HA+ (n=89) (mOS: 34 vs 15 months, P=0.07). <table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{5FAF98EE-CDEB-463A-9EA2-A694D95C7921}\"><caption>Clinical outcomes in pts subgroups by TMB and HA status<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b>TMB-H<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b>TMB-L<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Overall<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HA-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HA+<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Overall<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HA-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HA+<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n (% in TMB BEP [N=266])<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">43 (16.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20 (7.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23 (8.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">223 (83.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">103 (38.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">120 (45.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR, % (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">32.6 (19.1, 48.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">50.0 (27.2, 72.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.4 (5.0, 38.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.3 (6.7, 15.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.7 (6.2, 19.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.2 (4.7, 15.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">mPFS, months (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.3 (2.0,11.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.1 (8.1, NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">(2.0, 1.2, 8.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.1 (2.0, 2.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.1 (2.1, 4.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.0 (2.0, 2.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">mOS, months (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20.1 (10.3, 37.4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30.9 (11.1, NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.7 (2.8, 23.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.1 (7.7, 11.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.9 (11.1, 18.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.7 (5.6, 8.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"7\"><i>BEP, biomarker evaluable population; CI, confidence interval; HA, hyperamplification; NR, not reached; ORR, objective response rate; mOS, median overall survival; mPFS, median progression-free survival; TMB-H, high tumor mutational burden; TMB-L, low tumor mutational burden<\/i><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>Conclusions: The combination of TMB and HA was found to be predictive of clinical benefit across various solid tumor types, treated with tislelizumab.

ABSK021 is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of CSF-1R that is currently under investigation in phase 1b clinical trials of cancer patients. However, it remains to be elucidated what population might be sensitive to CSF-1R inhibitor. Syngeneic mouse models with complete and functional immune system are important for the translation of preclinical immuno-oncology research into clinical settings. Here, we performed an efficacy screen in ten syngeneic models to evaluate the response to CSF-1R inhibition by ASBK021, and profiled the transcriptomic features by RNA-sequencing in each model. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies showed that four models were sensitive to CSF-1R inhibition (tumor growth inhibition value (TGI) &#8805; 35%) while six models were insensitive (TGI &#60; 35%). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the MHC class II genes were down-regulated and immune-related pathways had lower enrichment level in the sensitive models, when compared with insensitive models. Further, the result of <i>in silico<\/i> immune cell deconvolution by CIBERSORT indicated that the activated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells had significantly negative correlation with TGI in this screen.

Here, we report association between ICs and the clinical efficacy of tislelizumab (TIS), an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibody, by examining tumor tissues from various tumor types in three pooled Phase 1\/2 studies (NCT02407990, NCT04068519, NCT04004221).<br \/>Methods:Available baseline tumor tissues from patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors who received TIS were tested with either multiplex-immunohistochemistry (m-IHC) (n=67, Opal automation Multiplex IHC kit) or gene expression profile (n=629, HTG EdgeSeq Precision Immuno-Oncology Panel). High\/low cell density\/signature scores were defined per median score, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test was used to compare survival curves between pts with different biomarker levels.<br \/>Results: Pts with a high CD68 density (CD68<sup>Hi<\/sup>) (n=34) had a longer OS compared with pts who had a low CD68 density (n=33), with a median OS of 15.0 vs 10.4 months, p=0.11. A weak association was observed between survival and CD8 cell density. When the two cell types were combined as a composite biomarker, pts with high CD8 (CD8<sup>Hi<\/sup>) and CD68<sup>Hi<\/sup> showed the longest OS (Table). A consistent finding was confirmed in the gene expression population (Table). Further TME analysis revealed that pts with CD8<sup>Hi<\/sup> and CD68<sup>Hi<\/sup> signature showed most elevated CD8 T cell cytotoxicity (<i>CD8A, GNLY, GZMA, GZMB<\/i>), T cell trafficking (<i>CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL4, CCL5<\/i>), MHCI antigen presentation (<i>TAP1, TAP2, HLA.A\/B\/C<\/i>) signatures\/genes, and enriched expression of pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization pathway (<i>STAT1, SLAMF7\/8, ISG15<\/i>).<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{5C0B416A-D1DD-4787-9278-1FF97672DEB5}\"><caption>Association between ICs and the clinical efficacy of TIS<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;

Accordingly, CV risk assessment may help in identifying candidates for preventive cardioprotective treatment. Since existing CV risk scores may lack the sensitivity and granularity to reflect the changes in CV risk that is associated with early cancer, we hypothesized that a CV risk score based on aptamer-based proteomics would permit discrimination of CV risk between patients with early breast cancer and age-, sex- and risk factor-matched healthy subjects. Moreover, we hypothesized that CV risk as assessed by aptamer-based proteomics first increases during and subsequently decreases after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.<br \/>Methods: We included 120 women with early breast cancer participating in the 2x2 factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled Prevention of cardiac dysfunction during adjuvant breast cancer therapy (PRADA) trial who were assigned to candesartan vs placebo and metoprolol vs placebo. Blood samples were obtained serially at: Visit 1 (ie, post-surgery but prior to epirubicin), following the first cycle of epirubicin (Visit 2), after the completion of epirubicin therapy (Visit 3), following adjuvant therapy (Visit 4), and 1-2 years after completion of adjuvant and blinded therapy (Visit 5). Age-, sex-, and risk factor-matched subjects (n = 500) from the Fenland study served as controls. We used highly multiplexed modified aptamer-based proteomics to measure ~5000 plasma proteins. A validated 27-protein CV risk model (CVD) that provides information on absolute risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure or mortality over a 4-year period was used as the dependent variable.<br \/>Results: The CVD risk probability was significantly higher at Visit 1 than in the age-, sex- and risk-factor matched control group (p &#60; 0.001). The CVD risk probability increased significantly from baseline to completion of epirubicin therapy (p &#60; 0.001) and dropped below baseline levels for subsequent timepoints after the completion of epirubicin treatment. The mean CVD risk increased from 15.9% at Visit 2 to 24.6% at Visit 3, resulting in the percentage of subjects in the medium&#8208;high risk bin increasing from 9% at Visit 2 to 28% at Visit 3. The CVD risk distribution at the end of study was similar to the initial distribution at baseline and Visit 2.<br \/>Conclusion: Using a novel CVD risk proteomics model, we observed that (1) The CVD risk of patients with early breast cancer is increased compared to age-, sex- and risk factor-matched individuals from the general population; (2) CVD risk increases during adjuvant epirubicin-containing chemotherapy, and (3) after completed adjuvant cancer therapy CVD risk returns to pre-chemotherapy level. Use of the CVD risk score may represent a novel tool to identify and monitor cancer patients who may benefit from preventive cardioprotective therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4377c25c-2fe2-4fc3-9a79-3f91a9acc1b5\/@s03B8ZQQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cardiotoxicity,Biomarkers,Proteomics,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19970"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Torbjørn Omland<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Chadwick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ragnhild Røysland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geeta Gulati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Astling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siri L.

We analyzed 1081 primary melanoma samples and 358 metastatic melanoma samples and found that metastatic disease is enriched for amplifications in both MDM2 and MDM4 compared to primary disease, and these amplifications are associated with a lower probability of overall survival. Two additional negative regulators of TP53, namely USP7 and PPM1D, are enriched for alterations in metastatic melanoma compared to primary melanoma. MDM4 amplifications are associated with a higher rate of metastasis to the brain, liver, and lungs, while MDM2 amplifications are associated with a higher rate of metastasis to the brain, liver, and adrenal glands. These findings suggest that patients with metastatic melanoma show an enhanced dysregulation of the TP53 pathway compared to primary disease; though still under ongoing preclinical evaluation to assess therapeutic implications, we propose that patients with metastatic melanoma and TP53 wild-type status may be more likely to benefit from MDM2, MDM4, USP7, and PPM1D inhibitors, both alone and in combination, compared to those with primary disease. Additionally, we found that patients with MDM2 alterations were more likely to have a deep deletion in CDKN2A, alterations that are also associated with a higher rate of metastasis to the brain. We found that patients with a CDKN2A deep deletion had a statistically significant higher rate of alterations in TTN, MUC16, LRP1B, NF1, and SERPINB4, alterations that have all been previously associated with a favorable response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma. We therefore propose that CDKN2A deletion may serve as a biomarker to predict response to immunotherapy in melanoma. Moreover, given prior documented cases of patients diagnosed with both melanoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), we found that GBM displays the highest rate of deep deletions in CDKN2A (54.39%) across all cancer types screened. We analyzed 619 GBM samples and found that 9.16% display an MDM2 amplification and 9.52% display an MDM4 amplification. Given the genomic similarities between melanoma and glioblastoma, we suggest that patients with melanoma or GBM and amplifications in MDM2\/4 and CDKN2A deletions may need the development of combinations of targeted inhibitors of MDM2\/4, CDK&#8217;s and immunotherapy. We are currently pursuing these translational directions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/be93ea20-a3d9-4c47-bed4-5d26a903f392\/@s03B8ZQQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Glioblastoma multiforme,Mdmx,p16,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20003"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Taylor E.

Exosomes of liquid biopsy is rapidly introduced in clinical practice, providing possibilities to offer accurate information. We previously reported that tumor draining pulmonary vein blood (TDVP) derived exosomes were increased than the periphery, and GRIP and coiled-coil domain containing 2 (GCC2) in exosomes act as potential lung adenocarcinoma biomarkers. The purpose of this study to evaluate the diagnostic value of exosome enriched GCC2 in peripheral blood and TDPV in patients with lung cancer who underwent surgery.<br \/>Methods: The utilization of exosome GCC2 in the TDPV of lung cancer for clinically informative diagnosis was investigated using rabbit lung cancer model, healthy control rabbits, patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma, and healthy controls. Exosome GCC2 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to calculate the diagnostic efficiency of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), exosome CD63, plasma GCC2, and exosome GCC2.<br \/>Results: In the rabbit lung cancer model, the expression of exosome GCC2 from the TDPV significantly increased compared with that in the periphery, as determined by western blotting. Of the 70 patients included in the study, and the mean age of all patients was 65.8 &#177; 9.0 years. The AUC values of CEA according to the blood sampling sites were not significant (all p &#62; 0.05). By contrast, the AUC values of CD63 were 80.0% for TDPV (p &#60; 0.0001) and 55.0% for the periphery (p = 0.42), respectively. The AUC values of plasma GCC2 in the periphery and TDPV were 68.0% (p &#62; 0.05) and 74.0% (p &#60; 0.0001), respectively. Importantly, the diagnostic accuracy values of exosome GCC2 in the periphery and TDPV were 81.0% (p &#60; 0.0001) and 90.0% (p &#60; 0.0001), respectively. The increasing trend of exosome GCC2 in the TDPV had a significantly higher correlation with pathological stages than that of the periphery (periphery, p &#60; 0.05; TDPV, p &#60; 0.0001). Moreover, exosome GCC2 in the TDPV was associated with pathological stage (p &#60; 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p &#60; 0.01), and lymphatic invasion (p &#60; 0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: Exosome enriched GCC2 in the TDPV was significantly correlated with pathological stages and accurate AUL value than that in the periphery.

Despite an intensive mutational analysis, the mechanism of erythroid hyperplasia in AEL is still poorly understood and so are feasible therapeutic targets.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed a total of 124 adult AEL cases, where whole genome\/exome sequencing of 35 cases were followed by targeted-capture sequencing in all cases. RNA sequencing was also performed in 23 cases. The mutational profile of AEL cases were compared to that of 409 cases with non-erythroid AML (non-AEL).<br \/>Results: In accordance with a recent report, AEL cases were classified into 4 genomic groups (A-D), which are characterized by biallelic <i>TP53<\/i> mutations and complex karyotype (Group-A), mutated <i>NPM1<\/i> (Group-B) and <i>STAG2<\/i> (Group-C), and other mutations in histone modifiers<i> <\/i>and transcription factors (Group-D). In particular, all but one PEL cases belonged to Group-A. Also found in non-AEL cases, these group-defining lesions in AEL were uniquely associated with focal gains\/amplifications of <i>EPOR<\/i>, <i>JAK2<\/i>, and\/or <i>ERG\/ETS2<\/i> loci (Group-A), <i>PTPN11<\/i> mutations (Group-B), and <i>KMT2A<\/i>-PTD (Group-C), which might be responsible for the AEL phenotype. Highly enriched in PEL cases (7\/13), <i>EPOR<\/i>\/<i>JAK2<\/i> focal gains\/amplifications were implicated in their extreme erythroid hyperplasia and associated with particularly poor prognosis, even compared to other Group-A cases, who had shorter survival than those in other groups. As expected, <i>JAK2\/EPOR-<\/i>amplified cases showed upregulated STAT5 signaling compared to non-AEL cases, which however, was also observed in other AEL cases, suggesting that upregulated STAT5 signaling is a hallmark of AEL. Based on these findings, we tested the effect of JAK2 inhibition on cell growth and xenografts of <i>EPOR\/JAK2<\/i>-amplified AEL cells. Of interest<i>,<\/i> ruxolitinib-mediated JAK2 inhibition resulted in significantly suppressed in vitro cell growth of <i>EPOR\/JAK2<\/i>-amplified AEL cells and prolonged overall survival in 4 PDX models with phospho-STAT5 downregulation, although other 2 models were resistant to JAK2 inhibition with persistent STAT5 activation.<br \/>Conclusion: AEL is a heterogenous subgroups of AML characterized in common by upregulated JAK\/STAT5 signaling. Gains\/amplifications of <i>JAK2<\/i>\/<i>EPOR<\/i> are frequent in <i>TP53<\/i>-mutated cases, particularly those with the PEL phenotype, and could be exploited as potential therapeutic targets using JAK2 inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/452f105c-e333-43fc-a752-f4903f09d888\/@s03B8ZQQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,JAK,TP53,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20381"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>June Takeda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenichi Yoshida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masahiro M.

Approximately 20% and 17% of patients undergoing BRAF targeted therapy develop resistance associated with copy number increases in either BRAF or cylinD1 (CCND1), respectively. Detection of BRAF or CCND1 copy number gains prior to radiographic tumor progression could potentially prompt a therapeutic switch aimed at treating patients with smaller tumors burdens, which may improve survival. Conventional droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for copy number analysis uses two probes, one target and one reference gene (2-plex). To improve the accuracy and sensitivity of the copy number analysis and account for possible genetic alterations in the reference gene, we performed a 5-probe multiplex (5-plex) reaction using three reference genes and two targets.<br \/>Methods: We used cell lines with known copy number gains for the BRAF gene (M395-R) and CCND1 gene (SkMel-187) to identify copy number increases using ddPCR. To estimate the limit of detection of the copy number gains in plasma, high and low concentrations of the cell line DNAs were spiked into healthy plasma and divided into three replicate samples of 3ml each. DNA was extracted from plasma using the Circulating DSP NA Kit (Qiagen). The ddPCR reaction mix used 4X Supermix and five different copy number specific probes targeting: two genes of interest, BRAF (7q34) and CCND1 (11q13.3); and three control genes: FOXI3 (2p11.2), AGO1 (1p34.3) and TTC5 (14q11.2). Each probe was titrated to display a unique cluster location on the 2D plot. Probe concentrations were: BRAF: FAM 2X; CCND1: FAM 1X; FOXI3: HEX 2X; AGO1: HEX 1X; TTC5: FAM 0.7X\/HEX 0.4X. Each extraction was divided into 4 replicate wells. Following droplet generation, gene copies were analyzed using the QX Manager 1.2 Standard Edition for advanced analysis.<br \/>Results: Probe titration resulted in 32 quantifiably distinct ddPCR clusters on a single 2D plot. Copies\/ul of the reference genes were used as a benchmark for diploid status. We determined that the M395-R cell line had 45 copies of the BRAF gene and that SKMel-187 had eight copies of the CCND1 gene compared to diploid PBMC DNA (Promega). Based on the spike-in experiments, we estimate that we can detect copy number gains in plasmas with 10% or 20% tumor fraction when tumor cells have approximately 45 or 8 copies of the target gene, respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: We successfully multiplexed five copy number assays in a single ddPCR reaction, and showed that copy number changes could be identifiable with as little as 10% tumor fraction within plasma when the tumor-associated copy number gains were relatively high. Overall, the 5-plex assay has the potential to be excellent tool for copy number detection in blood, and can be customized as needed for other targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/508fcf46-7464-4241-8069-3e5a55c977f1\/@s03B8ZQQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Copy number alterations,ctDNA,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21752"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer M.
