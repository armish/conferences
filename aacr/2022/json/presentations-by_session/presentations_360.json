[{"Abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease with a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes, from indolent resectable disease to aggressive-metastatic cases. Primary and acquired resistance limits the efficacy of available treatments, and the identification of effective drug combinations is needed to further improve patients' outcomes. We previously found that the NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor pevonedistat induced tumor stabilization in preclinical models of poorly differentiated, clinically aggressive CRC resistant to available therapies. To identify drugs that can be effectively combined with pevonedistat, we performed a \"drop-out\" loss-of-function synthetic lethality screening with an shRNA library covering 200 drug-target genes in four different CRC cell lines. Multiple screening hits were found to be involved in the EGFR signaling pathway, suggesting that, rather than inhibition of a specific gene, interference with the EGFR pathway at any level could be effectively leveraged for combination therapies based on pevonedistat. Exploiting both BRAF-mutant and RAS\/RAF wild-type CRC models, we validated the therapeutic relevance of our findings by showing that combined blockade of NEDD8 and EGFR pathways led to increased growth arrest and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Pathway modulation analysis showed that compensatory feedback loops induced by single treatments were blunted by the combinations. Our results suggested possible therapeutic opportunities in specific CRC clinical settings. We further focused on HER2 amplified CRC cells and we observed cooperation between pevonedistat and HER2\/EGFR blockade by the trastuzumab + lapatinib combination -the current standard treatment for HER2-amplified CRC. In addition, to confirm cooperation in reducing colony formation in vitro, we explored the effect of pevonedistat on long-term persisters, i.e., cell surviving to several weeks of HER2\/EGFR blockade. Interestingly, we observed a marked decrease of cell colonies when pevonedistat was added to persisters survived to three weeks of trastuzumab + lapatinib treatment. These results unveil the possibility of testing in vivo the addition of pevonedistat subsequently to tumor stabilization or reduction by HER2\/EGFR blockade, to promote further tumor regression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8cb0051b-ec76-4b83-a6fd-eead6753c750\/@z03B8ZEy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,HER2,Nedd8,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16052"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Federica Invrea<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Carugo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabrina Arena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Bardelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giulio F.

Several EGFR inhibitors are used to treat EGFR-positive colorectal cancer (CRC). Unfortunately, primary and acquired resistance to the inhibitors is very common. Current approaches to combating the resistance include combining EGFR inhibitors with agent(s) that targets compensatory signaling molecules (HER2, HER3, IGF1R, MET, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA). However, responses to such combination treatments are modest, if any. Overcoming drug resistance remains a major unmet medical need in EGFR-positive CRC.<br \/>Results: Here, we show the main reason for CRC resistance to EGFR inhibitors and a therapeutic strategy that overcomes it. The sensitivity of CRC cells to EGFR inhibitors correlates with EGFR downregulation. PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup>, a recombinant human protein that induces the degradation of both EGFR and HER2, strongly inhibits oncogenic signaling and growth of CRC in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous tumors, orthotopic tumors, and patient-derived xenografts), regardless of activating mutations of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. siRNA knockdown of EGFR or HER2 also inhibits CRC cells resistant to EGFR inhibitors. PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup> indirectly suppresses HER3, IGF1R and MET by disrupting their heterodimerization with EGFR or HER2. While excessive tumor-generated EGFR ligands may block target engagement by PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup>, inhibiting ligand shedding by aderbasib enables PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup> to exert strong antitumor activity, and fluorouracil further enhances tumor inhibition. Collectively, our study shows that CRC resistance to EGFR inhibitors result primarily from their inability to eliminate their target and a PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup>-centered combination treatment overcomes the resistance.<br \/>Conclusions &#38; Therapeutic Relevance: The therapeutic activity of PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup> highlights that EGFR and HER2 remain indispensable to the survival of CRC cells resistant to EGFR inhibitors. The strong therapeutic activity of PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup>-centered combination treatment in preclinical models of CRC, which carry clinically relevant gene mutations that confer resistance to current EGFR inhibitors, provides the scientific premise for potential evaluation of this recombinant human protein in patients with drug-resistant CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/168f4adf-84be-45af-a9f9-6a18965ec087\/@z03B8ZEy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Drug resistance,EGFR,ErbB2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16053"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lu Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arup Bhattacharya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Sexton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Ling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fengzhi Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuesheng Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

We previously reported that colorectal cancer (CRC) cells exposed to targeted therapies activate an adaptive mutability stress response, involving DNA damage induction and a switch to low-fidelity DNA replication. Therefore, targeted treatment might lead to increased mutation rate in DTPs, but mutation rates of cancer cells during treatment have not been quantitatively assessed. Here, we combined biological experiments and mathematical modelling to characterize emergence and dynamics of DTPs. From this, we extrapolated parameters governing dynamics of cancer cells populations and designed a modified Luria-Delbr&#252;ck assay on mammalian cells (MC-LD) to quantify mutations rates of CRC cells under standard growth conditions and during exposure to targeted therapy. We selected mismatch repair proficient CRC cell lines sensitive to different clinically used therapeutic agents, and derived clones to be used for experiments. By monitoring cell dynamics in drug-response growth assays, we found that CRC cells exposed to targeted therapy display a biphasic killing curve reaching a stable plateau, a pattern indicative of emergence of DTPs. By fitting model estimation to population growth assays, we predicted that, even if a subgroup of DTPs predated treatment, the majority of them emerged only upon exposure to targeted therapies. We also observed that DTPs slowly replicate under treatment, as shown by Carboxy fluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) analysis and staining with 5-ethynyl-2&#8217;-deoxyuridine (EdU). We used these population dynamics parameters to design the MC-LD assay. CRC clones were plated in several 96-multiwell plates each, and after an expansion phase in standard culture conditions, treatment was added. After 3-4 weeks, a minority of wells showed growth of resistant colonies: based on the measured growth rates, we could predict that the resistant cells arose before treatment by spontaneous mutation. The remaining wells contained a homogenous population of DTPs. After several weeks of treatment, when pre-treatment resistant clones would have already emerged, late-emerging resistant colonies appeared in a subset of wells in which DTPs had previously been detected. Using the number of residual DTPs and resistant colonies to infer mutation rates, we found a 7- to 50-fold increase (depending on the cell line) in DTPs&#8217; mutation rate compared to sensitive cells.In conclusion, we developed a new assay which allows quantitative comparisons of spontaneous and drug-induced mutation rates in cancer cells and showed that adaptive mutability in DTPs leads to increased mutation rates. This approach could be used to measure whether and how a wide range of environmental conditions affect DTP phenotype and mutation rates in mammalian cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/448a98d4-d58c-48ee-b326-d4c144bae286\/@z03B8ZEy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Targeted therapy,Modeling,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16054"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alberto Sogari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariangela Russo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Pompei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mattia Corigliano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Crisafulli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Bertotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Gherardi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Di Nicolantonio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Bardelli<\/i><\/presenter>.

While multimodality treatment strategies for curative treatment of esophageal cancer, including the CROSS regimen (chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery) have increased median overall survival, the majority of patients develop recurrences after several months. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been recently shown by our group to be one of the major underlying mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Paradoxically, therapeutic pressure of effective therapies such as the CROSS regimen are found to instruct a mesenchymal, resistant phenotype in models for EAC. In this study, the aim was to delineate the heterogeneity for the propensity to undergo EMT after chemoradiation and which mechanisms underpin this propensity.<br \/><i>Methods: <\/i>A panel of 8 EAC cell lines (5 primary and 3 ATCC cell lines) were treated with chemoradiotherapy and ranked by their propensity to undergo EMT, based on morphology when EMT occurred and protein marker expression. Next, the cell line panel as well as 44 pre-treated esophageal biopsies were RNA-sequenced. Expression data of the cell line panel were linked to their ranked <i>in vitro<\/i> EMT response. By means of Leave-one-out cross validation with Ridge Regression, EMT score prediction in pre-treated biopsies was validated. Gene expression profiles were related to clinical outcome data to identify markers that associated with propensity for EMT in patients.<br \/><i>Results: <\/i>In the panel of in vitro EAC models, a strong heterogeneity was observed for the propensity to EMT after chemoradiation. For each marker, Ridge regression analysis identified the top 50 highly correlating genes. Combining all positively correlating genes of days to EMT, NCAD and ZEB1, known key transcription factors of pluripotency including NANOG and OCT4 emerged. Expression of NANOG and OCT4 in pre-treatment biopsies was highly predictive for response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation, occurrence of recurrences, and survival in patients. Genetic perturbation by knockout and inhibition of NANOG and OCT4 reduced the onset of EMT and sensitized cells for chemoradiation.<br \/><i>Conclusions: <\/i>In conclusion, we were able to identify patients who are disproportionally prone to develop EMT in response to chemoradiation. Moreover, stemness factors NANOG and OCT4 are crucial regulators in plasticity of EAC and are promising predictive markers in pre-treatment biopsies of patients. By targeting NANOG and OCT4 <i>in vitro,<\/i> cells were sensitized to chemoradiation, holding promise for stemness inhibition to prevent therapy resistance in EAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8becd837-2955-4a7e-9d76-07c27a394d01\/@z03B8ZEy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Resistance,Adenocarcinoma,Predictive,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16058"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amber Perenna Van der Zalm<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark P.

These numbers point towards an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches wherein therapy resistance poses a tremendous challenge. We and others have identified the role of growth hormone (GH) and its cognate receptor (GHR), overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients (PDAC; &#62;90% of pancreatic cancer cases), in driving therapy resistance by directly upregulating multidrug efflux, phenotype switch via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibition of apoptosis. Our laboratory had pioneered the discovery of pharmacologic GHR antagonists including the only approved and prescribed GHR antagonist, pegvisomant, and a new antagonist candidate named compound-G. Here, we used in vitro, in vivo and in silico analyses to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a treatment regimen including GHR antagonist and chemotherapy to manage PDAC. Both pegvisomant and compound-G exhibit significant suppression of cancer cellular viability, invasive potential, drug efflux rate and apoptosis in PDAC cell cultures. In male and female Nude mice with human PDAC xenografts, GHR inhibition by either pegvisomant or compound-G markedly re-sensitized the tumors towards both low and high doses of gemcitabine treatment. Compound G plus high doses of gemcitabine lead to almost complete tumor clearance in 40% of the mice. Also, tissue analyses reveal increased production of GH in tumors treated with chemotherapy. In the GHR antagonist treated tumors, significantly lower expression of ABC transporter (Abcb1, Abcg5, Abcc2, Abcg2), EMT mediator (Cdh2, Zeb1, Snai2, Epas1) and apoptosis marker (Bcl2) genes compared to control were observed - accounting for the observed sensitization to gemcitabine. In the human PDAC patient datasets, increased expression of GHR correlates strongly with increased expression of multidrug efflux transporters, anti-apoptotic markers, and EMT transcription factors. Therefore, we provide robust pre-clinical validation for a treatment regimen combining GHR antagonist and chemotherapy leading to highly efficacious tumor clearance.<br \/>Acknowledgement: This work was supported in part by the State of Ohio&#8217;s Eminent Scholar Program that includes a gift from Milton and Lawrence Goll, by the AMVETS, and Ohio University&#8217;s Student Enhancement Award and Edison Biotechnology Institute.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6037a26d-2a8d-4748-a7dd-c2506d6ec22f\/@A03B8ZEz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Gemcitabine,Growth factor,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16115"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Reetobrata Basu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prateek Kulkarni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Davis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvana Duran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John J.

The goal for this study is to understand whether a GHR antagonist (GHA) could suppress different types of cancers by sensitizing tumors to drug treatments in vivo through the downregulation of ABC transporters. Sera from GHA transgenic mice inhibited the proliferation of mouse melanoma cells (B16F10) in culture and suppressed expression of multiple ABC transporters. When B16-F10 cells were intradermally inoculated into GHA mice, tumor size was markedly reduced, as was STAT5 activation and ABCG1, ABCG2 levels. We then tested the effect of the GHA on the efficacy of cisplatin in vivo. GHA sensitized melanomas to cisplatin, leading to the smallest tumors among all groups. GHKO mice showed the same effect. We further extended this investigation to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). GHA mice were subcutaneously inoculated with mouse HCC (Hepa1 6 cells) and subsequently treated with sorafenib. The HCC tumors in GHA mice were markedly sensitive to sorafenib treatment compared to the same in wild-type mice. RNA analysis showed that when HCC was exposed to the combined treatment, relatively decreased ABC transporters expression was found. Immunohistochemical staining showed that phosphorylation of STAT5 and ABCB1 were downregulated in HCC tissues, suggesting that GHA in vivo downregulates ABC transporters in HCC, and therefore sensitizes them to sorafenib. Clinical data derived from HCC patients using the TCGA database showed that multiple ABC transporters in both types of cancer correlate with GHR levels; that is, when GHR levels are relatively high, patient survival is significantly decreased. Additionally, higher ABCC1 levels also lead to significantly decreased survival rate in HCC patients. Collectively, the results indicate that a GHA is effective in sensitizing both melanoma and HCC to available treatments in vivo and may be used as a therapeutic strategy for higher efficacy of tumor clearance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9f48b1f5-8a45-4aa4-8c7f-ef06f1d6176a\/@A03B8ZEz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Growth factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16116"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yanrong Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Reetobrata Basu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Mathes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prateek Kulkarni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Davis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Darlene Berryman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edward List<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvana Duran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John J.

Recently, we reported the discovery of a novel truncated variant of the microtubule plus-end binding protein CLIP-170, hereafter CLIP-170S, whose expression is enriched in taxane resistant cell lines and patients with GC. Mass-spec proteomics and 5&#8217;-RACE further showed that CLIP-170S lacked the first 155 amino acids, including the Cap-Gly motif required for microtubule plus-end localization. CLIP-170S knockdown reversed taxane resistance in cells and xenografts, whereas its re-expression led to resistance, suggesting causation. Unlike canonical CLIP-170, we showed that CLIP-170S was mislocalized from the MT plus-end to the MT lattice. Computational analysis of RNA-seq data in conjunction with the connectivity map from taxane-sensitive and resistant GC cell lines, predicted imatinib as the top candidate drug to overcome drug resistance. Imatinib treatment completely reversed taxane resistance, as predicted, and did so unexpectedly by selective depletion of CLIP-170S. Other RTK inhibitors also depleted CLIP-170S, suggesting a class effect. We are currently unraveling the molecular mechanisms by which a) CLIP-170S impairs taxane association to its microtubule binding site and b) Imatinib and other RTK inhibitors selectively deplete CLIP-170S. Our data show that CLIP-170S is a clinically prevalent variant that confers taxane resistance in tumors, whereas the discovery of Imatinib as a CLIP-170S inhibitor provides novel therapeutic opportunities for future trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2ac04e54-787d-460a-9b28-2dac795871b5\/@A03B8ZEz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Taxane,Microtubules,Imatinib,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16118"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Prashant V.

The low survival rate is due largely to advanced stage upon diagnosis. Improved treatment options remain essential in combating the disease and bolstering patient outcomes. Nanoparticle albumin-&#173;bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is a chemotherapeutic receiving attention for its potential in EAC treatment. The taxane has exhibited greater specificity for targeting cancer cells while decreasing cytotoxic effects to adjacent healthy populations. Unfortunately, chemoresistance remains an issue surrounding adequate treatment regimes. Epinephrine and its receptor, &#946;2 adrenergic, have been shown to dysregulate various oncogenic pathways and reduce chemotherapeutics efficacy. Typically associated with pain management and addiction treatment, Methadone hydrochloride has been investigated for its potential to block the oncogenic effects of epinephrine and strengthen the impact of chemotherapeutics. In this study, we evaluated the enhancement of apoptosis by combination of nab-paclitaxel and methadone, and we demonstrated the ability of methadone to block epinephrine-induced chemoresistance.<br \/>Method: We utilized PCR to elucidate EAC cell lines with the greatest expression of Mu opioid and &#946;2 adrenergic receptors. Next, we investigated adequate dosages of methadone and epinephrine for the EAC cell lines by WST-1 assay. WST-1 assays were also utilized to determine cell growth under co-administration of nab-paclitaxel and methadone as well as methadone and epinephrine. Propidium iodine cell viability flow cytometry assay was used to detect cell death. Annexin V staining was utilized to further distinguish between apoptotic and necroptotic cells.<br \/>Result: OE19 and OE33 cell lines showed increased expression of Mu and &#946;2 adrenergic receptors, ensuring the cells were capable of binding to methadone or epinephrine. WST-1 assays established 100 nM of epinephrine and 200 nM of methadone as optimal dosages for both cell lines. Our previous studies demonstrated that about 5.85 uM of nab-paclitaxel (5ug\/mL) induces apoptosis in OE19 and OE33. Propidium iodide staining showed the enhancement of cell death under combination treatment of nab-paclitaxel and methadone. Annexin V staining confirmed that the effect was via apoptosis.<br \/>Conclusion: The current study demonstrated methadone&#8217;s ability to block epinephrine-induced cell proliferation and showed an enhanced effect on apoptosis when combining nab-paclitaxel with methadone in EAC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fa44af4c-42a6-4361-ad32-7b8d349470e0\/@A03B8ZEz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Drug resistance,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16139"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicholas Cwidak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sazzad Hassan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chloe Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saisantosh Ponna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niranjan Awasthi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Urs Von Holzen<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is hypothesized that the poor response of MSI-high esophagogastric adenocarcinomas to therapies is due to the extensive genomic mutational heterogeneity, which can be overcome by identifying, stratifying, and targeting multiple genetic alterations concurrently. The goals of this project are to: 1) Identify a matched retrospective cohort of 20 MSI-high to 20 microsatellite stable organoids, derived from biobanked tumor tissue. 2) Analyze mismatch repair protein function\/loss, to confirm that the primary tumor microsatellite status is recapitulated in 3D organoid models. 3) Test standard of care chemotherapies, and explore alternative approaches to prevent chemoresistance by evaluating targeted agents based on genomic sequencing.<br \/>Methods: Patient-derived organoids grow for ~14 days, after which they are enzymatically disrupted and plated in Matrigel. I will confirm that the organoid models accurately represent clinal response, by treating them with the same chemotherapy received by the patient. 10 different drug concentrations are added in triplicate using a drug dispenser, then after 72 hours, organoid viability is determined with a plate reader.<br \/>Results: Genomic characterization of 13\/226 MSI-high cases has been conducted with a 234 gene gastric cancer specific panel to identify and target genomic alterations. Preliminary robotic drug screens guided by these mutation profiles have been conducted, yielding promising alternative treatments.<br \/>Conclusions: By targeting the particular mutations found in MSI-high patients, it could help explain the chemoresistance mechanism, so promising personalized treatment approaches for esophagogastric adenocarcinomas can be clinically implemented.<br \/>Sources of Funding: This project is funded by the Inez and Willena Beaton Award in Oncology, valued at $7,500 and provided by the RI-MUHC.

Loss of the tumor suppressor SMAD4 is associated with 18q21 chromosomal deletion and frequently observed in pancreatic and colon cancers. The large-scale cancer dependency Broad and Sanger lethality screens revealed a synthetic lethal relationship between genomic loss of SMAD4 and vacuolar protein sorting 4 homolog A (VPS4A) with selectivity in pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines. VPS4A is a functional paralog to vacuolar protein sorting 4 homolog B (VPS4B), where VPS4B is located on 18q21 and correlates with SMAD4 copy number. VPS4A and VPS4B are paralog ATPases that function in the endosomal sorting complex required for vesicular transport and budding, which is required for cellular homeostasis and survival. As a consequence, collateral loss of VPS4B associated with SMAD4 loss results in a selective sensitivity for VPS4A deletion. Therefore, VPS4A is a possible therapeutic target in tumors deficient for VPS4B.We investigated the paralog synthetic lethality relationship between VPS4A and VPS4B in pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines. We rescued cell growth using ectopic wildtype VPS4A expression following combined knockdown of VPS4A and VPS4B. We further investigated if the ATPase activity of VPS4A was required to rescue paralog lethality using ectopic expression of mutant catalytically-dead VPS4A proteins. We discovered that the ATPase activity of VPS4A was required to rescue paralog lethality, as expression of the catalytically-dead VPS4A proteins did not support cell growth. However, it was noted that expression of the mutant proteins resulted in cell growth attenuation in addition to the inability to rescue. To investigate this observation, we expressed mutant and wild-type VPS4A proteins in cell lines without knock-down of endogenous protein. We found expressing either of the mutant VPS4A proteins, but not wild-type VPS4A protein, decreased cell growth in the presence of the endogenous protein. Decreased cell growth with the expression of the ATPase catalytic mutants suggest a potential dominant negative effect. This negative effect on cell growth with an ATPase inactive protein has the potential to translate to the effect observed with a selective VPS4A ATPase inhibitor. Additionally, the discovery of a selective ATPase inhibitor against VPS4A or VPS4B may be challenging due to the high sequence similarity within the ATPase domain. However, the microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain between VPS4A and VPS4B shows less sequence similarity and has a higher likelihood for selectivity. In summary, we confirmed the paralog lethality relationship between VPS4A and VPS4B and the dependence on the ATPase activity of VPS4A. However, the selective targeting of the VPS4A ATPase activity may result in unintended cell growth impairment, the lack of synthetic lethality, and potential for adverse toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cb89eaf9-e3e9-4fe4-9927-06509affa2b9\/@A03B8ZEz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Tumor suppressor gene,Pancreatic cancer,Colon cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16159"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy Nacarelli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nelisa Bechtel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanzhe Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kurt Auger<\/i><\/presenter>.

Sorafenib has been used as a systemic therapy for HCC for &#62;10 years but patients frequently develop resistance with oncogenic c-MYC (MYC) identified as a correlating prognostic factor. MYC over-expression is associated with aggressive disease in up to ~70% of HCC. While MYC represents an attractive therapeutic target, it has historically been considered undruggable, largely because it lacks a structured binding pocket and its expression is tightly autoregulated. The MYC gene and its regulatory elements are part of an insulated genomic domain (IGD), a chromatin looping region anchored by CTCF. Here we describe our approach to specifically modulate levels of MYC expression by utilizing targeted mRNA-encoded proteins, Omega Epigenomic Controllers (OECs), to mediate epigenetic regulation while potentially overcoming MYC autoregulation. For screening, putative OECs were directed to 2 loci on the MYC IGD. Identified target loci were used to design optimized OECs, including development candidate OTX-2002.<br \/>We characterized OTX-2002 in HCC cell lines, measuring MYC mRNA and cell viability. OTX-2002 was tested for durable epigenetic and transcriptomic changes. Changes in MYC protein levels and pathway signaling were measured using proteomic methods. Finally, we analyzed activity of OTX-2002 in <i>in vivo<\/i> subcutaneous (subQ) and orthotopic HCC models by assessing tumor volume, tumor-associated bioluminescence (BLI) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).<br \/>OTX-2002 was effective at decreasing MYC<i> <\/i>mRNA, protein and cell viability in HCC cells while sparing normal cells. In HCC cells, OTX-2002 median EC<sub>50<\/sub> of inhibition is &#60;0.001 ng\/mL for MYC mRNA and 120 ng\/mL for cell viability. Importantly, the effects of OTX-2002 persisted for &#62;2 weeks, providing durable MYC mRNA repression. IV delivery of OTX-2002 in lipid nanoparticles at 3 and 6 mg\/kg Q5D in a Hep 3B subQ model in athymic nude mice demonstrated statistically significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 54% and 63%, respectively, by Day 23 compared to negative control. OTX-2002-treated mice did not have a significant decrease in bodyweight (BW) compared to negative control or sorafenib-treated mice. IHC of OTX-2002 and control treated tumors showed significant down-regulation of MYC with reduced proliferation (Ki67) and increased apoptosis (Caspase 3). In a Hep 3B orthotopic model 3 mg\/kg OTX-2002 Q5D showed a comparable reduction of BLI to sorafenib at 50 mg\/kg QD without the reduction in BW.<br \/>Our findings identify a therapeutic <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> approach that enables transcriptional modulation of the MYC oncogene through precise epigenomic programming of the IGD in which it resides. Targeting MYC in this manner may represent a potentially differentiated and viable approach to the treatment of HCC in humans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30b02dd4-7819-44ce-b32e-af39dab672ab\/@A03B8ZEz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Epigenomics,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16160"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>William Senapedis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elmer Figueroa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kayleigh Gallagher<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremiah Farelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Lyng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles O'Donnell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Newman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas McCauley<\/i><\/presenter>.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and their stemness are critical for metastases formation associated with poor survival rates. In colorectal cancer (CRC), several stem-cell markers, such as CD44v9 and LGR5, the positive cells cause intertumoral heterogeneity and promote refractory potential. However, the mastermind of the cells which is critical for the treatment resistance remains unknown.<i> <\/i>Here, we aimed to identify the mechanisms of the treatment resistance of the CRC by focusing on typical stem cells. We selected several stem cell-related genes such as pluripotency related genes, based on the expression profile analysis of CRC patients along with drug susceptibility assays using patient-derived organoids. Despite the small number of cancer stem cells, the single cell produced heterogeneous cell populations <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> in vivo<\/i>, expressing various differentiation and stem biomarkers, and confirmed by the knockdown analysis. Single-cell trajectory analysis suggested that heterogeneous populations including cancer stem and some persister cells were derived from the stem cells following administration of anti-cancer drugs. Furthermore, the stem cells formed heterogeneous liver metastases at a high rate, and these unique cells were observed in the bloodstream of CRC patients. This present study unveils a mechanism of CRC treatment resistance and highlights the potential of stem marker-expressing cells as CTCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b66cad75-a073-4999-bf29-fe86be2e0218\/@A03B8ZEz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Drug resistance,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20546"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Norikatsu Miyoshi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiki Fujino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Sekido<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tsuyoshi Hata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takayuki Ogino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hidekazu Takahashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mamoru Uemura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>HIrofumi Yamamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuichiro Doki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hidetoshi Eguchi<\/i><\/presenter>.
