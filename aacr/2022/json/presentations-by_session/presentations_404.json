[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Ewing Sarcoma (EWS) is the second most common malignant bone tumor of children and adolescents. Patients with metastatic or recurrent disease have very poor outcomes. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) has been implicated in EWS tumorigenesis and development of metastatic disease, with anti-IGF1R antibodies and kinase inhibitors in clinical studies. However, with only ~10% of patients achieving objective responses, delineation of novel pathways that facilitate IGF1R-driven oncogenesis in EWS could provide avenues for more effective therapy. Intracellular trafficking plays a central role in regulating RTK expression and signaling, and this pathway is frequently deregulated in cancer cells. The EPS15 homology domain-containing (EHD) proteins regulate intracellular traffic of cell surface receptors, including RTKs. We observed high frequency (67%) of EHD1 overexpression in 266 primary EWS patient tumor tissues and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of publicly available mRNA expression data showed that high EHD1 expression was associated with shorter patient survival.<br \/><b>Objective: <\/b>This study aims to comprehend the underlying role of EHD1 in EWS oncogenesis.<br \/><b>Study design: <\/b>Three EHD1-expressing EWS cell lines, TC71, SKES1, and A673, were engineered with doxycycline-inducible EHD1 shRNAs to assess the impact of EHD1 knockdown (KD) on <i>in vitro<\/i> oncogenic properties. Stable EHD1-Crispr-KO and mouse EHD1-rescue TC71 and A673 cell line models were developed and characterized. Further, non-targeting control or EHD1-KD TC71 cells engineered with RFP-luciferase reporter were implanted in the tibia of nude mice in an orthotopic xenograft model and tumor growth was monitored by IVIS imaging.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> EHD1-KD led to a significant impairment of EWS cell proliferation, migration, invasion, soft-agar colony formation, and tumor-sphere formation in vitro and reduced tumor growth in nude mice. Using a phospho-RTK profiling antibody array, we found reduced phospho-IGF1R levels upon EHD1-KD, identifying IGF1R as a potential target of regulation by EHD1. Western blotting showed a reduction in total IGF1R levels, and flow cytometric and immunofluorescence analyses revealed a pronounced decrease in the cell surface IGF1R levels upon EHD1 KD\/KO in EWS cell lines. EHD1-KO EWS cell lines also exhibited a defect in IGF1-dependent migration and proliferation, and the phenotypes were restored by mouse EHD1 rescue. IGF1R and EHD1 were found to colocalize intracellularly and to co-immunoprecipitate after IGF1 stimulation. Finally, EHD1 depletion was found to impair the IGF-1R-mediated activation of downstream AKT and MAPK pathways.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our studies indicate a novel requirement of the intracellular traffic regulator EHD1 in sustaining IGF1R mediated oncogenesis in EWS. Future studies will aim to evaluate dual targeting of EHD1 and IGF1R in EWS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/539740cd-ba25-45f6-badc-4e0314c21441\/@w03B8ZHB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),Ewing sarcoma,Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor,Malignant progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13073"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sukanya Chakraborty<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhopal C.

ATAD3A is identified as a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme that regulates mitochondrial dynamics, cholesterol metabolism, and signal transduction. However, its impact and underlying regulatory mechanisms in cancers remain to be determined. We report here that ATAD3A is highly expressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where it plays a critical role in favoring tumor progression. Loss of ATAD3A expression dramatically incudes tumor regression in orthotopic tongue tumor-bearing mice, whereas gain of ATAD3A expression produces the opposite effects. Mechanistically, ATAD3A binds to ERK1\/2 at HNSCC cell mitochondria in the presence of VDAC1, and this interaction is essential for the activation of mitochondrial ERK1\/2 signaling. Most importantly, the ATAD3A-ERK1\/2 signaling axis enhances HNSCC development in a Ras-independent manner and, thus, tumor suppression is more effectively achieved when ATAD3A and Ras signaling pathways are co-inhibited. These novel findings highlight the importance of activation of ATAD3A-ERK1\/2 axis in cancer progression and suggest that combined targeting of ATAD3A and Ras signaling could potentiate anticancer activity for HNSCC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d67f3cc0-401d-4a07-89d8-25b5cf8a17ea\/@x03B8ZHC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,ERK,Ras,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13074"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Liwei Lang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reid Loveless<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaohui Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chloe Shay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yong Teng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

To address the opposing roles of miR-3622 family members in various human prostate cancer cell lines, we knocked out endogenous miR-3622, including both miR-3622a\/b.

Whilst MAPK mutations can be found in roughly 30% of human cancers<sup> <\/sup>(Schubbert et al. 2007) including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), genomic and proteomic analyses have indicated suppression of MAPK pathway activity in SCLC<sup> <\/sup>(Cerami et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2013). Previous attempts to determine whether this might be therapeutically important<sup> <\/sup>(Ravi et al, 1998; Cristea et al. 2016\/2020) have had conflicting conclusions. SCLC has recently been defined by the relative expression of four major transcriptional regulators (<i>ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, YAP1<\/i>)<sup> <\/sup>(Rudin et al., 2019). In this study we aimed to elucidate the effect of MAPK activation in these different SCLC subtypes and explore its therapeutic vulnerability.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> <i>ASCL1-, NEUROD1- and POU2F3-<\/i> driven SCLC cell lines were transduced with a doxycycline-inducible vector for expression of MEKDD<sup>S217D\/S221D <\/sup>(MEK1). Activation through MEK1<sup> <\/sup>in <i>ASCL1<\/i>-driven SCLC cell lines resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth over 9 days. This was associated with G2 cell-cycle arrest and senescence. Expression of MEK1<sup> <\/sup>in the cells of other SCLC subtypes and NSCLC failed to show any appreciable changes in cell growth. Remarkably, athymic mice injected with a MEK1 expressing <i>ASCL1<\/i>-driven cell line showed significantly slower tumor formation and longer survival than when MEK1 was not expressed. Notably, we observed the opposite when MEK1 expressing <i>NEUROD1<\/i>-driven cells were injected into athymic mice. We observed strong upregulation of negative feedback regulators DUSP6 and SPRY2 upon MAPK activation which has previously been described in solid tumors and pre-B ALL (Courtois-Cox et al 2006; Shojaee et al. 2015). Interestingly, phosphokinase array demonstrated that, almost exclusively, STAT3 through phosphorylation at S727 was strongly upregulated in the <i>ASCL1<\/i>-driven subtype after MEK1 expression. This prompted us to look at other regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway and found an increase in phosphorylation of the inhibitory phosphatase PTPN6 (SHP1) in the <i>ASCL1-<\/i>driven subtype and no STAT5 phosphorylation in any of the subtypes. We next examined whether these cells were sensitive to STAT3 inhibition. Upon treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor, stattic, <i>ASCL1<\/i>-driven SCLC cells reached their IC50 after 3-5 days in comparison to 9 days for other SCLC subtypes. MEK inhibition through PD0325901 rescued growth inhibition upon MAPK activation and was further associated with a decrease in DUSP6, SPRY2 and pS727 STAT3. JAK1\/2 inhibition through ruxolitinib had no effect on cell viability.<br \/><b>Summary<\/b> These findings suggest that <i>ASCL1<\/i>-driven SCLC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> is sensitive to activation of MAPK signaling.

As insufficient vasculature in the tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to nutrient deficiency, cellular responses to nutrient deprivation is relevant to consider in the treatment of solid tumors. Here, we demonstrate that levels of pRb, pERK, and pAKT after cell synchronization via nutrient deprivation and after release via serum stimulation vary unexpectedly across a panel of nine cancer and two normal cell lines. From these results, we describe a novel classification of tumor cells defined by their behavior in nutrient-limiting conditions. Four colorectal, four lung, and one breast cancer cell line, and two normal lung fibroblasts were included in the panel. A range of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations as well as wild-type cells were represented. In 6-well plates, 1E5-5E5 cells were plated per well in media containing 10% serum, incubated for 16-24 hours, then were nutrient-deprived in media containing 0% or 1% serum for 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours. Synchronization was released by serum stimulation with 20% serum-containing media for 24-48 hours. Cells were imaged, counted, and harvested, then protein levels of Rb, pRb, ERK, pERK, AKT, and pAKT were measured in cell lysates using a western blot. Nutrient deprivation slowed the proliferation of each cell line. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of Rb at Ser795 and Ser807\/811 after nutrient deprivation varied across cell lines. pRb remained at baseline in MCF7 cells, decreased in RKO and H1299 cells, and increased in HCT116 cells. Despite this, levels of the pRb upstream regulator CDK6 decreased consistently across these cell lines, suggesting possible alternate regulation of pRb in MCF7 and HCT116 cells. Unanticipated variation in pERK levels after nutrient deprivation was also observed, including a dramatic increase in pERK upon starvation in HCT116 cells but not in others. Similar notable findings were made as far as pAKT. pAKT levels changed dynamically across time points in some cell lines, but consistently increased in some (MCF7) and decreased in others (RKO). Cell synchronization release via serum stimulation caused varying levels of pRb and pERK restoration. Our novel findings reveal a broad new classification of tumor cells defined by their behavior nutrient-limiting conditions. Such classification may guide the use of nutrient deprivation as a predictive biomarker for CDK, MEK, or mTOR inhibitors in solid tumors with nutrient-poor TMEs, as we are currently exploring. We are also evaluating the impact of nutrient deprivation on immune cell killing and cytokine secretion of specific classes of cancer cells that we define here, and are working to establish real-time cell cycle markers to visualize differential effects of serum deprivation and stimulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb348444-7ada-4bd8-89cc-4418eb9b9a28\/@x03B8ZHC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Akt,Retinoblastoma protein,ERK,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13077"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lindsey Carlsen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wafik S.

The majority (90%) of breast cancer-related deaths are due to distant metastases. HER2-enriched breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have the highest propensity to metastasize and have limited to no treatment options. Metastatic HER2-enriched breast cancer and TNBC patients commonly develop therapeutic resistance and, therefore, lack efficacious therapies. Due to dismal prognoses in metastatic HER2-enriched breast cancer and TNBC patients, there remains an urgent need to identify novel molecular pathways for actionable therapeutic targets. Truncated glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (tGLI1), an alternatively spliced variant of GLI1, is a gain-of-function tumor-specific terminal effector in the Hedgehog pathway. tGLI1 promotes breast cancer growth and circulating tumor cells to the brain. More recently, our lab has reported tGLI1 physically interacts with Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3); tGLI1 and STAT3 are co-overexpressed in node-positive HER2-enriched and triple-negative breast carcinomas. The Interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling axis is a primary regulator of STAT3 and is frequently dysregulated and hyperactivated in multiple cancers, including breast cancer. IL-6 functions through a hexameric receptor complex comprised of IL-6 receptor &#945; (IL-6R) and glycoprotein 130 (GP130) to recruit Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK). In turn, JAKs phosphorylate STAT3 resulting in homodimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity. Independently, tGLI1 and IL-6\/IL-6R\/GP130\/STAT3 pathways have been previously investigated as mediators for breast cancer metastases; however, whether they cooperate to promote breast cancer progression remains unknown. Herein, we report tGLI1 and IL-6\/IL-6R\/GP130\/STAT3 pathways to be frequently co-expressed and co-activated in HER2-enriched breast cancer and TNBC tumors and that the co-activation is associated with a shortened metastasis-free survival (MFS). Additionally, when stratified by metastatic site, breast tumors with high tGLI1 and IL-6\/IL-6R\/GP130\/STAT3 co-activation are associated with a worse bone, brain, and lung MFS compared to tumors with low co-activation. Ectopic co-overexpression of tGLI1 and GP130 upregulates mRNA expression of stemness genes, <i>Nanog<\/i>, <i>Sox2<\/i>, and <i>Oct4,<\/i> leading to the subsequent promotion of the breast cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation <i>in vitro<\/i>. Taken together, our findings revealed a novel crosstalk between tGLI1 and the IL-6\/IL-6R\/GP130\/STAT3 signaling axis to enhance the CSC subpopulation, suggesting the importance of the crosstalk in mediating metastasis of HER2-enriched breast cancer and TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e727f3b3-fa94-480b-99d4-32f2fcac622e\/@x03B8ZHC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,tGLI1,Interleukin-6,STAT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13078"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara G.

Previously, we found that <i>MSLN<\/i> KO PDAC cells grow in culture and as subcutaneous tumors similarly to wild-type (WT) cells but form intraperitoneal metastases poorly. MSLN pre-cursor (pre-MSLN) is a 71-kD glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that is cleaved intracellularly to make the 31-kD secreted protein Megakaryocyte Potentiating Factor (MPF), and a 40-kD mature MSLN (mMSLN) that retains membrane attachment. The mMSLN can be shed from the cell surface by the action of specific proteases, resulting in release of soluble MSLN (sMSLN) to both the tumor microenvironment and serum. The goal of this study is to see if sMSLN promotes cancer cell aggressiveness. We transduced <i>MSLN<\/i> KO pancreas cancer cells to express: 1) a mutant, secreted-only pre-MSLN (includes WT MPF) with a C-terminal truncation (MSLN&#916;599) that prevents GPI-linkage of MSLN to the membrane, and 2) truncated pre-MSLN consisting of MPF only. Results show that complementation of KO cells with MPF or MSLN&#916;599 does not rescue the <i>MSLN<\/i> KO phenotype, while MSLN&#916;599 bearing a Y318A point mutation that disrupts the binding of MSLN to MUC16\/CA125 does restore growth of peritoneal metastasis. We performed RNA-deep sequencing on <i>MSLN<\/i> KO cells exposed to WT or Y318A sMSLN from conditioned medium. We identified 2000 genes that were differentially expressed across the treatment groups. Exposure to sMSLN resulted in changes in expression of cell adhesion and sterol biosynthetic synthesis pathway genes. Individual genes that were top hits were also identified and are under investigation. Exposure to sMSLN changes the transcriptomic program of pancreas cancer cells and may promote peritoneal colonization.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49d4ae93-dd11-442b-9315-3f424bae045f\/@x03B8ZHC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Mesothelin,Mouse models,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13079"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Theressa Ewa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leela Avula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Joseph<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Rudloff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha Sevilla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vishal Koparde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xianyu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Alewine<\/i><\/presenter>.

PRMT5 uses adaptor proteins for substrate recruitment through a previously undefined mechanism. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved peptide sequence shared among the three known substrate adaptors (CLNS1A, RIOK1, and COPR5) and show that it is necessary and sufficient for interaction with PRMT5. We demonstrate that PRMT5 uses modular adaptor proteins containing a common binding motif for substrate recruitment, comparable with other enzyme classes such as kinases and E3 ligases. We structurally resolve the interface with PRMT5 and show via genetic perturbation that it is required for methylation of adaptor-recruited substrates including the spliceosome, histones, and ribosomal complexes. Furthermore, disruption of this site affects Sm spliceosome activity, leading to intron retention. Genetic disruption of the PRMT5-substrate adaptor interface impairs growth of MTAP-null tumor cells and is thus a site for development of therapeutic inhibitors of PRMT5. Current efforts are focused on understanding whether PRMT5-substrate adaptor disruption synergizes with immune therapies or new classes of PRMT5 inhibitors in CDKN2A\/MTAP null cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f47852fa-af47-462b-bf9e-b26b49d6991b\/@x03B8ZHC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p16,Pancreatic cancer,Spliceosome,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13080"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kathleen M.

Although new therapies have improved outcomes in advanced RCC, most patients eventually fail treatment and succumb to this devastating disease. Systemic therapy strategies have focused on TKI and immunotherapy, alone or in combination. Triptolide, a diterpenoid epoxide extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f (TWHf), has potent antitumor activity in multiple cancer models. Few studies have focused on the potential of triptolide as a novel therapeutic option in RCC.<br \/>Objective: the objectives of this study are to characterize the in vitro and in vivo effects of Triptolide (T) and its water-soluble form, Minnelide (M), in models of renal cell carcinoma.<br \/>Methods: The in vitro effects of triptolide (T) on human and murine RCC (786-0, A498, Caki-1, ACHN, and RENCA) cell proliferation was assessed using cell count and xCelligence assays at 24, 48, 72 and 96h. Molecular and mechanistic characterization of triptolide&#8217;s effects in 786-0 cells were analyzed by the (Reverse Phase Protein Array) and validated by western blot analysis. The in vivo effects (tumor progression and survival) of M were assessed in nude mice bearing 786-0 tumors (8x10<sup>6 <\/sup>cells per mouse). M was administered to tumor-bearing mice at two different doses (0.21mg\/kg and 0.42mg\/kg daily), intraperitoneally, for 21 days. Correlative studies to explain the in vivo effect of M and the correlation with the molecular changes in vitro seen are being performed and will be shown in the poster.<br \/>Results: T significantly inhibited, in a dose-response manner, cell proliferation in all human and murine renal cancer cell lines, with IC50 ranging between 12.5 and 25 nM). T was associated with significant negative modulation of proliferation, cell cycle, survival, increased apoptosis, and ER stress pathways in 786-0 cells, as demonstrated by RPPA analysis and validated by western Blot of selected pathway proteins, such as apoptosis (PARP cleavage and Caspase 3 activation), ER stress induction (pEIF2a, CHOP), and down-regulation of survival and proliferation pathways (pAKT). In vivo, M was associated with significant antitumor effects in 786-0 xenografts, with complete responses in the majority of mice while on treatment. These effects were associated with significant prolongation in overall survival in M treated vs. control mice. No significant toxicity or treatment-related deaths were observed.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results have shown for the first time the potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of T in RCC and the molecular changes associated with these effects. The profound antitumor effects in the aggressive 786-0 RCC xenograft model are highly encouraging and warrant further preclinical studies and potential clinical trials of M this devastating disease. Correlative tumor studies to understand the mechanisms of M in vivo antitumor effects are underway and will be presented at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0ea16db-0856-41a2-aa93-18db07afeec2\/@x03B8ZHC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell growth,Cell death,Endoplasmic reticulum stress,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13081"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Valery A.

Oncolytic viruses (OVs) represent novel cancer biotherapies, and among them, the oncolytic measles virus (MV) has demonstrated safety and antitumor activity in early clinical studies. MV alone does is not associated with cancer cures. Triptolide, a diterpenoid epoxide extracted from the thunder god vine (Tripterygium wilfordii), has been reported to have potent antitumor effects via multiple mechanisms, including anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, antiangiogenic, and induction of ER stress. The effects of triptolide on viral colon cancer oncolysis have not been previously investigated.<br \/>Objectives: To characterize the in vitro and in vivo mechanisms of novel stromal retargeted oncolytic MVs and improve efficacy by combining MVs with triptolide.<br \/>Methods: The in vitro effects of triptolide alone, MV-GFP (Edmonston strain of Measles virus expressing eGFP, for human cancer cells), MV-m-uPA (MV retargeted against the murine uPA receptor, for murine cancer cells), or virus-triptolide combinations on tumor cell cytotoxicity were assessed by cell count (Vi cell counter) or xCelligence assays, on HT-29, HCT116, SW620, CT26, and MC38 cells. Molecular and mechanistic characterization of Triptolide&#8217;s effects alone and combination with MV in HT29 cells will be analyzed by the (Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) and validated by western blot analysis (experiment undergoing). In vivo effects (tumor progression and survival) of minnelide (M) (water-soluble version of Triptolide) alone and in combination with Measles Virus were assessed in Balb\/C mice bearing CT26.<br \/>Results: While MV and T had dose-dependent cytotoxic activity as single agents, significant augmentation of MV oncolysis was induced by co-treatment with triptolide. In vivo experiments showed similar effects observed in vitro, with potent antitumor activity of triptolide and enhanced in vivo antitumor activity when minnelide was combined with MV vectors.<br \/>Conclusions: our results strongly suggest that triptolide or minnelide enhances measles virus oncolysis in vitro and in vivo models of colorectal cancer.

The limited availability of therapeutic options for mesothelioma patients suggests the need for a better understanding of mesothelioma biology and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Progranulin is a pluripotent growth factor whose dysregulation is implicated in several human pathologies including cancer. The pro-tumorigenic activity of progranulin depends on the activation of its functional receptor EphA2. Indeed, in bladder cancer, progranulin promotes EphA2 phosphorylation at Ser897 and triggers EphA2 oncogenic action resulting in increased tumor cell migration, invasion and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth. Both progranulin and EphA2 are expressed in mesothelioma, with progranulin promoting tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner and EphA2 being often mutated or overexpressed. However, in mesothelioma, the potential functional interaction between progranulin and EphA2 is unexplored. Using a panel of mesothelioma cell lines covering all mesothelioma subtypes, we observed increased levels of phosphorylated EphA2 at Ser897 when compared to immortalized normal mesothelial cells, and the levels of phosphorylation positively correlated with progranulin expression. Progranulin-dependent activation of EphA2 in mesothelioma cells promoted the activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways and ERK1\/2-dependent EphA2 phosphorylation at Ser897. Transient depletion of progranulin by siRNA approaches as well as <i>GRN<\/i> gene knock-out by CRISP\/Cas9 strategies in mesothelioma cells reduced the activation of the AKT signaling pathway and inhibited the migratory and invasive capabilities of progranulin-depleted cells when compared to parental cells, suggesting that the progranulin\/EphA2 axis is oncogenic in mesothelioma. However, EphA2 genetic ablation resulted in an increased basal activation of AKT and MAPK and in progranulin-evoked EphA2-independet AKT\/MAPK activation, indicating that alternative membrane receptors might compensate for EphA2 loss and sustain progranulin action in mesothelioma. Using several pharmacological and genetic approaches, we uncovered a role for EGFR and FAK in compensating for EphA2 loss by triggering progranulin-dependent oncogenic signaling in mesothelioma, highlighting a complex functional cross-talk between EphA2, EGFR and FAK in mediating progranulin-dependent tumorigenesis. Thus, these results suggest the need for combinatorial therapeutic approaches to blunt progranulin oncogenic action in mesothelioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/65b4e314-60aa-4b0b-94b3-49ce40be6cc0\/@y03B8ZHD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Progranulin,EphA2,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13082"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elisa Ventura<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Buraschi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen J.

However, BRAFi monotherapies are associated with a significant risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development in melanoma patients. Consequently, BRAF inhibition results in an unanticipated activation of the MAPK pathway in surrounding cells that harbour wildtype BRAF. Fortunately, a combination approach with both a BRAFi and the selective MAPK inhibitor (MEKi), trametinib, attenuates BRAFi-induced risk of SCCs. Despite the fact that this combination therapy is widely used in clinical practice, the mechanisms associated with SCC induction and why this effect is attenuated with a MEK inhibitor remain poorly understood. HORMAD1, a meiosis specific gene, has been shown to have an impact on genomic instability and proliferation in the development of SCCs. Moreover, recent work in our lab has demonstrated that the MAPK pathway regulates HORMAD1 expression in SCC cell lines. Therefore, we sought to investigate a potential role of HORMAD1 in the risk and development of SCCs as a mechanism of BRAFi that is attenuated with the co-administration of the MEKi, trametinib. Using the BRAFi, vemurafenib, we inhibited the kinase activity of activated BRAF (V600E) and the MEKi, trametinib to evaluate the expression of HORMAD1 in melanoma and normal keratinocyte cell lines. To determine the effects of these two inhibitors, a cell proliferation assay was conducted followed by the evaluation of various components of cell cycle regulation and genomic instability. We found that HORMAD1 protein expression levels increased following treatment with the BRAFi, vemurafenib, in the normal keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, but not in the melanoma cell line, A375. In contrast, HORMAD1 expression decreased following treatment with the MEKi, trametinib in both HaCaT and A375. Cell proliferation assays depict a vulnerability to both vemurafenib and trametinib in both normal and melanoma cell lines, however, HaCaT cells appear to be more susceptible to increased levels of genomic instability following treatment with vemurafenib when compared to A375. Our results suggest that HORMAD1 likely plays a key role in the development of SCCs by increasing genomic instability and proliferation in normal keratinocytes following BRAFi monotreatment. The increased risk of SCC formation is attenuated by dampening HORMAD1 levels with the co-administration of the MEKi, trametinib.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ba4b144-dc65-4eaa-a581-2af886918eef\/@y03B8ZHD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skin carcinogenesis,MEK inhibitor,BRAF,DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13083"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer Gantchev<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amelia Martinez Villarreal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon Ramchatesingh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan V.

Hence, more fundamental research is needed to broaden our understanding of mechanisms underlying the origin and development of brain metastasis. We have identified that expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in cancer cells promotes brain metastasis growth in experimental mouse models through suppressing the antitumor immunity. Here, we interrogated the underlying mechanism that connects CDK5 with defective antitumor immunity. To understand the repertoire of CDK5 phosphorylation targets, we performed a quantitative stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) phopshoproteomics analysis of cultured brain-seeking cell lines that have been genetically engineered to express shRNA targeting the <i>CDK5<\/i> gene. The knockdown of CDK5 resulted in a dramatic dephosphorylation of multiple proteins, among which Interferon Regulatory Factor 2 Binding Protein 1 (Irf2bp1) is well recognized to function in mediating the immune response. Knockdown of CDK5 reduced the phosphorylation of Irf2bp1 at Ser66 in both 4T1 and T11 cells (Log<sub>10<\/sub> fold change: -0.51 and -0.39, respectively, P less than 0.0001). These findings were further validated by co-immunoprecipitation of Irf2bp1 in cell lysates from shCtl and shCDK5 brain-seeking cancer cell lines, followed by immunoblotting for phosphoserine. Furthermore, analysis of Irf2bp1 protein band shifts and intensities using Phos-tag&#8482; gels also demonstrated that CDK5 knockdown reduces the Irf2bp1 phosphorylation. In order to investigate the function of Irf2bp1, we established a stable knockdown of the <i>Irf2bp1<\/i> gene in brain metastasis-derived cell lines 4T1.Br3 and T11.Br1. We observed that <i>Irf2bp1<\/i>-knockdown cells displayed a reduced expression of genes encoding the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) as well as Nlrc5, a key transcriptional regulator of MHC I. Thus, these findings indicate that CDK5 may regulate the expression of surface MHC-I in breast cancer brain metastasis cells through Irf2bp1 phosphorylation at Ser66, in the absence of Interferon gamma or other classically recognized MHC-I agonists. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of MHC-I regulation in cancer cells, that might improve our knowledge about cancer cell immune evasion through MHC-I loss.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2eaf2f5-ed40-43c8-8527-370be5c212a6\/@y03B8ZHD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Metastasis,Immune response,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13084"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arseniy E.

When taking race and ethnicity into consideration, African Americans (AA) present with the highest incidence and mortality rates for CRC. Studies have found that AA patients, when compared to Caucasian American (CA) patients, have a lower response to the standard of care chemotherapeutic agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) as well as lower frequency of MSI tumors, making them also less likely to respond to conventional immunotherapies. Our recent findings have shown that tumors from AA patients present higher expression of genes involved in pro-inflammatory processes as well as lower expression of genes promoting anti-tumoral activities. One of the genes that was found upregulated in AA tumors is IL1B, which encodes for the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1&#946; (IL-1&#946;). Therefore, we investigated the role of the IL-1&#946; pathway in novel AA colon cancer cell lines. Here, we evaluated changes in cell proliferation, apoptosis, 5-FU response, and activation of inflammatory pathways.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Our approach includes analysis of gene expression in both AA and CA colon cancer cell lines by using RNA sequencing to evaluate pro-inflammatory genes differentially expressed among the cell lines. Furthermore, we used an MTS assay to detect viable cells following treatment with IL-1&#946;, alone or in combination with different concentrations of 5-FU, as well as analyzing changes in apoptosis via Flow Cytometry. To better understand the mechanisms of IL-1&#946;-induced effects, we used IL-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1Ra) to block the IL-1&#946; pathway and evaluated changes in cell viability and 5-FU response via MTS assay, as well as activation of NF-kB pathway, via detection of phospho-I&#1082;B-&#945; protein using Western Blot analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Results from MTS assays indicated that cell proliferation in response to IL-1&#946; differs between the AA and the CA colon cancer cell lines, with the AA colon cancer cells being more sensitive to lower concentrations of the cytokine when compared to CA cell lines. Further, we saw an increased expression of phospho-I&#1082;B-&#945; following treatment with IL-1&#946;. This expression was reduced when the cells were treated in combination with IL-1&#946; and the IL-1Ra. The IL-1Ra also appears to reduce the pro-proliferative effects induced by IL-1&#946;. Importantly, our results show that 5-FU sensitivity is drastically reduced in the presence of IL-1&#946; for both AA and CA colon cancer cell lines, suggesting that IL-1&#946; may play a role in defining resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Taken together, our results demonstrated a differential response to IL-1&#946; for the AA colon cancer cell lines, suggesting a probable role played by the cytokine in driving inflammation-related cancer progression and reveals a possible new target to exploit in immunotherapy for this population.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ebb3348f-c751-4a29-8ac7-af8450b6ee10\/@y03B8ZHD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"African American,Colorectal cancer,Inflammation,Interleukin-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13085"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marzia Spagnardi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenny Paredes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jone Garai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jovanny Zabaleta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennie Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Martello-Rooney<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite extensive characterization of the molecular and genetic features of GBM, there remains a paucity of viable treatment options, and this disease confers a dismal 5% 5-year survival rate. Genomic amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) occurs in 40-60% of primary GBM. Half of all EGFR-amplified cases of GBM also harbor EGFRvIII, a constitutively active, truncated variant of EGFR. EGFR and EGFRvIII transduce oncogenic signals via cytoplasmic mediators, including the JAK\/STAT signal transduction pathway. The oncogenic role of STAT3 has been well-studied in CNS malignancies; STAT3 has been found to induce the expression of target genes involved in the proliferative and invasive phenotypes of GBM. However, little is known about the mechanism and role of STAT5 activation in GBM progression. Microenvironmental cues and EGFRvIII signaling, lost in adherent cell culture, are required for STAT5 activation, making STAT5 difficult to study by conventional cell culture methods. Our recent data from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cultures demonstrates that activation of STAT5 is important in GBM cell invasion and survival. Further, STAT5 activation is present predominantly at the invasive periphery of the tumor. In this study, we seek to characterize the mechanism and role of STAT5 activation downstream of EGFRvIII in GBM. RNA sequencing of PDX tumors expressing stable shRNA knockdown of STAT3 or STAT5 indicate both redundant and distinct transcriptional changes induced by STAT3 and STAT5 in GBM. We also find that while STAT3 activation is dependent upon JAK1\/2, STAT5 activation is JAK-independent downstream of EGFRvIII in GBM. Depletion of JAK1\/2 expression by siRNA oligonucleotides and pharmacologic inhibition of JAK1\/2 suppressed STAT3 activation but not STAT5. In fact, targeting JAK2 with kinase inhibitor WP1066 suppressed STAT3 activation, but increased activation of STAT5 in GBM cells expressing EGFR\/EGFRvIII. Inhibition of Src family kinases (SFK), a family of upstream signaling effectors of the JAK\/STAT pathway, attenuates both STAT3 and STAT5 activation. These results suggest that activation of STAT5 may provide a therapeutic escape mechanism to JAK-STAT3 inhibition in GBM, necessitating dual STAT3 and STAT5 inhibition to successfully inhibit the distinct oncogenic signals transmitted by STAT3 and STAT5 to promote GBM cell survival and resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b57b6c2d-bf37-44a2-b982-a8d69cb906a5\/@y03B8ZHD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Cell signaling,STAT5,Src,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13086"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mylan Blomquist<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Serdar Tuncali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Sereduk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean Kloss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Loftus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nhan Tran<\/i><\/presenter>.

Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 6 (IGFBP-6) induces apoptosis by inhibiting IGF-1R upon binding to both IGF-1 and IGF-2, however, the role of IGFBP-6 in breast cancer has not been adequately studied. While IGFBP-6 can bind to both IGF-1 and IGF-2, the binding affinity for IGF2 is 20-fold higher compared to IGF1. To determine if IGFBP-6 modulates breast cancer cells, MCF-7 and T-47D cells were stably transfected with an IGFBP-6 expression plasmid. IGFBP6 over-expression resulted in decreased proliferation rates in both cell lines when compared to empty vector controls. To identify a mechanism of decreased proliferation rates, the activation of the IGF-1R-dependent AKT and MAPK mediators was measured. Reduced phosphorylation of MAPK and AKT was observed in both cell lines over-expressing IGFBP-6 compared to empty vector controls. MAPK and AKT phosphorylate ER&#945; at serine 118 and serine 167 respectively, therefore, ER&#945; phosphorylation at these residues was determined in the presence of IGFBP6 expression. Reduction in phosphorylation was greater in MCF-7 cells than T-47D cells when IGFBP6 was constitutively expressed. To determine if reduced ER&#945; phosphorylation altered expression of known targets of ER&#945;-modulated expression, such as IGF-1R and Progesterone Receptor (PR) was measured. Unexpectedly, IGF-1R and PR protein and transcript levels were greater in IGFBP6 over-expressing cells. Studies have shown that differences in ER&#945; phosphorylation change the recruitment of transcriptional modulators associated with ER&#945;-mediated transcription. These results suggest that despite reducing IGF-1R-dependent cell signaling,&nbsp;compensatory mechanisms may be induced to enhance ER&#945;-mediated expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/51bed186-a054-4eee-a6a6-622d6e9cd795\/@y03B8ZHD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor,IGFBP6,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13087"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Francisco Javier Lariz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin D.

Wnts are involved in a plethora of cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Deregulation of Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling is frequently observed in GBM, leading to glioma stem cell (GSC) maintenance, invasion, and resistance to therapy. Moreover, the cellular prion protein (PrPC) may interact with &#946;-catenin and activate transcriptional activity of the &#946;-catenin\/TCF complex. PrP<sup>C<\/sup> plays essential roles in proliferation and differentiation, and was shown to upregulate the activity of Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling on intestinal progenitors. Our group has demonstrated that PrPC is overexpressed in GBM and that this leads to a higher proliferation rate and stemness maintenance. We have also demonstrated that silencing PrPC decreases the expression of stem cell markers, self-renewal, and tumorigenesis of GSCs. To further explore this connection between Wnt signaling and PrPC , we generated PrP<sup>C<\/sup> KO human U87 and U251 GBM cells with the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We performed RNA sequencing and subsequently validated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by RT-qPCR. DESeq2 analysis comparing PrP<sup>C<\/sup>-KO GBM cells with wild-type controls resulted in 1,295 DEGs for U87 cells and 363 DEGs for U251 cells. Of those U87 and U251 DEGs, 28 and 10, respectively, are part of signaling pathways regulated by Wnt proteins. We chose to validate the upregulated DEGs CAMK2A, NFATC4, WISP1, PPP2R2B, SFRP2; and the downregulated DEGs RAC3 and SHH. In U87 GBM cells, expression patterns of CAMK2A, NFATC4, WISP1, PPP2R2B and SHH matched what we found on the RNAseq analysis, while RAC3 expression did not differ. In addition, SFRP2 was downregulated in U87 cells but appeared as an upregulated DEG. In U251 cells, expression of NFATC4 and CAMK2A was downregulated, and expression of RAC3 was upregulated. Interestingly, NFATC4, CAMK2A and RAC3 were not U251 DEGs in our RNAseq analysis, but their expression is altered in the PrP<sup>C<\/sup>-KO group. We will analyze the expression of SFRP2, PPP2R2B, WISP1 and SHH on U251 GBM cells. Our results indicate that the Wnt-Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> pathway may be activated in U87 PrPC-KO cells, due to the increased expression of NFATC4 and CAMK2A. Regarding the canonical Wnt signaling, it appears to be a balance in the expression of genes that activate or inhibit these pathways in PrPC-KO cells, since WISP1 and PPP2R2B were upregulated and SFRP2 was downregulated. Importantly, expression of SHH was downregulated in U87 PrPC-KO cells. Aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling is implicated in the invasive capacity of GBM. We will also evaluate the status of Wnt signaling on PrPC-KO cells through Western blotting. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that the Wnt signaling is affected by the KO of PrP<sup>C<\/sup> in GBM and further corroborate the importance of PrPC in Wnt signaling for GBM biology.

NQO1 is important for catalyzation, detoxification, and reduction of organic compounds including quinone. Elevated NQO1 expression is associated with increased pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) growth, and metastasis as well as poor prognosis. BBI 608 is a small molecule that exhibits potential therapeutic properties for PDAC due to its powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and ability to regulate multiple signaling pathways. The current study explores the binding capacity and ligand efficacy of BBI608 against NQO1 in PDAC. To observe the molecular properties of BBI608 and to analyze the exact mechanism of NQO1 on PDAC, computational approaches were applied, including molecular docking. This investigation provides a detailed understanding of the interaction between NQO1 and BBI608 and its implication in PDAC therapy. To support this computational analysis, we performed <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>studies. The combination of BBI608 with gemcitabine plus irradiation creates higher cytotoxicity (decreased proliferation, clonogenicity and increased Annexin V positive cells; p&#60;0.001) in PDAC cell lines and the mice bearing subcutaneous PANC-02 and MIA PaCa-2 model. Collectively, this investigation offers mechanistic insight into the cytotoxicity initiated by BBI608 and suggests further investigation of its utility for PDAC therapy is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/21b7daa8-7309-4890-ab24-ec23a0e9bfde\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Signaling,NQO1,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13089"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Purnachandra N.

Frequent recurrence and becoming resistant to chemotherapy are one of the causes that makes ovarian cancer deadly. Since recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant Wnt signaling plays an important role in cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are responsible of recurrence, metastasis and treatment failure, we tested whether regulation of Wnt signaling can be effective in ovarian cancer treatment. By treating CWP232228 which is a potent inhibitor of Wnt signaling to ovarian cancer cell lines and to a mouse model, we found CWP232228 effectively inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells which expresses high level of b-catenin and induce apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore CWP232228 reduces ovarian cancer cell migration, invasion and colony formation ability. Moreover CWP232228 reduces key features of CSCs. Taken together, our study suggests CWP232228 as a potential substance which might be effective in treating epithelial ovarian cancer with avoiding treatment failure.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/abc0cdbc-278c-4732-90dd-5723f4f37926\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Wnt signaling,Cancer stem cell,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13090"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>So-Jin Shin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seungmee Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyewon Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chi-Heum Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunyoung Ha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Hae Seo<\/i><\/presenter>.

Overexpression of NF-&#954;B and COX-2 involved in inflammation contributes to increased cell growth and invasiveness. The latter might be related to the activated AKT pathway.<br \/>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were suggested for pancreas cancers prophylaxis. Naturally occurring oleanolic acid (OA) was shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic activities. Coupling its analogs with NSAIDs may enhance this effect. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of two oleanolic acid oximes derivatives conjugated with diclofenac (DCL), 4c (3-diclofenacoxyiminoolean-12-en-28-oic acid benzyl ester) and 4d (3-diclofenacoxyiminoolean-12-en-28-oic acid morpholide) on inflammation-related pathways, MAPK and NF-&#954;B, cell cycle arrest and ROS formation in PSN-1 pancreatic cancer cells. PSN-1 cells were incubated with DCL, 4c or 4d at the concentration of 30&#181;M. Activation of NF-&#954;B was assessed by measuring binding of its p50 and p65 subunits to DNA using ELISA method. Their nuclear concentrations were determined by Western blot. RT-PCR was used to evaluate NF-&#954;B subunits and COX-2 mRNA levels. Bead-based immunoassay determined the cytosolic levels of p38, JNK, CREB, AKT, P70S6K and STAT3 proteins. Cell cycle distribution and ROS formation were assessed using flow cytometry. Conjugate 4d significantly reduced nuclear level of p65 subunit and its mRNA expression, although compound 4c had more significant impact on COX-2 expression. Both derivatives significantly diminished p65 DNA binding, but only 4d had significant effect on p50. Both compounds reduced ROS production, but neither of them affected the cell cycle arrest. We observed decreased cytosolic AKT level along with increased levels of unphosphorylated JNK and p38 kinases which may have an antagonistic effect on proliferation by reducing activity of inflammatory mediators acting as tumor promoters. AKT decrease after treatment with 4d derivative might be the cause of increased unphosphorylated CREB level. Accumulation of p38 and JNK in cytosol could be a result of decreased ROS production and\/or cause increased CREB protein level. Additionally, increased STAT3 cytosolic level suggests inhibition of mTORC1 pathway that explains reduced p70S6 kinase. Overall, these results suggest that OAO-DCL morpholide conjugate may affect both NF-&#954;B and MAPK signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer cells. Further studies are required to explain detailed mechanism of these modifications.<br \/><b>Funding:<\/b> Studies were supported by Polish National Science Centre grant 2016\/21\/B\/NZ7\/01758.<br \/><b>Acknowledgments:<\/b> Authors thank Dr. Gary Gorbsky, Chair of Cell Cycle &#38; Cancer Biology Program in Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation for supporting financing Maria Narozna conference participation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0af6881a-3d27-486b-8954-0f2971cd0dbc\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,NF-&#954;B,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13092"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Narozna<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Violetta Krajka-Kuzniak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Kleszcz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wanda Baer-Dubowska<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here, we demonstrated for the first-time significant broad dichotomy between these TGF-&#946; members: BMPs and TGF-&#946;\/activin and their regulated SMADs in this process. We previously reported BMP9\/GDF2 to be in low to undetected levels in ovarian cancer patient-derived ascites and promoted anoikis resistance in both breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. We have now identified additional BMPs -BMP2, BMP4 and BMP9 as promoting anoikis sensitivity in a spectrum of ovarian cancer cells. Conversely, we found TGF-&#946;s (1 and 2) to be in much higher expression and demonstrated that TGF-&#946; and activin promoted anoikis resistance in ovarian cancer. Hence, in an attempt to identify genes downstream of BMPs that may provide anoikis resistance, transcriptomics was performed leading to the identification of Sox2, a developmental gene with prior established roles in OVCA, as being significantly downregulated in response to BMP9. We further uncovered Sox2 to be reciprocally regulated by anoikis-promoting BMPs (2, 4 and 9) and anoikis suppressing TGF-&#946; and activin A. Our findings highlight a novel contrasting SMAD dependent regulation of Sox2 as a central node for controlling tumor cell survival in ovarian cancers demonstrating a subset of BMPs as a therapeutic strategy in cancer. The studies presented here begin to elucidate the mechanisms of reciprocal epigenetic regulation of Sox2 by BMP and TGF-&#946;\/activin in the context of ovarian cancer, which is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in women due to peritoneal metastatic spread.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e54aed2c-8e2e-4928-aa47-7e1e8bd14d7e\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Growth factor,Metastasis,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13093"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zainab M.

IGFBP-4 expression is induced by estrogen receptor &#945; (ER&#945;), and its classical function is to prevent activation of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) by sequestration of IGF-1. However, the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 shows high expression of IGFBP-4 along with its protease, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A). Further, inhibition of IGFBP-4 in MDA-MB-231 cells is sufficient to reduce migration. To better understand the function of IGFBP-4 as a pro-cancer or anti-cancer protein, its anti-proliferative effects in ER&#945; positive cells must be reconciled with its pro-migratory effects in triple negative cells. The role of IGFBP-4 in proliferation across four breast cancer cell lines representing ER&#945; positive and triple negative subtypes was investigated. Stable transfection with IGFBP-4 expression construct in the MCF-7 and T-47D cell lines, which have silenced the PAPP-A gene, shows a reduction in proliferation. Further, MCF-7 parental cells cultured in conditioned media containing IGFBP-4 also show reduced proliferation, suggesting that the anti-proliferative effect of IGFBP-4 is associated with the absence of PAPP-A. Stable IGFBP-4 transfection of triple-negative MDA-MB-468 cell line, which has low extracellular IGFBP-4 when compared to MDA-MB-231 but does express PAPP-A, was sufficient to increase proliferation. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that proliferative effects of IGFBP-4 are dependent upon the expression status of PAPP-A.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2802e770-df77-4ddd-87c9-40aec729e246\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein expression,Signaling pathways,Insulin-like growth factor (IGF),Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13094"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Keenan L.

FBXL16 is a poorly studied F-box protein. FBXL16 doesn&#8217;t interact with Cul1 and might not form a functional SCF-E3 ligase complex. Unexpectedly, we recently found that FBXL16 upregulates several oncoproteins targeted by SCF-E3 ligases, such as SRC-3 and c-myc, by antagonizing the activity of another F-box protein, FBW7. By data mining, we found that FBXL16 is highly upregulated in many cancers, including lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs), and its upregulation is associated with poor overall survival. LUAD is the most common form of lung cancer, and about 30% of LUADs harbor constitutively active oncogenic KRAS mutants. However, currently no drug is available for effectively treating LUADs expressing KRAS mutants. Hence, there is an unmet need to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we report that FBXL16 protein level is selectively upregulated and is strongly correlated with insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) protein expression in LUAD cell lines with activating KRAS mutations. By cycloheximide treatment, we found that FBXL16 greatly increases IRS-1 protein stability and level, leading to upregulation of IGF-1 (Insulin)\/IRS1\/PI3K Akt signaling. Importantly, the upregulation of IRS1 protein and its signaling by FBXL16 was confirmed in mouse lungs with conditional overexpression of FBXL16 transgene. Moreover, depletion of FBXL16 by RNA interference inhibits IGF-1-induced lung cancer cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, our findings reveal FBXL16 as a potential target for treating LUADs with KRAS activating mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/89c2c787-adcf-483c-a93f-5dd756e8e004\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,KRAS,Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),Signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13095"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marion Morel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiwen Long<\/i><\/presenter>.

Platycodin D is one of the major bioactive components of the <i>Platycodon grandiflorum<\/i>, a herb that is frequently used for the treatment of lung diseases in Chinese medicine. Platycodin D is a triterpenoid monomer with activities of antioxidant, anti-obesity, and anti-inflammatory. Studies have also shown that platycodin D has an anti-tumor effect on various types of cancer. However, the mechanism by which platycodin D suppresses tumorigenesis remains elusive and some experimental results are controversial. In this study, we aim to understand the effect of platycodin D on the growth of non-small lung cancer cells (NSCLC) and the underlying mechanism. We found that NSCLC cells (H1299, H2030, and A549 cells) treated with platycodin D significantly reduced the cell viability, decreased the number of colonies, impaired the mitochondrial function, and induced apoptosis. To understand the mechanism, the protein levels of the Bcl-2 protein family were examined and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) was found elevated by platycodin D treatment. The induction of PUMA expression by platycodin D treatment was through activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AP-1 dependent transcription since JNK inhibitor or over-expression of dominant negative c-Jun abolished the elevated PUMA expression. Moreover, knockdown of JNK1, but not JNK2, significantly decreased the level of platycodin D-induced PUMA and cleaved caspase 3, indicating the essential role of JNK1 in platycodin D-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, platycodin D efficiently suppressed the tumor growth in the H1299 xenograft. Taken together, activation of JNK1 by platycodin D is essential for induction of apoptosis in suppression of growth of NSCLC, providing a new mechanism of how platylcodin D suppresses NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a44b99f1-8dd0-4515-90de-de744211faed\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Tumor growth,Lung cancer,Natural products,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13096"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qing Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsin-Sheng Yang<\/i><\/presenter>.

It represents the sixth most common type of malignant tumor in the world. Risk factors include tobacco and alcohol usage and infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV-negative HNSCCs frequently display areas of cornification evident by keratin pearls in the tumor tissue. Cornification represents a natural differentiation path of keratinocytes in the normal epidermis and oral mucosa. To investigate the mechanisms of HNSCC cell differentiation we have established spheroid cell cultures from patient-derived HNSCC and parotid gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) tissue that grow in suspension under serum-free conditions. The use of a specific differentiation medium induced striking adhesion, loss of proliferation, and differentiation in tumor cells. Spheroid cells grew as single cell clones under serum-free conditions with a cloning efficiency of 40-60%, which was fully diminished under differentiating conditions. HNSCC cells cornified as indicated by the formation of lamellar bodies in the cytoplasm of adherent cells and an upregulation of cornification markers SPRR3 and involucrin. ACC cells upregulated parotid gland differentiation markers including &#945;-amylase. RNA-seq analysis in HNSCC cells confirmed an upregulation of signaling pathways associated with cornification and epithelial cell differentiation. Conversely, pathways regulating the three-dimensional organization of the genome were downregulated upon differentiation. This was accompanied by the formation of ATRX-positive heterochromatin foci in the nucleus of differentiated ACC and HNSCC cells resembling those previously described to arise during therapy-induced senescence. Moreover, gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis revealed a lack of essential amino acids including leucine to be implicated in the differentiation process. Altogether, our spheroid model of HNSCC and ACC cells is suitable to analyze the mechanisms underlying tumor cell differentiation and might lead to new therapeutic approaches that can drive long-term repopulating HNSCC and ACC cells into differentiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6f889061-1cc6-4398-a99c-9c92ade9dd89\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Differential gene expression,Cell signaling,Molecular targets,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13097"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Felix Oppel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Senyao Shao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Gendreizig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Kühnel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivien Przybycin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carsten Hain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pascal Schmidt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Schürmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Goon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karsten Niehaus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jörn Kalinowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Holger Sudhoff<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the role of cAMP signaling in malignant transformation of human melanocytes and initiation of melanoma is not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that cAMP signaling plays opposite roles in primary and metastatic melanoma cells, i.e., pro- and anti-proliferative roles, respectively. This switch in cAMP action is mediated by the alternative cAMP signaling axis involving EPAC-RAP1 (exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP-Ras-related protein 1). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of EPAC signaling is an early event in malignant transformation of melanocytes and is required for survival and proliferation of malignant melanocytes. Here, we show that shRNA-mediated knockdown of PTEN alone or PTEN-KD with lentiviral transduction with BRAF(V600E) results in upregulation of EPAC expression and activation of RAP1 (i.e., RAP1-GTP) in human primary melanocytes. Interestingly, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling alone is sufficient for stimulation of maximal EPAC expression as well as proliferation suggesting that EPAC activation is an early event associated with loss of PTEN and melanoma tumor initiation. Inhibition of EPAC activity by either EPAC 1\/2 or EPAC2-selective inhibitors suppressed the growth of transformed melanocytes by inhibiting cell cycle progression as evident by downregulation of cyclins E, -A2 and -B1. Inhibition of EPAC signaling also increased cells expressing senescence-associate beta galactosidase activity suggesting that EPAC may contribute to the senescence escape mechanisms in BRAF(V600E) melanocytes. Our data suggest that activation of PI3K pathway alone or in combination with mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activates EPAC signaling in melanocytes. Since primary but not metastatic melanoma cells remain dependent on EPAC signaling, understanding the mechanisms of action EPAC can open new avenues to prevent melanomagenesis and inhibit melanoma tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cfbd5c7c-81f5-4d2f-8b08-02122ef86d28\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant progression,BRAF,Cell cycle,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13098"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mithalesh Kumar Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Altameemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcos Lares<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shreyans Sadangi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Vijayasaradhi Setaluri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Oxidative stress has been shown to be increase in several cancers including prostate cancer. In fact, oxidative stress in prostate cancer is suggested to be a direct result of cell exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS). High mobility group A 2 (HMGA2), a non-histone protein, is an oncogene that is up-regulated in several cancers. This protein has ability to undergo chromosomal rearrangement and alternative splicing, causing its full length\/wild type HMGA2 (HMGA2-WT) to become the truncated losing its 3&#8217;UTR leading to the generation of HMGA2 truncated (HMGA2-TR). We have previously shown HMGA2-WT&#8217;s involvement in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), however, the functional role of HMGA2-TR has not yet been dissected.<b><i> <\/i><\/b><b><i>We<\/i><\/b><b><i> <\/i><\/b><b><i>hypothesize<\/i><\/b><b><i> <\/i><\/b><b><i>that<\/i><\/b><b><i> <\/i><\/b><b><i>truncated<\/i><\/b><b><i> <\/i><\/b><b><i>HMGA2&#8217;s<\/i><\/b><b><i> <\/i><\/b><b><i>involvement<\/i><\/b><b><i> <\/i><\/b><b><i>with <\/i><\/b><b><i>oxidative stress leads to prostate cancer progression<\/i><\/b>. We analyzed the baseline expression of wild-type<i> vs<\/i>.truncated HMGA2 in prostate patient tissue and cells lines by real-time PCR and western blot analyses. Prostate cancer patient tissue and some cell lines expressed increasing amounts of both wild-type and truncated HMGA2with increasing tumor grade, when compared to normal epithelial cells. RNA-Seq analysis of LNCaP prostate cancer cells stably overexpressing HMGA2-WT, HMGA2-TR, or empty vector (Neo) control revealed thatHMGA2-TR cells display increased oxidative stress compared to HMGA2-WT or Neo control cells. This was also confirmed by analysis of basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the ratio of GSH\/GSSG andNADP\/NADPH utilizing metabolomics. Additionally, proteomic analysis showed that HMGA2-TR protein interacted with several proteins, including a cytoplasmic stress granule protein G3BP1 that responds to oxidative stress. Transient knockdown of G3BP1 increased ROS in HMGA2-TR cells. These studies may therefore uncover novel role for truncated HMGA2 in oxidative stress.<br \/><b>Acknowledgements:<\/b> These studies were supported by the NIH\/NIMHD\/RCI Grant #5G12MD007590-31,NIH\/NIGMS\/RISE Grant #5R25GM060414","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7bb17ef7-b64e-4417-a4da-55773e583a66\/@z03B8ZHE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,HMGA2 truncated,Oxidative Stress,G3BP1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13099"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Taaliah Campbell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ohuod Hawsawi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Bowen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valerie Odero-Marah<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the present study, the anti-cancer effects of combinational therapy of Letrozole (Aromatase inhibitor) or Olaparib (PARP inhibitor) with Aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), were examined on well differentiated ER-positive and poorly differentiated triple negative breast cancer cell lines, T-47D and MDA-MB-231, respectively. In addition, the effect of combined treatment was also examined by detecting cell survival, cell cycle analysis, and alterations in signaling pathway that play a role in breast cancer progression such as &#946; -catenin, STAT3, cyclin D1, Bax, c-PARP, wild and Mutant p53. In addition the effect of combined treatments were examined on gene expression levels of Cytochromes; <i>CYP1A1<\/i>, <i>CYP1B1<\/i>, Aurora kinases; <i>Aurora-A<\/i> and <i>Aurora-B<\/i> were determined by RT-PCR.Our data showed that combined treatments of 50 nmol Letrozole or 250 nmol Olaparib with 5 mmol, 2.5mmol Aspirin for 24 and 48 h, respectively, promoted apoptosis induction through enhanced histone release and caspase-3 activation compared to control and cells treated with each drug alone. Furthermore, apoptotic induction was associated with upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2, cyclin D1, &#946;-catenin, and STAT3 signaling pathways in both tested cell lines compared to control, suggesting that Aspirin may enhance the sensitivity of tested cells to Letrozole or Olaparib in both (ER) positive and triple negative breast cancer cell lines. In addition, cell cycle analysis showed a cell arrest at G0\/G1 phase in both cell lines. Interestingly, in T-47D cells, combined treatment of Letrozole with Aspirin significantly upregulated wild p53 at protein level and downregulated <i>CYP1A1<\/i>, <i>CYP1B1<\/i>, <i>Aurora-A<\/i>, and <i>Aurora-B<\/i> expression at gene level compared to control, suggesting that combined treatment may inhibit breast <u>cancer cell<\/u><u><\/u> proliferation via down-regulation of <i>Aurora-A<\/i> and <i>Aurora-B<\/i>. In MDA-MB-231 cells, combined treatment of Olaparib with Aspirin showed a significant downregulation of Mutant p53 at protein level and <i>CYP1A1<\/i>, <i>CYP1B<\/i>1, <i>Aurora-B<\/i> and upregulation of <i>Aurora-A<\/i> at gene level compared to control, suggesting that there is a crosstalk between Olaparib\/ Aspirin and P53<br \/>In conclusion, combined treatment of Letrozole or Olaparib with Aspirin might be a promising approach to inhibit both ER (+) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines survival and proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7a54b0ff-1366-49ef-8327-9854fa65c9d8\/@A03B8ZHF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Apoptosis,p53,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13101"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"9fc7f03f-8e10-44d9-93d1-b707cc38acdf","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9fc7f03f-8e10-44d9-93d1-b707cc38acdf\/@A03B8ZHF\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marwa Elsayed ElKamel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Salah Sheweita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed Sultan<\/i><\/presenter>.
