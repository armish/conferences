[{"Abstract":"\u0009Conventional chemotherapy with maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has shown confident anti-cancer effect and when combined with targeted therapy, immunotherapy. Yet, understanding about how the MTD regimen is optimized has lacked due to its high tumor burdens. In this study, the oral doxorubicin (DOX) formulation was shown to improve oral bioavailability by 12.1 % and sustain the metronomic concentration through the flexible protocol. Since the optimizing dose and schedules of DOX in metronomic chemotherapy (MCT) is essential to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity, which is determined by the exposure of drugs based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) correlation, we developed an integrated systemic mathematical model that can evaluate the anti-tumor effect and the toxicity of oral DOX formulation simultaneously. Oral physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were established with dose dependency, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and tumor growth profiles were assessed as markers for toxicodynamic (TD) and PD models, respectively. Each model was validated and then integrated into the PK-TD\/PD model and the effects of various oral metronomic regimens were predicted. In conclusion, the finalized oral metronomic dosing regimen (10 mg\/kg, QD) showed 83.3 % tumor growth inhibition without cardiotoxicity. In this study, we defined the MCT regimen using a mathematical model and suggested a dose selection method for developing oral drugs from injections, to efficiently utilize the preclinical results and apply to clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a05401e-83ec-4b23-b1ed-f422d991836a\/@q03B8ZAw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Drug delivery,Pharmacokinetics,Doxorubicin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14747"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seho Kweon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoo-Seong Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoon Gun Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Woo Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ha Kyeong Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suk-Jae Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngro Byun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Yoon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Using neoantigen immunogenicity parameters from published reports, we first recapitulated the presentome of early-stage NSCLC. Upon simulating checkpoint blockade treatment of advanced NSCLC, we found salient correlates and consequences of response, including a profound clonal collapse among completely responding tumors.

Often, these therapies show limited efficacy in complete eradication of cancer cells making the combination of these two therapies an attractive cancer treatment option. The complications involved in dosing and scheduling of these therapies make mathematical modeling an appropriate method for analyzing and predicting disease response to these therapies. Here we propose a mathematical model evaluating disease response to the combination of these two therapies and explore the optimization of their dosing and scheduling.<br \/>Methods: An ordinary differential equation-based formalism is proposed for simulation of tumor response to CAR-T cell therapy as well as TRT. CAR-T cell dose and injected radioactivity was input to the model. Among others, key model parameters included tumor proliferation rate, tumor cell and CAR-T cell radiosensitivity, CAR-T cell killing rate, CAR-T cell decay rate indicating persistence. Preclinical experiments involving CS1- CAR-T cell therapy and <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-DOTA-Daratumumab TRT in a multiple myeloma mice model were used to parameterize the model. Sensitivity study of the model parameters using overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as evaluation metrics, was performed to elucidate the parameters with highest impact.<br \/>Results: OS and PFS were 97 and 55 days when CAR-T cell therapy was given prior to TRT as compared to OS of 43 days for untreated control mice. Sensitivity study of model parameters showed that tumor proliferation has the highest impact on survival metrics. For a &#177;50% change in tumor proliferation rate, OS changed by -41%\/+111% and PFS changed by -62%\/+147%. Similar changes in TRT injected activity and CAR-T cell dose changed OS by &#177; 15% and &#177;21% respectively. Accordingly, PFS changed by roughly &#177;32% and &#177;45% respectively. A variation of the interval between the therapies showed that faster growing tumors required a shorter interval between the two therapies. The sequence of therapies was also changed and TRT prior to CAR-T cell therapy demonstrated shorter PFS (43 days) due to the adverse effects of radiation on CAR-T cells.<br \/>Conclusion: For a fixed dose of TRT and CAR-T cells, tumor proliferation rate was found to be the prime factor impacting therapy interval. The presented work shows the key parameters required for planning and optimizing preclinical experiments and clinical trials.<b> <\/b>Using disease, CAR-T cell and radionuclide-specific parameters as shown in this work as well as incorporating immune stimulating effects of radiation would make it an extremely potent tool for optimizing combination therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/15e26ff5-feb2-4006-ad2e-e26e0eab5a54\/@q03B8ZAw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Targeted alpha therapy,CAR T cells,Radioimmunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14749"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vikram Adhikarla<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis Awuah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander B.

A representative product of metabolic reprogramming in cancers is oncometabolites that show abnormal accumulation in a cancer cell, induce malignancy, and are generated upon mutations in a metabolic gene, often <i>IDH1<\/i>, <i>SDH<\/i> or <i>FH<\/i>. Identification of novel mutation-associated metabolites will facilitate developing biomarkers and treatment strategies for cancers, as in the case of ivosidenib, an FDA approved drug for treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) having the <i>IDH1<\/i> mutant. To this end, we develop a computational workflow that predicts so-called metabolite-gene-pathway sets (MGPs) that present metabolites and metabolic pathways significantly associated with gene mutations in cancers. The computational workflow uses cancer patients&#8217; mutation data and a computational model of cellular metabolism called a genome-scale metabolic models (GEM). In this study, the computational workflow was demonstrated using 943 cancer patient-specific GEMs representing 24 different cancer types based on the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) data [1], which, as a result, predicted 4,135 MGPs for these multiple cancer types. The computational workflow was shown to generate biologically meaningful MGPs on the basis of multi-omics data from 17 AML samples collected in this study as well as previous published studies. For the AML samples, metabolites of the MGPs predicted using the computational workflow showed significantly different intracellular concentrations, depending on mutation of genes involved in the MGP. Moreover, for the 115 MGPs predicted for CNS-GBM\/Oligo that are associated with mutation of <i>CIC<\/i>, <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>IDH1<\/i> or <i>TP53<\/i>, 69% of the MGPs were supported by previous studies. This two-level validation indeed showed that it is possible to characterize metabolic pathways and their metabolites that are affected in response to somatic mutations in a cancer cell. Our computational workflow and its prediction outcomes will help better understand the mutation-associated metabolic reprogramming in cancers, and serve as a valuable resource for further extended studies on cancer metabolism.

In this work, we investigate the multiscale quantitative characteristics of the spatial organization and migration of cancer in 3D cultures. For this study, we combined 3D cell culture experiments of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells, hybrid spatiotemporal models, and longitudinal RNA-sequencing data analysis. The experiments included two experimental conditions; simple growth experiments, and experiments of growth in presence of the migrastatic drug Paclitaxel. The spatial distributions of the cells enabled us to calibrate and validate a hybrid Keller-Segel model, incorporated into a novel computational framework capable of interpreting the relation between morphological patterns and the underlying mechanisms of cancer growth [2]. The RNA-seq data included different time-points with and without treatment. The results suggested that cancer cells exhibited biased movement towards the bottom of the space, a movement that was inhibited in the presence of Paclitaxel. The calibrated model was able to describe the overall characteristics of the experimental observations, and suggested that cancer cells exhibited chemotactic migration and cell accumulation, as well as random motion throughout the period of development. The spatial pattern analysis revealed transient, non-random spatial distributions of cancer cells that consisted of clustered patterns across a wide range of neighbourhood distances, as well as dispersion for larger distances. The RNA-seq data exhibited coherence with the chemotactic migration hypothesis of the mathematical model, indicating significant under-representation of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to chemotactic migration in presence of the migrastatic drug. Overall, this study provided an insightful quantitative characterization of the spatiotemporal organization and progression of TNBC cells in 3D cultures. We anticipate that these developments will enable us to expand our studies to more realistic conditions, including the introduction of heterogeneic cell populations.<br \/>References<br \/>[1] Friedl, P., Locker, J., Sahai, E., &#38; Segall, J.

From monthly blood draws on both CM and control mice, we produced time-series messenger RNA (mRNA) and micro-RNA (miRNA) transcriptomic data. We have recently reported a state-transition model using the mRNA transcriptome data. We model the development of AML as a particle undergoing Brownian motion in a potential well with three critical points. Here, investigate whether the miRNA transcriptome can also be used to model AML development. Our current work is to extend the state-transition model using information theoretic approach to explore both the regulatory relationship between mRNA and miRNA and how a biological system transitions to a disease state.<br \/>Summary of Results: Our state-transition model detects early perturbations of the system before it can be detected using <i>cKit<\/i> expression, the marker of AML blasts in this model. Since individual mice develop AML stochastically in time, we used the state-transition model to align the mice based on the phenotypic disease state rather than chronological time. Four distinct expression dynamics of miRNAs were identified with hierarchical clustering: persistent increase or decrease in expression; and two nonlinear patterns of expression. The nonlinear dynamic groups showed changes in expression at the critical transition point between health and AML. Additionally, the nonlinear expression dynamic patterns occurred at the boundary between the health and AML states was associated with cytokines and systemic inflammation signaling pathways, suggesting an anti-leukemic restorative miRNA program. Using regulatory dynamics in the state-transition model, we observed unique mRNA-miRNA regulatory interactions which may suggest miRNA gene targets at critical transition points in leukemia progression.<br \/>Conclusions: Our information theoretic approach combined with our state-transition model is a promising approach to study AML development. This framework provides a method to integrate different -omic data without prior knowledge of the relationship between a gene and its regulatory features. Additionally, our approach can investigate the inter-individual heterogeneity of disease progression which has important implications for precision medicine. The state-transition analysis framework is a promising approach to explore the underlying principles that govern biological systems.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a861035-f682-4aac-82e8-e12b3fd49bb6\/@q03B8ZAw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Acute myeloid leukemia,Mathematical Modeling,Time-series,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14752"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David E.

There are currently no methods to accurately predict how a TNBC patient will respond to NAT before surgery. In this work, we applied a digital twin framework to address this unmet clinical need, by integrating quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data with mechanism-based mathematical modeling.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Multiparametric MRI was acquired in patients (N = 50) before, after 2 and 4 cycles of Adriamycin\/Cyclophosphamide (A\/C), and again after 12 cycles of Paclitaxel as part of the ARTEMIS (NCT02276433) trial. Within each imaging session, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and a pre-contrast <i>T<sub>1<\/sub><\/i>-map were acquired. The images were processed by a pipeline consisting of motion correction, multiparametric image alignment, inter-visit image registration to align the tumor and surrounding breast tissue, tissue segmentation, and estimation of tumor cellularity from DWI. A mechanism-based mathematical model, a reaction-diffusion equation, is used to characterize the mobility of tumor cells <i>via<\/i> diffusion damped by mechanical tissue properties, tumor proliferation <i>via<\/i> logistic growth, and treatment-induced cell death <i>via<\/i> the delivery and decay of therapies. For each patient, pre-treatment images were used for model initialization. The model calibration and prediction were implemented with two strategies: 1) using images acquired during the A\/C for calibration and predicting up to the end of A\/C, and 2) using images acquired during and after the A\/C for calibration and predicting up to the end of NAT. For strategy 1), we evaluated the model by comparing its predicted tumor volume and total tumor cellularity to the imaging measurements at the end of A\/C. For strategy 2), we evaluated the model by comparing its predicted final response to the post-surgical pathological findings.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>For strategy 1), our framework predicted the change of tumor volume and total tumor cellularity with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.91 and 0.89, respectively. Regarding strategy 2), our framework achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.88 for distinguishing pCR from non-pCR. As a comparison, imaging measurement of tumor volume at the end of A\/C achieved an AUC of 0.79.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our approach successfully captures the patient-specific dynamics of TNBC response to NAT and provides an improved prediction of final response, which demonstrates the potential of a digital twin framework to be a powerful tool for predicting response to NAT. Once validated, the method will provide a unique opportunity for optimizing treatment plans on a patient-specific basis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2ad5f961-debf-4a77-956d-8032e5954d9e\/@q03B8ZAw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Magnetic resonance imaging,Mathematical modeling,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14753"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chengyue Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela M.

To date, metastasis free survival (MFS) analysis mainly relies on classical - agnostic - statistical models (e.g., Cox regression). Instead, we propose to derive mechanistic models to predict MFS.<br \/>The data consisted of patients who did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy from two databases: one (data 1, N = 163) with routine clinical features and the PAI-1 and uPA biomarkers and two (data 2, N = 692) with 11 routine clinical features. The mathematical models are based on a partial differential equation describing a size-structured population of metastases. They predict MFS from the size of the tumor at diagnosis and two mathematical parameters, &#945; and &#956; describing respectively the tumor growth speed and metastatic dissemination potential. Using mixed-effects modeling, the population distributions of &#945; and &#956; were assumed to be lognormal and to depend on routine clinical variables, whereas the observation error was assumed lognormal on the time-to-relapse. Variable selection consisted first in a univariate Wald test for all covariates with effect either on &#945; or &#956;. We then used a backward elimination procedure. Significance of the covariates in the final model was assessed by a multivariable Wald test. Concordance indexes (c-index) were computed to assess the predictive power in cross-validation procedures as well as test sets.<br \/>The model was implemented as an R package using optimized C++ code for the mechanistic part and enabling parallelization, resulting in a 4-fold reduction of the computing compared to a former python implementation. Nevertheless, over 4 hours are still needed to run a 100 samples bootstrap on a distributed computing cluster. The model selection procedure on data 1 revealed an association of PAI1 and age with &#956;, and of Estrogen receptor level with alpha, consistent with the established biological link between PAI-1 and tumor invasiveness. The resulting model achieved good prediction performances with a c-index of 0.72 in 5 folds cross-validation. Using only routine clinical markers, the algorithm on data 2 selected a model with the grade and Progesterone Receptors in &#945;, Ki67 and node status in &#956;. These were able to adequately describe the data on calibration plots but performed poorly in prediction with a cross validated c-index of 0.60.<br \/>Mechanistic modeling was able to unravel the biological and predictive role of PAI-1 but showed limited predictive power when using only on routine clinical features.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1168408b-e715-4479-89f6-c81dff16c9c5\/@q03B8ZAw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Metastasis,Statistical approach,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14754"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Célestin Bigarré<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pascal Finetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>François Bertucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xavier Muracciole<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sébastien Benzekry<\/i><\/presenter>.

Accordingly, the rationale for designing new drug combinations is often based on synergy measured in preclinical models. However, preclinical metrics of drug interaction are not applicable to clinical trial data, and there has been no established quantitative method to assess synergy versus additivity in clinical settings. We recently showed that because of extensive patient-to-patient heterogeneity in single drug responsiveness, increasing the chance of a good response to at least one drug was a quantitatively sufficient explanation for the clinical efficacy of many approved combination therapies. Some combinations surpass this &#8216;highest single-agent&#8217; model, which could be due to either drug additivity or synergy. Here we propose and test a model of drug additivity for Progression-Free Survival (PFS) data from clinical trials, to identify if any approved combinations are clinically synergistic, as compared to additive.<br \/>METHODS We used PFS from trials as the clinical measure of drug efficacy. We defined &#8216;clinical drug additivity&#8217; as the sum of PFS times observed from each drug in a combination. Inter-patient heterogeneity in drug responses was simulated by sampling from the joint distribution of drugs&#8217; PFS distributions. For each combination, the clinically observed PFS distribution was compared to the additivity model, or the highest single-agent model (Palmer &#38; Sorger, 2017). Synergy is exhibited if an observed PFS distribution is significantly superior to PFS expected from additivity (by Cox Proportional Hazards). To search for drug synergy in clinical data, we analyzed approved combination therapies where synergy was most likely to explain efficacy, which are combinations where part of the regimen is not approved as monotherapy in the same disease. We analyzed 11 approved combination therapies for advanced cancers in the breast, ovary, pancreas, colon, cervix, and lymphatic system.<br \/>RESULTS None of the 11 approved combinations analyzed were significantly superior to the model of clinical additivity. For five combinations, the additivity model made the most accurate predictions of clinical efficacy (mean R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.97 for additivity, versus R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.83 for highest single-agent), and the other six combinations were most accurately described by the highest single-agent model (mean R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.97 for highest single-agent, versus R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.91 for additivity).<br \/>CONCLUSIONS Approved combination therapies are rarely &#8216;more than the sum of their parts&#8217; in quantitative terms. A straightforward definition of clinical drug additivity accurately matched trial results for combination therapies where synergy was expected. This suggests that single-agent efficacy by each drug is usually required for the clinical success of combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68d3be2d-9268-41ff-a196-fe17e4a32896\/@r03B8ZAx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Drug synergy,Clinical trial,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14756"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haeun Hwangbo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam C.

While breakthroughs in immunotherapy have improved patient survival for some disease subtypes, immune escape is an unfortunate and common hallmark of cancer evasion. Understanding the dynamic interplay between an evolving and heterogeneous malignant population and the adaptive immune system, consisting of millions of unique T cells, is therefore required for designing optimized treatment strategies. We begin by describing the implications of cancer escape via durable evasion events, such as major histocompatibility antigen presentation down-regulation. Durable escape is then applied to relate observed cancer age-specific incidence to physiologic impairments in T cell turnover and diversity. We then discuss a more generalized stochastic process that enables transient escape and recurrent recognition via distinct T cell subclones. This co-evolutionary model predicts repeated immune recognition and cancer evasion prior to disease manifestation. Using this model, we find that T cell turnover and cancer mutation rates explain differences in early age incidence data across nearly all cancer types. Lastly, we introduce a modeling approach for understanding the extent of optimality occurring in cancer evasion via tumor-associated antigen downregulation, emphasizing the utility of foundational modeling frameworks for optimizing cancer T cell immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0231fa3-1956-4700-a44c-61acf8b8b31b\/@r03B8ZAx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Cancer immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Systems biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14757"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason T.

The aim of this work is to apply communication theory and signal processing methods to model cytokine-mediated signaling errors in immune cells in the peripheral blood. Our approach uses communication theory concepts to develop a communication system model consisting of a transmitter, receiver, and channel, applied to the JAK\/STAT signaling pathway and tested using multi-color flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with IFN&#947;, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, or TGF&#946; in samples from 2 BC patients and 4 healthy controls. We use our model to estimate the detection error rate when one of the 7 cytokines is being transduced through the JAK\/STAT signaling pathway, but its signal is being received on multiple phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription (pSTAT) molecules. In addition, we extend the measured error rate value to an error rate curve by varying the signal-to-noise ratio available to the receiver in our system model. Our results show a trend towards higher detection error rates in immune cells from BC patients as compared to healthy controls, which may indicate altered immune signaling and incorrect cell decisions in these patients. Also, considering different cell subtypes, our results show two orders of magnitude increase in error rate in CD4+ memory T cells compared to CD4+ na&#239;ve T cells in BC patients. With further development, we believe that our communication theory model and quantification of optimal signal detection in cells will provide a better understanding into how immune cells can accurately &#8220;decode&#8221; information to respond properly to various signals and how the immune signaling is altered in BC patients, causing better or worse outcomes. The benefit of our novel approach is that it integrates all the transmitted (cytokines) and received signals (pSTATs) into a single communications framework that can be efficiently analyzed together.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Signaling,Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT),Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14759"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adina Matache<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Karolak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergio Branciamore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrei Rodin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter P.

The RNL is delivered <i>via<\/i> convection-enhanced delivery, resulting in a highly localized distribution around the glioma that produces up to a 30-fold increase in maximum tolerable dose. RNL provides a continuous source of low dose rate irradiation, until the particles are cleared biologically or decay. The goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a patient calibrated reaction-diffusion equation for predicting the growth and response of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) following treatment with RNL.<br \/>Methods: Multi-parametric images were collected from patients (n=10) receiving RNL treatment, consisting of pre-treatment and follow-up MRIs (Day 0, 28*, 56, 112*) and SPECT\/CTs acquired at the middle and end of infusion, and 24-, 112-, and 192-hours post-infusion. For each time point, tumor segmentations and cell count maps are computed using contrast enhanced and diffusion weighted MRI, respectively. The spatio-temporal response to RNL is modeled using a biology-informed reaction-diffusion model describing tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and radiation induced death. Key model parameters related to the RNL activity are populated through a quantification of the SPECT time course. The remaining model parameters related to diffusivity, proliferation, and death rate are calibrated <i>via<\/i> the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for each individual patient, and then used to forecast growth. Calibrations are performed in two different scenarios, first to all imaging time points to assess the model capabilities (Scenario 1), and then without the last acquired MRI, which is set aside to evaluate prediction accuracy (Scenario 2). Error will be assessed at the global (Dice similarity coefficient and percent error in total cell number) and local (concordance correlation coefficient or CCC) levels for both scenarios. *Patients are scanned on day 28 or day 112 at a minimum, potentially both (n=5)<br \/>Results: Scenario 1 calibrations produced on average, Dice=0.92, CCC=0.69, and total cell percent error = 10.2%, validating usage of the current model formulation. Scenario 2 calibrations show high prediction success on a global scale, mean Dice=0.78, mean total cell percent error =23%, but resulted in poor local accuracy, mean CCC=0.21.<br \/>Discussion &#38; conclusion: The mathematical model and processing framework can predict the spatiotemporal evolution of recurrent GBM after treatment with RNL. Ongoing efforts include validating the methodology on a larger cohort and further model selection to improve predictive capabilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4272deda-bea2-4eea-8529-ed1e5ca093c5\/@r03B8ZAx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Theranostics,Patient Specific,Response Predictions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18391"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chase Christenson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chengyue Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David A.

For in vivo pharmacology studies, tumor-bearing mice are treated by drugs and efficacy is monitored by continuingly measuring tumor volumes over weeks or even months, resulting in mouse-specific tumor growth data. In our previous study, we used linear mixed model (LMM) to fit tumor growth data and demonstrated its superiority to simple readouts, such as tumor growth inhibition (TGI), in discovering biomarkers and exploring mechanism of action for drugs. Here we extended the study to more parametric statistical models on an expanded dataset with over 100 thousand tumor growth curves. Six parametric models (exponential, exponential square, Gompertz, Logistic, Monomolecular, and von Bertalanffy) were fit to tumor growth curves within a single-treatment group, by the least square method after variance stabilization transformation. Best models were selected by Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based confidence set. In the Irinotecan case study, logarithmic transformation of tumor volume converts exponential or exponential square models to mixed-effects linear models that integrate random effect of mouse difference within a treatment group, and are used to identify predictive biomarkers for drug efficacy. We compared three variance stabilization transformations and found that log transformation of tumor volume is appropriate for majority of tumor growth curves. In log transformed data, exponential or exponential square model can satisfactorily fit nearly all tumor growth curves, as 96.1% of best model confidence sets contain exponential or exponential square model, followed by von Bertalanffy (92.5%), Gompertz (92.1%), Logistic (90.5%), and Monomolecular (58.9%). The percentage of studies, in which all treatment groups can be best fit by exponential or exponential square model, is 91.3% (82.4% for von Bertalanffy, 81.4% for Gompertz, 79.1% for Logistic, 37.3% for Monomolecular). Thus, exponential or exponential square model can be applied to most in vivo mouse studies, and should be preferred for their mathematical simplicity and interpretability. We further demonstrated the utility of the modeling method on a 16-PDX-model study for Irinotecan to identify biological processes and pathways related to its mechanism of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c577ce2-e145-4779-8163-02896d2e9070\/@r03B8ZAx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Biomarkers,Efficacy,Statistical approach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19394"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huajun Zhou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Binchen Mao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheng Guo<\/i><\/presenter>.
