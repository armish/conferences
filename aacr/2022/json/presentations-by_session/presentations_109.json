Further analyses suggest changes increase with high levels of both replication-division (R=0.24) and the stiffness E of each tissue (R=0.6). Chromosome copy number gains and losses -- aneuploidy -- follow these trends, which prompted our hypothesis that stiff 3d microenvironments could increase aneuploidy of dividing cells moreso than less confining or microenvironments. We developed a method of live-cell monitoring of changes to chromosome copy numbers and used it to study diverse perturbations, particularly compressed mitosis seen <i>in vivo<\/i>. Many dividing cells die when squeezed, but rare stem cells and cancer cells show heritable loss of mono-allelic, GFP\/RFP-tagged constitutive genes that function as Chromosome-reporters (ChReporters). Flattening spreads mitotic chromatin, favors chromosome mis-segregation, and increases ChReporter loss independent of an established spindle assembly checkpoint. Inhibiting the high level of Topoisomerase in such cells impedes chromosome compaction, division, and ChReporter loss, whereas the proposed tumor suppressor Myosin-IIA stabilizes chromatin against fragmentation, with knockdown increasing ChReporter loss. Solid human tumors and teratomas show similar ChReporter trends in mice, and single-cell-sequencing identifies rare chromosome changes exclusively in normal 3D-infiltrative cells while also relating specific chromosome losses to altered growth and motility. 3D rigidity thus gives rise to heritable aneuploidy as a mechanogenetic change.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Physical sciences in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Microenvironment,Chromosomal Instability,Aneuploidy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dennis Discher<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
