Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) and Smoldering Myeloma (SMM) are plasma cell premalignancies that precede Multiple Myeloma (MM) and exhibit signs of immune dysregulation; they affect approximately 5% of the population over 50 years of age, who remain largely undiagnosed, due to lack of screening. In November 2019, we launched the IMPACT study to characterize the immune response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias and healthy individuals.<br \/>Methods: We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on 224 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples drawn from 118 IMPACT (IRB #20-332) participants with MGUS (n=20), SMM (n=48), or MM (n=24), as well as healthy individuals (n=26). Samples were collected before vaccination and after 2 doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNtech) (n=123), mRNA-1273 (Moderna) (n=83) or 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) (n=14).<br \/>Results: Overall, we sequenced 2,025,611 cells from 224 samples of 118 patients with MGUS, SMM, MM and healthy individuals pre- and post-vaccination for SARS-CoV2, and profiled 553,082 T-cells, 95,392 B-cells, 74,394 NK cells, 195,371 Monocytes, and 35,236 Dendritic cells (DC). We identified activated clusters of B-cells, NK cells and DCs expressing genes such as <i>CD83<\/i>, <i>CD69<\/i>, <i>CXCR4<\/i>, and genes related to the NF-kB and AP-1 pathways. We compared cell type abundances pre- and post-vaccination within each participant population and found that activated <i>CD83<\/i>+ cells significantly increased post-vaccination in healthy individuals and patients with MGUS (paired t-test, q &#60; 0.1), but not in patients with SMM or overt MM. At baseline, patients with SMM and MM had significantly fewer memory B-cells and significantly more cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells, compared to healthy individuals (Wilcoxon, q &#60; 0.1), which could partly explain the differences observed post-vaccination. Patients with MM also had significantly higher levels of tolerogenic IL-10-expressing DCs (DC10) at baseline (Wilcoxon, q &#60; 0.1), which could be dampening antigen-specific T-cell responses.<br \/>Conclusion: We identified a significant expansion of activated B-cell, NK cell and DC subpopulations expressing <i>CD83<\/i>, <i>CD69<\/i> and <i>CXCR4<\/i>, following vaccination in healthy individuals and patients with MGUS, but less so in patients with SMM and overt MM. Our results provide insight into the cellular mechanisms of immune response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination in healthy individuals and patients with precursor plasma cell malignancies and suggest that asymptomatic individuals with SMM may exhibit inferior response to vaccination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-06 COVID-19 vaccines and immune responses among cancer patients,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Single cell,Immune cells,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Romanos Sklavenitis-Pistofidis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshinobu Konishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Aranha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahshid Rahmat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ting Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Timonian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shohreh Varmeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Heilpern-Mallory<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael P.

One such potential antiviral strategy is to target the synthetic lethal (SL) partners of transcriptionally altered genes in infected host cells, thereby selectively killing them to halt the infection at its heels (Mast FD, JCB, 2020).<br \/>Methods: Here we conduct a first proof-of-concept SL inference approach to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets in a systematic genome-wide manner. This effort capitalizes on our recently published pipeline for inferring clinically relevant SL interactions in cancer (Lee et al, Cell, 2021). Based on the latter, we comprehensively analyzed multiple <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infection to predict candidate antiviral targets that are SL with altered host genes. Importantly, as our predictions are fine-tuned based on the analysis of patients&#8217; data, they are more likely to be of translational value.<br \/>Results: Our key results are twofold:1) The predicted SL-based targets are highly enriched for genes that are reported in four SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide genetic screens to inhibit growth of infected cells. 2) A subset of top predicted 26 genes were experimentally tested in a targeted siRNA screen conducted in both infected and non-infected human Caco-2 cells. Remarkably, as expected given that these targets were predicted to be SL specific with genes upregulated in infected cells, indeed, knocking down these targets reduced viral replication and cell viability only under the infected condition without harming non-infected cells.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate the potential of a synthetic lethality approach to identify viral (specifically anti-SARS-CoV-2) targets. Importantly, as both single cell and bulk transcriptomics patients&#8217; data is considered from both infected people and controls, they are more likely to be of clinical relevance. Targeting host genes identified via an SL-based approach is probably more suitable when the infection is at the early stage and host can still tolerate the loss of infected host cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-12 Intersection of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,siRNA,Expression analysis,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lipika R.

The intervention that has a far-reaching impact is the adoption of an efficient nationwide vaccination campaign with the effective COVID-19 vaccines. The success of this strategy is dependent on the capacity of the existing healthcare systems and the public vaccine acceptance. Vaccine hesitancy is considered among the top global health threats. Its patterns and intensity vary by geosocial contexts. Due to the roll-out of the vaccine which was followed by the booster dose, we explored the demographic pattern and reasons behind the primary and secondary COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among our ArkLATX cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: Two cohorts were used to conduct this study (cohort 1 for primary and Cohort 2 for secondary vaccine hesitancy). An in-person survey of a random sample was conducted across 5 Hematology-Oncology clinics asking the veterans whether they are interested in receiving the initial COVID-19 vaccine and later the booster dose. If the veterans declined, they were asked to state the reason behind their decision. Age, sex, race, and state of residence were captured for each participant. Descriptive statistics were calculated and X<sup>2 <\/sup>and logistic regression were carried out to determine the impact of demographic factors on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.<br \/>Results: Cohorts 1&#38;2 consisted of 240 and 303 veterans, respectively. The median age was 71 years. The participants were around 92% male vs 8% female and around 41% Black vs 59% White. In cohort-1, 21% declined due to concerns about safety (33%), not wanting to be the first (33%), anti-vaxxer stance (14%), and inadequate information (8%). Among other reasons (12%), 3 saw no reason for the vaccination, 2 cited severe reactions to prior vaccines, and 1 cited mistrust of the government. In cohort-2, 14% declined booster dose due to concerns about the need (55%) and safety (14%), anti-vax (19%), suspicious (5%), and medical reason and timing (7%). There were no statistical differences between veterans that approved of or declined receiving the vaccine with respect to demographic characteristics.<br \/>Conclusions: Our survey indicates that the majority of ArkLATX high-risk veterans with cancer are willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The major reasons behind vaccine primary and secondary hesitancy seem to be categorized as information issues consisting of questions about safety and the need for the vaccine. For primary hesitancy another major group consisted of a &#8220;diffusion of innovation late majority&#8221; that are open to COVID-19 vaccination, but they do not want to be the first to take it. Such barriers can be potentially circumvented by providing the appropriate targeted information campaigns and provider counseling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-15 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Cohort study,Vaccines,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Philip A.

It is currently unknown whether disparities exist in cancer treatment delivery among racial\/ethnic minority patients with cancer and SARS-CoV-2.<br \/>Methods: Data were obtained from the ASCO COVID-19 and Cancer Registry (March 2020-July 2021), including data from cancer patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 during their care (n=3193) at 60 practices across the US. Data included patient demographics, SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and treatment, cancer clinical characteristics, and modifications to cancer treatment plans. Cancer treatment delay or discontinuation (TDD) was defined as any treatment postponed more than two weeks from the original scheduled date. We descriptively evaluated demographic and clinical characteristics, compared disparities in TDD by race\/ethnicity and urban\/rural residency, and evaluated reasons for TDD as reported by the clinics. We computed adjusted odds ratios (aOR) using multivariable logistic regression, accounting for non-independence of patients within hospitals to evaluate racial\/ethnic disparities of TDD. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, number of comorbidities, cancer type, cancer extent, cancer status at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (progressing\/stable) and SARS-CoV-2 severity (death\/hospitalization\/ICU admission\/mechanical ventilation).<br \/>Results: Cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2were mostly female (57%), urban residents (84%), and NH-White (66%); 49% were 65+ years old. Most patients had solid tumors (75%). At SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, 2403 patients (76%) were scheduled to receive drug-based therapy (69%), radiation therapy (7%), surgery (4%), or transplant (0.7%), of whom 49% experienced TDD. The most reported TDD reason from the clinic perspective was the patient&#8217;s COVID-19 disease (90%). Overall, NH-Black (64%) and Hispanic (57%) with SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to experience TDD versus NH-White adults (46%) (p&#60;0.001). This disparity was also observed across urban residing adults (p&#60;0.001). Among rural adults, NH-AI\/AN (75%) and NH-Black (61%) were more likely to experience TDD versus NH-White patients (39%). In multivariable analyses, disparities persisted, by NH-Black cancer patients with 92% (aOR:1.92, 95% CI:1.24-2.96) and Hispanic patients with 41% (aOR:1.41, 95% CI:1.03-1.91) higher odds of experiencing TDD. We observed consistent results among urban and rural subgroups.<br \/>Conclusion: Racial\/ethnic disparities exist in TDD among cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 in urban and rural care settings. Future studies should evaluate the impacts of delays to cancer treatment delivery on cancer outcomes among minoritized communities in the US.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-11 Health inequities and disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Epidemiology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jessica Yasmine Islam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cassandra A.

Our prospective clinical study evaluated immune responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in patients with B-cell lymphoma who had received CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy.<br \/>Methods: We measured SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity of plasma from 18 patients and 4 healthy controls (HC) and antibody titers against viral spike proteins (S1, S2, RBD) including their &#8220;delta&#8221; variants using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). We measured B cell subpopulations in the patients&#8217; blood using flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: We found that the peripheral blood plasma from 3\/4 HCs showed substantial SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity already at 4 weeks after the first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine while none of the CD19 CART patients evidenced any antibody-mediated neutralizing activity at the same point in time. At 4 weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, all 4 HCs showed complete neutralizing activity. In marked contrast, only 1 of 14 CART patients evidenced any relevant antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity. Assessing whether a globally insufficient antibody-mediated immunity was the underlying cause of the lack of a response to the COVID-19 vaccine in our CART patients, we found that IgG antibody levels against common microbial and viral antigens like influenza, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and tetanus toxoid, were comparable to those observed in HCs. However, while at 4 weeks post second dose of the vaccine the HCs showed high levels of vaccine-induced IgG antibody titers against all the viral spike proteins (S1, S2, RBD), including the &#8220;delta&#8221; variants of the S1 and RBD proteins, the vast majority of our CART patients did not evidence any SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Importantly, a third &#8220;booster&#8221; vaccination did not lead to an improvement in the antiviral immunity in the 4 CART patients analyzed. When we assessed B cell subpopulations in the blood of patients and HCs, we found that prior<br \/>treatments had completely eradicated all CD19+\/CD20+ B cells in the patients while numbers of long-lived memory plasma cells were comparable to those of HCs.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, 17 of 18 patients with lymphoma who received CD19 CART therapy had very poor immunoreactivity to 1-3 doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Importantly, antibody responses to common recall antigens were preserved, suggesting impaired immune response primarily against novel antigens like SARS-COV-2. This lack of immunoreactivity against novel antigens was probably based on the eradication of earlier-stage B cell subpopulations after treatment with anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-06 COVID-19 vaccines and immune responses among cancer patients,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,CD19 CAR T cells Therapy,B-Cell Malignancies,COVID-19 Vaccination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Thierry Iraguha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saurabh Dahiya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Avila<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Rapoport<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Luetkens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Djordje Atanackovic<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Research has reported that African American (AA) cancer patients with COVID-19 had a higher hospitalization rate than their white counterparts. Because the severity of COVID-19 is partly related to existing chronic diseases, one of the speculations is that racial differences in COVID-19 severity are attributable to AA cancer patients having a higher prevalence of chronic illnesses. Our study aimed to assess the impact of existing chronic diseases on the racial differences in hospitalization and length of hospitalization in COVID-19 cancer patients in Louisiana.<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>We linked cancer cases diagnosed in 2015-2019 from the Louisiana Tumor Registry (LTR) with the statewide COVID-19 data to identify COVID-19 patients who had been previously diagnosed with cancer. We also identified chronic illnesses (i.e., heart disease, peripheral vascular and cerebrovascular diseases, pulmonary disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and others) from 2012-2020 hospital discharge data and LTR data. Age and census tract level poverty were at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used to exam the association of race with hospitalization after adjusting for socio-demographic and chronic illnesses. The multivariable Poisson model was used to assess the racial disparity in length (in days) of hospitalization.<br \/><b>Results. <\/b>Of 6,518 COVID-19 cancer patients, there were 30.8% AA, 68.4% whites, and 0.8% other races. AA, male, older, residing in high poverty, and patients with chronic illnesses were more likely (P&#60;0.05) to be hospitalized. The odds of hospitalization was 87.2% higher among AA patients than white patients in bivariate analysis. After adjusting for age, gender, poverty, obesity, smoking status, and chronic illnesses, the odds of hospitalization was still higher for AA than white patients (OR=1.81;95% CI: 1.55-2.09). The length of hospital stay for AA was more (P&#60;0.05) than whites After adjusting for the same covariates.<br \/><b>Conclusion. <\/b>Sociodemographic factors and chronic illnesses are associated with the severity of COVID-19 among cancer patients. However, AA COVID-19 cancer patients have significantly higher odds of hospitalization and longer hospital stays even when controlling these factors. More research is warranted to determine underlying factors of the observed racial disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-11 Health inequities and disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Epidemiology,Comorbidity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiao-Cheng Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Yi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren S.

Besides humoral immunity mediated by B cells, T cell immunity is key for the control of viral infections. We developed the peptide-based vaccine candidate CoVac-1, which primarily aims for the induction of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. CoVac-1 comprises six promiscuous HLA-DR-binding SARS-CoV-2-derived T cell epitopes from various viral proteins proven (i) to be frequently and HLA-independently recognized by T cells in COVID-19 convalescents, (ii) to be of pathophysiological relevance for T cell immunity to combat COVID-19, and (iii) to mediate long-term immunity after infection (Nelde <i>et al.<\/i> Nat Immunol 2021, Bilich <i>et al.<\/i> Sci Transl Med 2021). CoVac-1 vaccine peptides are adjuvanted with the novel toll-like receptor 1\/2 agonist XS15 emulsified in Montanide<sup>TM<\/sup> ISA51 VG. In a first-in-human clinical trial in healthy adults (NCT04546841), CoVac-1 showed a favorable safety profile and induced profound and long-lasting T cell immunity after single dose administration in 100% of the study subjects, mediated by multifunctional T-helper 1 CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. CoVac-1-induced T cell responses surpassed those after SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as those after vaccination with approved vaccines and were unaffected by current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Heitmann <i>et al.<\/i> Nature 2021). Here we present the interim safety and immunogenicity results of our Phase I\/II trial evaluating CoVac-1 in patients with congenital or acquired B cell deficiency, mainly comprising leukemia and lymphoma patients (NCT04954469). 64% of study subjects had previously been vaccinated with approved vaccines without developing any humoral immune response. Alike in the healthy adults, CoVac-1 showed a good safety and tolerability profile without relevant systemic adverse events. CoVac-1-specific T cell responses could be documented in 93% of study subjects on day 28 after CoVac-1 application, with earliest responses evidenced at day 14 (71%). Vaccine-induced T cell responses were mediated by multifunctional T-helper 1 CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Of note, CoVac-1 induced T cell responses in this highly immune compromised study population were similar to those occurring in healthy volunteers after natural infection or induced by approved vaccines. These results identify CoVac-1 as promising vaccine candidate for cancer and other immunocompromised patients with immunoglobulin deficiency. Recruitment of the Phase II part of the trial is ongoing with results expected for March 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT07-01 Phase I,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Peptides,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Claudia Tandler<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas S.

Sophisticated and detailed studies which go beyond a single measure are required particularly with correlation to multiple disease and treatment factors. This study cohort is unique due to (a) very low prior COVID-19 infection at time of sampling (July-Nov 2021), (b) vaccines studied were BNT162b2 (Pf) given 3 weeks apart or ChAdOx1 (AZ) spaced 12 weeks (dose 1, 2) (c) most participants then received a third dose 2 months later (heterologous for AZ).<br \/>Methods: SerOzNET (ACTRN12621001004853) enrols Australian blood and solid cancer patients prior to vaccination, with serial blood analyses and qualitative measures. We measured neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against SARS-CoV-2 wild type (wt) and variants of concern delta and omicron, quantitative S-protein IgG antibody level (Abbott), and T-cell correlates (interferon-g, tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukins 2\/4\/5\/13) and epigenetic profiling at baseline and 3-4 weeks post dose 1, 2 +\/- 3.<br \/>Results: 379 participants were included, median age 58 years (IQR 47-66) and 60% female. 30% participants had hematological malignancies with the remainder solid organ cancers. 90% patients were on current systemic cancer treatment (most commonly chemotherapy in 41%, chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy in 20%). In 331 patients where treatment intent was recorded, 47% was palliative. Only one patient had known prior COVID-19 infection. Of the initial 94 participants who received Pf vaccination, median (IQR) neutralizing antibody titre 4 weeks following dose 2 was 80 (40-160) for SARS-CoV-2 wt and 40 (0-80) for delta variant.<br \/>Conclusion: Neutralizing antibody titres in this Australian cancer population following Pf vaccination appear lower than those reported elsewhere such as CAPTURE study (Fendler et al, 2021), possibly related to shorter interdose interval. Preliminary data highlights low nAb titres as expected in haematology patients but also in some cases with treatment not traditionally associated with immunosuppression such as hormonal therapy. These results will be updated in February 2022 with third dose, AZ and omicron variant data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL07-04 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase IV, observational, and expanded access,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Survival,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Eva Segelov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Body<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vi Luong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Aedo Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luxi Lal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hesham Abdulla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stuart Turville<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zin Niang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Opat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert McCuaig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie Lineburg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sudha Rao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Corey Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raina MacIntyre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Elizabeth Ahern<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
