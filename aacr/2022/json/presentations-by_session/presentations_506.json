[{"Abstract":"Background: The small molecule CCX559 is a novel, highly potent inhibitor of human PD-L1 being developed as an oral treatment for cancer patients. We have previously demonstrated that CCX559 has nanomolar potency and high selectivity for PD-L1; that it enhances primary T cell activation and has anti-tumor efficacy, including the ability to induce complete responses, using in vivo models<sup>1<\/sup>.<br \/>Results: Safety pharmacology studies in preclinical animal species demonstrated pharmacokinetics and an acceptable safety profile for CCX559, which supported the initiation of human trials in patients with advanced tumors. Prior findings from toxicology studies were consistent with immune modulation, including consumptive coagulopathy, increased white blood cell counts, and changes in IL-6 plasma levels. A Phase 1, first in patient, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study was initiated, with a starting dose of once-daily (QD) oral dosing at 30 mg. The primary objectives are safety\/tolerability, as well pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments aimed at determining a future phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives include pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments of immune cell activation in patient peripheral blood samples, as well as anti-tumor effects. For PK, intensive blood sampling is done on day 1 and day 21 of the first cycle of dosing; additional samples are collected on select days throughout the 21-day treatment cycles. PD analyses are done on selected blood draws as well. The first patient dosed (30 mg QD) showed that the drug was well tolerated with no adverse events reported. Preliminary PK results from this patient revealed CCX559 exposure levels consistent with preclinical predictions. Moreover, PD samples showed elevations in T cell proliferation and activation within the first 15 days, when compared to the predose sample. In conclusion, the preclinical data support clinical development of CCX559. CCX559 shows encouraging initial PK and PD results, and patient enrollment is ongoing in the trial (ACTRN12621001342808).<br \/>References: <sup>1<\/sup>Chris Li, et al.

To study focal aggregates of T-lymphocytes, a deep learning-based framework for automated identification of T-cell accumulations (T-cell-nests) was developed using CD8, PD-1, CD112R, and Ki67 multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry. To evaluate the clinical significance of these parameters, a cohort of 523 colorectal cancers with clinical-follow up data was analyzed. The spatial analysis of locally enriched CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell densities and cell-to-cell contacts identified T-cell-nests in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer. CD112R and PD-1 expression on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells located in T-cell-nests was found elevated as compared to CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells in all other tumor compartments (p&#60;0.001 each). Although the highest mean CD112R expression on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells was observed at the invasive margin, the PD-1 expression on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells was elevated in the center of the tumor (p&#60;0.001 each). Across all tissue compartments, proliferating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells showed higher relative CD112R and PD-1 expression compared to non-proliferating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells (p&#60;0.001 each). Integration of all available spatial and immune checkpoint expression parameters (AUC: 0.65) revealed a superior predictive performance for overall survival compared to the commonly used CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs density (AUC 0.57, p&#60;0.001). Cytotoxic T-cells with elevated CD112R and PD-1 expression levels are orchestrated in T-cells-nests of colorectal cancer, predict favorable patient&#8217;s outcome and the spatial non-redundancy underlies fundamental differences of both inhibitory immune checkpoints that provide a rationale for dual anti-CD112R\/ PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b3706553-de5e-4655-aaf3-2d66bc29e1db\/@u03B8ZPt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,PD-1,Immunohistochemistry,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16644"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Maximilian Lennartz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Mandelkow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Bady<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald Simon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Hube-Magg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guido Sauter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Niclas C.

However, the majority of patients does not respond to the currently employed antibody-based treatments, indicating a need for additional targets and new treatment modalities. The invention of 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation chemistries like locked nucleic acids (LNAs) has allowed the development of highly specific and efficacious antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that allow target knockdown <i>in vivo<\/i> without the need for complex delivery formulations.<br \/>The membrane-bound protein neuropilin-1 (NRP1) was initially identified as a factor involved in cell migration, -survival, and neoangiogenesis making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. It was subsequently shown that it has additional immune-mediated pro-tumorigenic roles. It can suppress anti-tumor immune activity via regulation of trafficking of tumor-associated macrophages, phenotypic stability of Tregs, and exhaustion of effector T cells. Considering that these effects are mediated by multiple domains of NRP1, there is a conceptual advantage to down-regulate the expression of the whole protein over the functional or steric blockade of individual domains.<br \/>We used our in-house Oligofyer&#8482; bioinformatics system to design both human NRP1 specific LNAplus&#8482; ASOs, as well as murine surrogates, which both achieved target knock-down of more than 85% <i>in vitro<\/i>. Furthermore, the murine surrogate down regulated NRP1 in tumor mouse models. Systemic application of mouse-specific ASOs without additional carriers or adjuvants has led to a strong delay of tumor growth or complete eradication in syngeneic mouse models. This effect was almost completely abrogated in immune-compromised NSG mice. Furthermore, re-challenge of immune-competent mice after tumor eradication did not result in new tumor growth, suggesting induction of a long-lasting immunity by LNAplus&#8482; ASO-mediated knockdown of NRP1. Taken together, these encouraging results indicate that the ASO-mediated down-regulation of NRP1 has the potential to become a promising treatment option for patients in need. We are currently performing further experiments to fully elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the observed anti-tumor efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ff1fa679-3c2b-4f8c-b609-20f338534e94\/@u03B8ZPt\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antisense oligonucleotides,Neuropilins,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16646"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andre Maaske<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Kirchhammer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Festag<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Fernandez Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mélanie Buchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monika Schell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Raith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sven Michel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Klar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alfred Zippelius<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Jaschinski<\/i><\/presenter>.

The conversion of inflammatory extracellular ATP into immunosuppressive adenosine invokes signaling of the A2a receptor (A2AR) in the tumor microenvironment. This dampens immune responses and creates a pro-tumor niche. A number of novel IO drugs targeting the adenosine pathway through inhibition of the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 or the A2AR\/BR are in clinical trials, including our non-CNS penetrant A2AR-selective antagonist, EXS21546 (NCT04727138). While early clinical results from other adenosine receptor-inhibitors (A2ARi) have shown modest monotherapy activity in nonspecific patient populations, we believe greater success can be achieved by leveraging methods that enable the evaluation of single-cell effects in patient samples preclinically. Using our deep learning driven image analysis platform, we define an adenosine-induced, tumor protective immunosuppression biomarker to augment A2AR antagonist responder identification.<br \/>Here we describe efforts to transcriptionally and functionally map the adenosine suppressed immune potential and activation by inhibition of A2AR with EXS21546 in primary material. The goal is to reveal gene signatures indicative of adenosine immunosuppression deployable in clinical studies, increasing the likelihood of trial success by identifying patients that have the highest efficiency potential for A2AR targeted therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Leveraging patient material as disease relevant model systems, and collecting baseline and treatment condition transcriptomics, we model the patient specific anti-cancer immune repertoire and validate patient selection methods functionally with a translatable high content imaging platform amenable to primary human material supported by end-to-end deep learning driven image analysis.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Combining single cell transcriptomic and functional response data, we demonstrate preclinical mechanistic studies of A2AR antagonism on infiltrating immune cells, with the ultimate aim of discovering predictive algorithms to enrich patients more likely respond to adenosine pathway inhibitors. Patient selection gene signatures are functionally validated using a high content imaging platform with proven translational capabilities (Kornauth et al, Cancer Disc., 2021), demonstrating the association of anti-cancer immune activity with inhibition of adenosine signaling by EXS21546. Signatures and patient selection algorithms are cross-validated with publicly available data.<br \/><b>Discussion:<\/b> Gathering multiple layers of data from primary tumor tissues, we reveal and map the association of immune response potential to A2AR inhibition in cancer.<br \/>Patient stratification gene signatures identified have the aim to be implemented in future studies of our candidate A2ARi EXS21546, to deliver the right drug at the right time in the right patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3e7796be-3290-4965-af35-b6f2905254d7\/@u03B8ZPt\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,Biomarkers,Immuno-oncology,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16647"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isabella Alt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Shelke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Lobley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Baumgaertler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maja Stulic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre Fons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Whittaker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Klaus Hackner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucia Dzurillova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edga Petru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laudia Hadjari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Lafleur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josef Singer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikolaus Krall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukas Hefler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thorsten Füreder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Taubert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Boudesco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Payne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Ian Vladimer<\/i><\/presenter>.

Serum conjugated antibody (cAb) and total antibody (tAb) were quantified by a validated chemoimmunoluminescence assay. Soluble CD25 was quantified by a qualified enzyme-linked immunoassay. Circulating immune cell absolute counts were assessed by flow cytometry for T<sub>regs<\/sub> (FoxP3+CD25+CD127<sub>low<\/sub>) as a fraction of absolute CD4+ cells, T<sub>eff<\/sub> (CD8+), and T<sub>eff<\/sub>:T<sub>reg<\/sub>. Statistical analyses were performed using a linear mixed-effects model (maximum likelihood) for the biomarker effects model with cAb area under the curve (AUC) during cycle 1, therapy (monotherapy vs combination), and treatment cycle as fixed effects and log AUC slope with intercept by subject or visit day as random effects.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>PK analysis found C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC of cAb and tAb increased during cycles 1 and 2 with Cami monotherapy and combination therapy across the range of doses. Variability of AUC<sub>inf<\/sub> for cAb in cycle 1 appeared modest to marked across discrete dose groups (CV=14.7-98.1%). The clearance of cAb ranged from 1.34 to 3.52 L\/day in cycle 1 with no apparent differences between monotherapy and combination therapy. Biomarker modeling demonstrated that cAb AUC and cycle were associated with a significant T<sub>regs<\/sub> depletion and a significant positive effect on T<sub>eff<\/sub>:T<sub>reg<\/sub> ratio but with no relevant effect on T<sub>eff<\/sub>. Within cycle, treatment-related modulation of T<sub>eff<\/sub> and T<sub>regs<\/sub> was observed for all doses and conditions. Soluble CD25 appears to be significantly positively affected by cycle 2 treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>PK exposure of Cami was dose-related with varying degrees of interpatient variability. Circulating T<sub>regs<\/sub> were significantly decreased and T<sub>eff<\/sub>:T<sub>reg<\/sub> was significantly increased by Cami exposure, demonstrating the intended immunomodulatory effect of Cami in circulation and suggesting that a combination approach with Cami could address an immune-resistance mechanism. Future analyses will consider discrete PEM effect, correlates to tumor biopsy expression and response, and combined Cami+PEM effect in tumor biopsies.

Given the high percentage of cancer patients with co-existing atherosclerosis due to many shared risk factors, the development of novel cancer therapeutic agents with strong anti-tumor efficacy and therapeutic benefit on atherosclerosis can significantly improve the outcome of cancer therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy using therapeutic antibodies has shown promises in the treatment of several types of human cancers. However, many cancer patients showed a poor response due to low delivery efficiency, lack of effector T cells, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and intrinsic resistance in solid tumors. Increasing numbers of patients developed immunotherapy related adverse effects (irAEs). It is well known that macrophages and effector T cells drive the progression of atherosclerosis. Recent clinical studies revealed that cancer patients received ICI therapy have 3-fold higher risk of atherosclerosis and 3-fold increases in plaque progression detected by PET imaging. <b> <\/b>To enhance therapeutic efficacy of tumor immunotherapy and decrease irAEs, we have developed a hyaluronic acid nanoparticle (HANP) conjugated with PD1 mimetic peptides that target and block PD-L1 function, and encapsulated with Avasimibe (PD1Y-HANP\/Ava). Avasimibe is a multifunctional agent that decreases cholesterol accumulation, inhibits tumor growth, and enhances immune response by activating cytotoxic T cells. We found that systemic administrations of PD1Y-HANP\/Ava led to targeted delivery into tumors and atherosclerotic plaques in a dual colon cancer and atherosclerosis mouse model, established by injecting mouse colon tumor cells into Apoe<sup> <\/sup>knockout mice on a high fat diet. PD1Y-HANP\/Ava treatments resulted in 78% of tumor growth inhibition. Following surgical resection of residual tumors, 80% of PD1Y-HANP\/Ava treated mice had disease-free survival of &#62;120 days and were protected from tumor growth after tumor cell re-challenging. Histological analysis of the major arteries revealed that the volume of atherosclerotic plaques decreased 70% in the mice treated with PD1Y-HANP\/Ava compared the no-treated mice. Our results showed that PD1Y-HANP\/Ava treatment increased infiltration of CD8+ T effector and dendritic cells, and activated cytotoxic T cells in mouse colon tumors. Colon tumor specific antibodies were detected in the mouse serum following PD1Y-HANP\/Ava treatment. However, the levels of CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages were decreased in the atherosclerotic plaques, which could prevent ICI-induced cardiovascular irAEs. Results of this study should provide us with preclinical evidence for translational development of targeted immunotherapy for colon cancer patients with comorbid atherosclerosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6c8341dc-7474-4cd4-8396-57b801ab4379\/@v03B8ZPu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Nanoparticle,Cardiotoxicity,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16649"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lei Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiping Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minglong Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tongrui Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles A.

Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules present peptides that are recognised by both CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells and NK cells, and these complexes play a vital role in the recognition and eradication of malignant cells. During direct presentation, the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) enzyme processes a subset of HLA-I ligand precursors which are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following intracellular proteasomal degradation. Here, we show that inhibition of ERAP1 with highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitors drives significant qualitative and quantitative changes in the HLA-I-restricted immunopeptidome, resulting in the generation of altered and novel peptides from tumour-associated antigens that are then presented on HLA-I molecules. A major consequence of inhibiting the processing of precursor ligands by ERAP1 within the ER of cancer cells was not only the generation of unique peptides which were not detectable under baseline conditions, but a shift in the peptide length distribution towards longer HLA-I-restricted peptides. Importantly, we demonstrate that the degree of bias towards longer HLA-I-bound ligands uniquely presented following ERAP1 inhibition was governed by both ERAP1 and HLA-I haplotypes. Such dramatic changes in the peptide repertoire presented for immune recognition have the potential to enhance anti-tumoural immunogenicity through T cell recognition of a novel cancer immunopeptidome, and, in addition to global shifts in the peptide length distributions, unique peptides presented for immune recognition during ERAP1 inhibition may be used as biomarkers for monitoring activity of this novel therapeutic approach in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a04b894f-a79a-482b-8a88-920308819363\/@v03B8ZPu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endoplasmic reticulum,HLA class I,Immuno-oncology,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16652"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wayne Paes<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Leishman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kate Anderton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanqing Liao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isaac Woodhouse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Parker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annalisa Nicastri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Joyce<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicola Ternette<\/i><\/presenter>.

Activation of CD40, expressed on myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and tumor infiltrating macrophages, leads to improved T cell priming and initiation of T cell-dependent anti-tumor responses. Mitazalimab is a Fc&#947;R crosslinking-dependent IgG1 antibody, with potential for high efficacy and manageable safety profile.<br \/>Immunologically cold and immune-excluded tumors, such as pancreatic cancer, are defined by low infiltration of immune cells as well as low expression and release of neoantigens. In pancreatic cancer, effector CD8+ T cells are excluded from the tumor by the desmoplastic tumor stroma, which surrounds the tumor and hosts immunosuppressive macrophages that dampen the immune response in the tumor microenvironment. By activating and re-directing tumor infiltrating myeloid cells, CD40 agonists such as mitazalimab, have the potential to augment the response to chemotherapy and spark an effective anti-tumor response by i) priming T cells reactive to the tumor neoantigens released by the chemotherapy, and ii) inducing degradation of the stroma surrounding the tumor thereby enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy.<br \/>The ability of mitazalimab to augment the response to chemotherapy was demonstrated in mice, transgenic for human CD40 (hCD40tg), inoculated with the syngeneic tumor cell line MB49. Mitazalimab, administered repeatedly together with FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid), synergized effectively with chemotherapy, inducing long-term survival. The combined treatment improved activation of antigen presenting cells in the circulation, intratumoral T cell responses as well as reduced the amount of intratumoral immunosuppressive M2 macrophages. By converting the MB49 tumor cell line resistant to FOLFIRINOX treatment, we could further demonstrate that the combination of mitazalimab and FOLFIRINOX induced a strong anti-tumor activity also in a chemoresistant variant of the MB49 cell line.<br \/>In conclusion, mitazalimab synergizes effectively with chemotherapy, leading to induction of long-term survival in a preclinical tumor model by reducing immunosuppressive M2 macrophages and improving T cell responses intratumorally. These preclinical data, together with the clinical data of mitazalimab from the phase 1 study (NCT02829099), where mitazalimab was well tolerated up to 1200 &#956;g\/kg with a manageable safety profile, support the ongoing clinical phase 2 study OPTIMIZE-1 (NCT04888312) of mitazalimab in combination with chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd830b05-9456-4301-882e-a63bcc14013b\/@v03B8ZPu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD40,Chemotherapy,Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16654"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Karin Enell Smith<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mia Thagesson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anneli Nilsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Doreen Werchau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Ellmark<\/i><\/presenter>.

While the cellular expression of TNFR1 is broad, TNFR2 expression is mainly restricted to immune cells. The therapeutic potential of targeting TNFR2 for cancer treatment has been previously indicated and to gain further insight, we generated a wide panel of TNFR2-specific antibodies using the n-CoDeR F.I.R.S.T&#8482; target and antibody discovery platforms. We identified antibodies against mouse or human TNFR2 that could block TNF-&#945; binding and showed potent anti-tumor activity in several immune-competent models, both as single agent and in combination with anti-PD1. The mechanism-of-action was shown to be Fc&#947;R dependent and likely mediated through a combination of intra-tumor T reg depletion, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell expansion and modulation of innate immune cells e.g. neutrophils and myeloid cells. Toxicological studies of the human lead-candidate BI-1808 in non-human primates (NHP) demonstrated very good tolerability at doses up to 200 mg\/kg, and in vitro studies with human cells showed no signs of harmful cytokine release. Furthermore, in vivo studies using immune competent mouse cancer experimental models showed a clear relationship between dose, receptor occupancy (RO) and efficacy. In both murine models and in the NHPs, soluble TNFR2 was clearly modulated by the treatment and closely correlated with RO. In addition, several changes in the immune cells (e.g. T cells and neutrophils) in the blood compartment were observed. Since January 2021, BI-1808 is evaluated in an ongoing Phase I\/IIa trial. Similar to the preclinical studies, correlations between dose, RO and soluble TNFR2 has been clearly observed in the patients. In addition, and consistent with TNF-&#945;:TNFR biology being conserved across the species, modulations of T cell and neutrophil numbers are also paralleled between the patients, NHPs and mice, increasing the likelihood of successful clinical translation of our findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2d64d299-3653-4c7f-b5fc-41c847a2bdb2\/@v03B8ZPu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Antibody,TNF-&#945;,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16655"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Linda Mårtensson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirsty Cleary<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petra Holmkvist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathilda Kovacek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolin Svensson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monika Semmrich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Therese Blidberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mimoza Demiri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Osman Dadas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Borggren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vici Pitic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean H.

We have developed a novel immunotherapy platform that could be used to generate geographically focused cancer cell growth inhibition or immune cell activation, thereby stimulating an anti-tumor immune response against primary solid tumors that can also travel to secondary metastases.<br \/>Methods: Using published methods, we synthesized multivalent protein (MVP) conjugates by conjugating multiple copies (i.e. valency) of immune stimulating proteins, checkpoint inhibitors or anti-tumor antibodies to soluble, long-chain biopolymers. We verified that we can reproducibly generate MVP valencies ranging from 20-120 protein copies (&#177;10%) per polymer backbone. We determined the binding affinity of these MVPs to their respective targets<i> <\/i>using biolayer interferometry and cell bioassays, and we measured the hydrodynamic radius of these immunotherapies using dynamic light scattering. Then, we injected fluorescently modified MVPs or their unconjugated counterparts directly into a variety of solid tumor models in mice. By taking longitudinal <i>in vivo<\/i> fluorescence measurements of the intratumoral (IT) drug signal over multiple days, we measured the IT half-life of each treatment.<br \/>Results: Based on binding affinity measurements, we found that MVP potency increased directly with protein valency, and at high valency, the potency of MVPs were substantially greater than the unconjugated protein controls. Multivalent conjugation also increased the hydrodynamic radius of the MVPs to at least ten times larger than the unconjugated therapeutics. This large size was sufficient to slow the diffusion of MVP immunotherapies through dense tissues, such as solid tumors, as demonstrated by our <i>in vivo <\/i>studies. MVPs exhibited a higher IT drug signal with a more durable gradient within the tumor compared to the unconjugated controls, resulting in an extension of their IT half-lives by &#62;5X in mouse solid tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: The MVP platform can be used to modulate the potency and therapeutic durability for a wide range of immunotherapy targets. Further, the MVPs stay focused within the tumor after IT injection where they could generate a sustained anti-tumor immune response with minimal systemic exposure. Therefore, we expect MVP immunotherapies to have a better safety profile than IT or systemic delivery of an unconjugated therapeutic. We will continue to develop our internal MVP pipeline to finalize a candidate for IND-enabling studies. We are also seeking collaborations for co-development of additional immunotherapies that could benefit from the extended IT exposure and potency modulation enabled by the MVP platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ab920ba3-f86d-4426-bd5f-aa10866b8d20\/@w03B8ZPv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Antibody,Tumor targeting,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16656"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Livia Brier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Amy A.

Sipuleucel T (sip T) is an autologous active cellular immunotherapy approved by FDA for patients with mCRPC and has been shown effective in improving overall survival (OS) among individuals with mCRPC. To date, detailed analysis of the sip T product has not been studied using an advanced mass cytometry approach. Here, we present high dimensional data describing the specific leukocyte subsets and phenotype of sip-T in detail.<br \/>Methods: We performed a comprehensive assessment of sip T (n=14 samples, collected under an IRB approved protocol) from 11 different patients with mCRPC, using high-throughput mass cytometry (CyTOF) comprised of 37 different antibodies\/markers. Sip T samples were then analyzed for various leukocyte subsets, as well as markers of activation and exhaustion. Furthermore, clinical correlations were drawn between immune cell subsets\/markers and patient clinical data such, as prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels.<br \/>Results: CyTOF analysis revealed that CD3+ T cells (including CD4+ and CD8+) constituted the highest proportion (median, range: 63%, 9-89%) of sip T, followed by CD19+ B cells (4%, 1-82%), CD3-CD14-CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells (4%, 1-18%), and CD3-CD19-CD56-HLA-DR+CD11c+CD14+ monocytes (1%, 1-37%) besides a small proportion (&#60;1%) of conventional dendritic cells (cDC), innate lymphoid cells (ILC), plasmacytoid DC (pDC), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and NK T-cells (NKT). The majority of CD8+ T cells were either CD45RA+CCR7-effector (Teff: 43%, 9-70%), CD45RA-CCR7- effector memory (Tem: 23%, 11-59%) and CD45RA+CCR7+ naive (Tn: 22%, 4-50%). Contrarily, most CD4+ T cells belonged to CD45RA-CCR7+ central memory (Tcm: 45%, 24-78%), effector memory (Tem: 27%, 6-61%) and naive (Tn: 22%, 1-50%) subtypes. Interestingly, the majority of monocytes (86%, 78-97%) were CD86+ suggesting a role in inducing lymphocyte activation. Of activation\/exhaustion markers, the highest proportion of PDL1+, PD1+, IFNg+ and ICOS+ cells were observed in monocytes, cDC, NK and CD4+ T cells respectively. Likewise, CTLA4+, VISTA+ and TIGIT+ cells were most commonly found among CD8+ T cells, suggesting a potential regulatory effect on sip T CD8+ T cell proliferation and effector function.<br \/>Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive study to evaluate the composition of sip T from mCRPC patients using high dimensional CyTOF analysis. Given the increasing use of CyTOF in translational research, this data set serves as an important reference source, which could be used in future studies to help guide therapeutic modulation of activation\/exhaustion markers to improve sip T efficacy and enhance beneficial immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a1172f2d-705d-48ce-9db4-d4cb2b649497\/@w03B8ZPv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Prostate cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16657"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Muhammad Saeed<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ariel Borkowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Russell Kent Pachynski<\/i><\/presenter>.

Contrasting to mRNA based vectors, self amplifying mRNA platforms may offer dose-sparing and superior induction of T cell responses, and may also trigger distinct innate immune pathways, which may exert adjuvanting or inhibiting effects on vaccine-induced immunity. Optimal dosing for a novel <b><u>s<\/u><\/b>elf-<b><u>a<\/u><\/b>mplifying <b><u>m<\/u><\/b>RNA (SAM) in a heterologous prime-boost vaccination approach consisting of Chimpanzee Adenovirus (ChAd) prime and SAM boosts was evaluated in two first-in-human phase 1\/2 clinical trials assessing personalized neoantigen vaccines in patients with metastatic cancer (NCT03639714, NCT03953235). SAM vaccine dose escalation was performed to assess safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity, including administration of up to 8 SAM doses at 30, 100, or 300&#181;g following a fixed dose of ChAd (10<sup>12<\/sup> vp) over the course of a year. SAM was safe and well tolerated at all 3 dose levels, with no evidence of increasing reactogenicity with sequential doses. However, while immune monitoring via IFN&#947; ELISpot revealed that the 30&#181;g SAM dose boosted T cell responses induced by the ChAd prime, the 100&#181;g and 300&#181;g SAM doses resulted in maintenance of T cell levels, without a clear T cell boost, suggesting a non-linear and likely bell-shaped dose-response curve to SAM in humans. Follow-up studies in non-human primates (NHPs) using a model antigen revealed dose-dependent increases in serum IFNa levels following administration of increasing SAM doses. Similarly, while multiple inflammatory cytokines were transiently increased following both ChAd and SAM administration in patients, serum IFNa levels were only increased 24h post SAM administration and correlated positively with SAM dose. Increased IFNa levels post SAM dosing suggested activation of mRNA-sensing innate immune pathways that may reduce the amplification of, and\/or antigen expression by, the SAM vector and thus blunt T cell boosting at higher SAM doses. In addition, analysis of T cell responses in patients and NHPs showed increased boosting of T cell responses with longer intervals. These data lead to a reduction of the SAM dose to 30&#181;g and adjusting SAM dosing intervals to 8 weeks in the Phase 2 portion of these clinical studies. Multiple patients have been dosed with the adjusted vaccine regimen, and preliminary data suggest robust boosting of ChAd-induced neoantigen-specific T cell responses with the selected SAM dosing regimen and the 30&#181;g dose.

There have been examples of mutated, short self-peptides inducing epitope-specific CD8&#8314; T cells more efficiently than the wild-type epitope, but current approaches cannot yet reliably generate such enhanced mimotopes (&#8220;e-mimotopes&#8221;). Here, we present a generalized strategy to develop e-mimotopes, using the tyrosinase-related protein 2 peptide Trp2<sub>180-188<\/sub>, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I&nbsp;epitope, as a test case. Using a vaccine adjuvant that induces peptide particle formation and strong cellular responses with nanogram antigen doses, a two-step method systematically identified e-mimotope candidates with murine immunization. First, position-scanning peptide micro libraries were generated in which each position of the wild-type epitope sequence was randomized. Randomization of only one specific residue of the Trp2 epitope increased anti-tumor immunogenicity. Second, all 20 amino acids were individually substituted and tested at that position, enabling the identification of two e-mimotopes with single amino acid mutations. Despite similar MHC-I affinity compared to the wild-type epitope, e-mimotope immunization elicited improved Trp2-specific cytotoxic T cell phenotypes and improved T cell receptor affinity for both the e-mimotopes and the native epitope, resulting in better outcomes in multiple prophylactic and therapeutic tumor models. The screening method was also applied to other targets with different murine MHC-I restriction elements, including the gp70 AH1 epitope, to identify additional e-mimotopes with enhanced potency.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Vaccines,Liposomes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16662"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xuedan He<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Understanding the efficacy of these agents involves more than just the characterization of patient-specific tumor cells, but also the supporting cells, such as immune cells, that encompass the tumor microenvironment (TME). Typically, selection of cancer therapy involves evaluation of the genomic landscape and expression profiling of the tumor cells alone. However, the composition of the TME has been shown to be a critical determinant in patient response to immune modulators. Thus, <i>ex vivo<\/i> profiling of ICI response for functional precision medicine should include a platform that provides a working replica of the patient&#8217;s TME. We have developed a model utilizing all cells resident in a patient&#8217;s tumor to engineer 3D spheroids for ICI response profiling. To highlight the importance of the TME, we sought to detect PD-1 inhibitor efficacy using tumor tissue from a cancer patient whose immune cells express PD-L1, but tumor cells are negative for PD-L1 and positive for MHC class I and II. To determine the role of immune and stromal cells in response to PD-1 inhibitor, we treated spheroids that were depleted of EpCAM+ cells. While PD-1 inhibitor increased cytosolic interferon gamma (IFN&#947;) and granzyme B in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, the degree of response was decreased in the CD8+ T-cells suggesting CD4+ T-cell response is tumor cell independent but still regulated via the PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling axis. To test the effect of MHC class I and class II in response to PD-1 inhibitor, MHC class I and class II blockade experiments were conducted. Only MHC class II blockade had a negative effect on CD4+ T-cell granzyme B expression, but that effect was abrogated by treatment with PD-1 inhibitor. MHC class I and II blockade individually blocked any impact of PD-1 inhibitor upon granzyme B expression in CD8+ T-cells. We then measured T-cell activation and cytokine secretion in relation to tumor cell killing following PD-1 inhibitor treatment. We found substantially increased CD25 on T-cells over the course of 96 hours but only modestly increased CD69 at 24 hours and 48 hours. Furthermore, we observed a concentration dependent increase in granzyme B and IFN&#947; secretion that peaked at 72 hours. We found treatment decreased EpCAM+ tumor cells at timepoints after 24 hours. These data demonstrate response from PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade can be elicited in a tumor cell independent manner indicating a role for the TME in ICI efficacy. This work provides evidence that <i>ex vivo<\/i> recreation of the TME is critical to detect and accurately predict patient response to ICI therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0783c9f5-df12-4332-a82d-2d894358fce1\/@w03B8ZPv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,3D cell culture,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16663"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kathryn M.
