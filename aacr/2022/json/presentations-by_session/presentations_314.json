[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Incorporating gene fusions into a comprehensive profile is critical not only because very effective therapies targeting oncogenic fusion proteins exist but they may also negate the response to therapy of an actionable SNV and InDel mutations. We examined the co-occurrence of actionable gene fusions detected by RNA-seq with actionable SNVs\/InDels and with the immunotherapy response biomarker, PD-L1.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In 2021, 5341 FFPE samples were analyzed by our clinical laboratory using a novel hybridization-based RNA sequencing assay. DNA (SNV\/Indels) mutations were detected with a clinical grade NGS assay and PD-L1 protein expression was determined by IHC using an appropriate LDT or FDA approved assay. De-identified data were analyzed following an approved IRB protocol.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of the 5341 patients tested for gene fusions only 0.7% were profiled with a comprehensive fusion detection panel for 250 clinically relevant fusion genes. Conversely, 67% of all patients were tested only for NTRK gene fusions. The prevalence of the following most relevant fusions was: ALK=3.16% (in particular EML4-ALK), NTRKs=0.85%, FGFR2=5.60%, RET=1.34% and ROS1=1.05%. Among NTRK fusions, NTRK3 was detected in 52.9% of the positive cases; in particular, dominant fusions are ETV6-NTRK3 (26%) and EML4-NTRK3 (20%). In the 163 fusion positive cases, 37 cases had available DNA mutation testing and PD-L1 expression testing. These patients presented 24 different actionable fusions, including ALK (2), FGFR1\/2 (5), NTRK 1\/2\/3 (10), NRG1 (3), RET (3), and ROS1 (3) fusions. Interestingly, while 73% (27\/37) of those tumors were PD-L1 positive, similar to the 75% found on the fusion negative samples, PD-L1 was positive in 88% (15\/17) of the lung samples with pathogenic mutations from this subset. This was strikingly higher than the 45% (192\/424) found in the fusion negative cohort. Finally, excluding TP53 mutations, NTRK fusions frequently co-occurred with RNF43, FBXW7, TERT promoter, and ARID1A pathogenic mutations. FGFR fusions co-occurred with BAP1, PBRM1, or KRAS mutations, which correlates with the fact that both FGFR2 fusions and swi\/snf alterations are enriched in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, where the FGFR fusions were detected. RET fusions co-occurred with ARID1A and TERT. ROS1 fusions co-occurred with SMARCA4 and KRAS pathogenic mutations simultaneously. NRG1 fusions co-occurred with ARID1A and FBXW7 mutations. EML4-ALK fusions co-occurred with FGFR2 and KMT2D variants of unknown significance.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Actionable cancer-driving gene fusions were detected by RNA-sequencing and co-occurred with other biomarkers that can guide the selection of therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and olaparib. The data suggest that gene fusion testing is an important addition to the genomic profiling for therapy selection in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/81b5418c-663e-4fe6-aabc-d168174ee1de\/@B03B8ZBu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion genes,Actionable biomarkers,FDA-approved PD-L1 detection,Solid Tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12667"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Miyoung Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paris Petersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Lau-Rivera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Segun Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sally Agersborg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacyln Hechtman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Fernando Lopez-Diaz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Funari<\/i><\/presenter>.

Importantly, not all breast cancer patients respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), leading to an incomplete pathological response and suggesting that there are tumor characteristics that may explain the differences in response. The overarching goal of this study is to identify gene expression profiles associated with an incomplete pathological response to NAC in Colombian women with invasive BC.<br \/><b>Design:<\/b> An integrative transcriptome analysis using Illumina high-throughput RNA sequencing was performed from 63 baseline and post-NAC (follow-up) paraffin-embedded samples from 46 different female patients with locally advanced BC (stage IIB to IIIC) treated at the Colombian National Cancer Institute. Gene expression data were obtained from 42 baseline and 21 follow-up samples. Two comparison analyses were conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) first comparing baseline vs follow-up samples from nonresponders to NAC and second comparing to baseline samples from nonresponders vs responders to NAC. Additionally, enrichment analyses were performed in both comparative analyses.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> From 46 patients included, 20 had a pathological complete response (pCR), while 26 did not show pCR. By investigating the gene expression profiling, 1546 significantly DEGs and 174 DEGs were identified among non-responders and Baseline analyses, respectively. From these analyses, 24 DEGs were found in common and apoptosis as the only shared enrichment pathway (p=0.001). In both analyses, Histone associated genes were downregulated in nonresponders (Histone 3, <i>p<\/i>=0,001 and Histone 2B, p&#60;0,001). In addition, downregulation of Granzyme B and perforin were also found differentially expressed in apoptosis network pathways. CD8+ na&#239;ve T-cells, hematopoietic stem cells, Macrophages, Macrophages M1, Neurons, Th1 cells, activated dendritic cells and pro B cells were defined by the xCell algorithm and showed statistically significant association with non-response to NAC.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Changes in histones and tumor microenvironment cell populations elicits local immune response, which contributed to therapeutic efficacy. Downregulation of Granzyme B and perforin could block mechanism of resistance to carcinogenesis, leading to non-response to NAC. Furthermore, patients with tumors containing higher gene signatures of these DEGs may benefit from NAC. Additional validations are needed to confirm these data. If confirmed, these data may be relevant in elucidating the mechanisms that lead to therapy resistance as well as in selecting patients that will benefit from NAC in Latino (Colombian) patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0fb38637-b4f6-46cf-8c23-09e4f4dd3c97\/@B03B8ZBu\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Biomarkers,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12670"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hedda Michelle Guevara-Nieto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rafael Parra-Medina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Carlos Mejia-Henao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Eugenia López-Correa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>José Ismael Guío-Avila<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Diaz-Casas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jone Garai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jovanny Zabaleta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liliana López-Kleine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alba Lucia Cómbita<\/i><\/presenter>.

The use of long-term outcomes such as progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) to inform early drug development can extend timelines and delay approval of potentially beneficial novel treatments. Establishing correlations between short-term treatment effects and long-term outcomes could shorten development timelines. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a sensitive indicator of disease burden, with achievement of undetectable MRD (uMRD: &#60; 1 CLL in 10,000 leukocytes [10<sup>-4<\/sup>]) either during or at the end of therapy being prognostic of prolonged PFS and OS. Our current work explores correlations between PFS and earlier dynamic changes in lymphocyte counts and peripheral blood (PB) MRD as potential tools for guiding drug development decisions in CLL.<br \/>Data from five trials (NCT numbers 01328626, 01889186, 02141282, 02756611 (receiving Venetoclax monotherapy and primarily R\/R CLL pts) and 01682616 (R\/R CLL pts receiving venetoclax + rituximab therapy) were analyzed. PB MRD was quantified by either flow cytometry or next generation sequencing at various timepoints. Many of these pts had high risk features such as 17pDEL or prior BCRi therapy. The relationships between absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and percent change in lymphocytes at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months (M) of treatment and PB MRD status were explored. Additionally, the relationship between PB MRD levels at 6&#177;2 M and achievement of uMRD was assessed. Lastly, we evaluated the relationship between PB MRD status at different time points (6&#177;2, 9 and 12 M) and PFS using Kaplan Meier plots.<br \/>Across the trials, 708 CLL pts were treated, with 496 pts having PB MRD assessments at any time on therapy. PB uMRD rate of the evaluable population was 47.6% (236\/496). Analysis of pts with PB MRD assessments at ~6 M (6&#177;2 M, n=310) demonstrated that achievement of uMRD correlated with improved PFS (with median PFS of 56 M compared to 26 M in pts who had detectable MRD, <i>p<\/i>=0.037). Moreover, pts with residual disease in the PB (<u>&#62;<\/u> 10<sup>-4<\/sup>) at ~6 M and achieved uMRD later while on therapy had a significantly lower residual disease at this timepoint than pts who did not achieve uMRD (p&#60;0.001). Pts with residual disease &#60; 10<sup>-3<\/sup> (&#60;1 CLL cell \/ 1,000 leukocytes) at ~6 M were more likely to demonstrate PB uMRD at 12 M (72% vs 6%, p&#60;0.001) compared to pts with residual disease &#8805;10<sup>-3<\/sup> at this assessment. Neither ALC or percent change in lymphocytes at 1, 3, 6, and 9 M of treatment correlated with PB uMRD.<br \/>In this R\/R CLL population who received continuous dosing of venetoclax, uMRD at ~6 M correlated with PFS outcomes. Additionally, MRD levels at ~6 M of therapy correlated with uMRD at 12 M. These suggest that including PB MRD assessments at early timepoints may be a useful tool in assessing efficacy and informing RP2D decisions during the development of novel agents in this indication.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/481697f4-01ff-4669-9922-9cdb96310f07\/@B03B8ZBu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Bcl-2 protein family,Venetoclax,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12673"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ibrahim Y.

Establishment of predictive biomarkers for response to ICI maximizes the therapeutic benefit. Since no such marker exists, we investigated DC-HIL\/GPNMB as a possibility because we detected DC-HIL to be elevated in blood of patients with metastasis, as both a receptor on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and as a soluble form (sDC-HIL); and found DC-HIL to be relevant to ICI resistance in mice. We studied 27 mRCC patients treated with combination ICI (Ab to PD1\/PDL1\/CTLA4) and assessed tumor response (by RECIST) at 12 wk after therapy. Blood was collected before and after treatment and assayed by FACS for expression of DC-HIL and PDL1 on CD14<sup>+<\/sup>HLA-DR<sup>no\/lo<\/sup> monocytic (mMDSC) and CD15<sup>+<\/sup>CD11b<sup>+<\/sup> granulocytic MDSC (gMDSC). T-cell suppressor function was assayed by cell culture. We showed both MDSC subsets to express DC-HIL predominantly over PDL1. We also showed mMDSC to be more potent T-cell suppressors than gMDSC (85% vs. 58% suppression, <i>p<\/i>=0.012) and to also be more dependent on DC-HIL for such suppression (56% vs. 15% restoration of T-cell function after adding DC-HIL mAb, <i>p<\/i>=0.013). However, there was no significant difference in % DC-HIL<sup>+<\/sup>MDSC\/PBMC between ICI responders and non-responders (<i>p<\/i>=0.15). We next examined the relationship between tumor response (at 12 wk) and blood sDC-HIL (by ELISA) in 31 mRCC patients. At baseline, non-responders (n=10) had a significantly higher sDC-HIL than responders (n=21) (14 &#177; 2.4 vs. 10 &#177; 4.6 ng\/ml, <i>p<\/i>=0.004), but no difference in blood PDL1 or VEGF. Among initial responders (n=22), 50% maintained a positive response while the other half acquired resistance after 20 wk. Among initial non-responders (n=9), 77% never responded while 22% responded positively after 20 wk. We then analyzed changes over time in sDC-HIL levels after treatment (up to 60 wks) in individuals. Patients who responded positively to ICI at treatment inception and through 40 wk maintained blood sDC-HIL at levels lower than the median for all positive responders. Initial responders who acquired resistance (9 out of 11 patients) had low blood sDC-HIL that rose during cancer progression. All constant non-responders (n=7) had high blood sDC-HIL that remained high during the study. To our surprise, the 2 initial non-responders who responded positively after 20-40 wk of ICI displayed an abrupt rise in blood sDC-HIL during their positive response. Our results indicate blood sDC-HIL as a promising biomarker for prognosticating response to ICI in mRCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/12059dce-7aef-4600-8d5e-e6e955949236\/@C03B8ZBv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12674"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jin-Sung Chung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vijay Ramani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ponciano D.

Unlike IHC 22C3, which restricts assessment of PD-L1 expression to viable tumor cells as a tumor proportion score (% TPS), mRNA next generation sequencing (RNA-seq) measures PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment for both tumor and inflammatory background cells. RNA-seq previously demonstrated concordance with IHC and may be a robust alternative testing method for multiple tumor types. Here, we sought to optimize PD-L1 RNA-seq cutoff values in NSCLC to improve clinical sensitivity.<br \/><b>PROCEDURE:<\/b> NSCLC patients included in the study (n=3,465) were tested for PD-L1 expression by IHC 22C3 and clinically validated RNA-seq, measured as % rank (0-100) relative to a reference population based on normalized reads per million (nRPM). Patients were divided into an RNA-seq cut-off discovery cohort (n=3,168), and a test cohort pembrolizumab treated patients. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to classify patients based on test results and explore cut-off values in the discovery cohort. Kaplan Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazards regression models assessed overall survival (OS) hazard ratios (HR) for RNA-seq versus standard of care IHC cut-offs in the test cohort.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> Unsupervised PCA clustering identified three distinct PD-L1 groups separated by combinations of significant over- and under-representation of RNA-seq and IHC result measures from prior testing. The groups were labeled as &#8220;low&#8221; (rank &#8804;40), &#8220;moderate&#8221; (rank 41-73), and &#8220;high&#8221; (rank &#8805;74), based on the median RNA-seq rank for each group (+\/- 1SD for low and high). Both the low and moderate groups were overrepresented by patients in the PD-L1 IHC low and negative groups. The moderate group was overrepresented by patients with moderately high PD-L1 RNA-seq ranks (median=70), while the low group was overrepresented by patients that were not PD-L1 high by RNA-seq. The high group was overrepresented by patients high for PD-L1 by both IHC and RNA-seq. OS HRs were better for RNA-seq high versus moderate (HR=0.05, CI 0.00-0.63, p=.02), and RNA-seq high versus low (HR=0.16, CI 0.03-0.86, p=.03) groups compared to standard of care IHC 22C3 high versus low groups, (HR=0.21, CI 0.04-1.07, p=.06). Findings were non-significant for the RNA-seq moderate versus low groups, likely due to the limited and disproportionately high number of patients with poor performance status in these groups.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> PD-L1 expression by RNA-seq demonstrated improved clinical sensitivity in predicting OS versus standard of care PD-LI IHC in a pembrolizumab treated NSCLC patient cohort. Additional studies are needed to further define cut-offs in the context of performance status, and better understand immune escape mechanisms in the moderate group.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79903afd-540b-4416-bad6-2a15cbcf6d22\/@C03B8ZBv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),PD-L1,NSCLC,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12675"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mary K.

Therefore, identification of pre-treatment markers of response to anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is essential. Immune responses to infections and many autoimmune diseases exhibit gender bias, but it is not known if gender influences response to CAR T-cell therapy. We performed serum profiling to identify pre-treatment cytokines and chemokines associated with response and survival in male and female LBCL patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Serum samples were collected from peripheral blood at the time of leukapheresis from 42 R\/R LBCL patients treated with axi-cel. Multiplexed bead arrays were used to quantify baseline levels of 51 serum cytokines, chemokines and cytotoxic proteins. Unpaired Wilcoxon test was used to analyze the association of baseline cytokine levels with 3-month response, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for association with survival outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using R and <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05 was considered significant.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The median age of patients was 61 y, and 62% of the patients were male. All patients had been previously treated with R-CHOP or R-EPOCH, and had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy, including 47.6% with autologous stem cell transplantation. Male non-responders (stable\/progressive disease) had significantly higher baseline levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1RA, MIP-1&#945;, GM-CSF and CRP compared to responders (complete\/partial response). Higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-27, and CRP were significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS), and IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1&#946;, and CRP with poor progression-free survival (PFS) in male patients. Baseline metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were also significantly higher in male patients with poor OS and PFS. Finally, baseline IL-8 and CRP were significantly associated with baseline MTV and LDH levels in male patients.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data show that pre-treatment proinflammatory proteins IL-8, IL-6, CRP are associated with poor response and survival in axi-cel-treated male but not female LBCL patients.

For I-O sensitive BMs we recorded MSI-High status, TMB-High (<u>&#62;<\/u> 10 mut\/Mb) status, and mutations in <i>POLE<\/i>\/<i>POLD1<\/i>, <i>MLH1<\/i>, <i>MSH2<\/i>\/<i>3<\/i>\/<i>6<\/i>, <i>PMS1<\/i>\/<i>2<\/i>, <i>PD-L1<\/i>\/-<i>L2<\/i>, <i>CTLA4<\/i>, <i>CD28<\/i>, <i>ARID2<\/i>, and <i>PBRM1<\/i>.

However, recent studies show that only about half of patients respond to PSMA-TRTs. Expression of PSMA on cancer cells via PET-imaging is of some use as a predictive biomarker of response to PSMA-TRTs, but there are patients with strong PSMA imaging who do not respond and some with poor PSMA imaging that do respond. PSMA imaging does not fully capture response predictability. Currently, the lack of predictive biomarkers of response limits optimal selection of the patient population most likely to benefit from to PSMA-TRTs. PSMA-TRTs radionuclides emit &#945; or &#946; radiations, which induce DNA damage in targeted cells, followed by immunogenic cell death (ICD), evidenced by calreticulin (CRT) plasma membrane accumulation. To investigate the role of PSMA expression and CRT membrane localization as a biomarker of response to PSMA-TRT, we isolated circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with mCRPC, enrolled in a phase I dose escalation trial of 225Ac-J591 (NCT03276572). Thirty-two (32) patients were enrolled (median age 69. 5, range 52-89; PSA 149.1, range 4.8-7168); 78% and 68% of patients received &#8805; 2 prior ARPi treatments or chemotherapy, respectively. 69% and 44% of patients experienced any or &#62;50% PSA decline, respectively, with a median PFS of 5.1 months and median OS of 11.1 months. CTCs were isolated before treatment (baseline) from 30\/32 of enrolled patients, and 12 weeks after treatment initiation (on-treatment) from 21\/32 patients. Enriched CTCs via CD45 depletion were subsequently immunostained for cytokeratin (CK, standard epithelial marker), CD45 (standard marker to identify contaminating leukocytes), PSMA, calreticulin (CRT) and DAPI. CTCs were subjected to multiplex confocal microscopy and identified as CK<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD45<sup>-<\/sup>\/DAPI<sup>+<\/sup> cells. For each patient, at each time point, the following parameters are scored: i) total number of CTCs, ii) number of PSMA<sup>+<\/sup> CTCs, iii) number of CRT<sup>+<\/sup> CTCs, iv) number of CTCs with plasma membrane CRT decoration. Percent of PSMA<sup>+<\/sup> CTC at baseline and changes in percentage of CRT<sup>+<\/sup> CTCs and CTCs with plasma membrane CRT decoration between baseline and on treatment timepoints are correlated with clinical response and time to progression upon 225Ac-J591 treatment. Our preliminary results indicate higher expression of plasma membranous CRT in on-treatment CTCs in responders (PFS&#62;12 months; n= 39 CTCs from 3 patients) than in non-responders (PFS&#60;3 months; n= 20 CTCs from 2 patients). Full analysis of CRT and PSMA expression is currently being completed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7997b8f8-c1c0-4e5a-969b-33d511430231\/@C03B8ZBv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Circulating tumor cells,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Radioimmunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12680"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Giuseppe Galletti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prerna Vatsa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph R.

However, not all tumors with a PD-L1 expression and\/or CD8+ T cell infiltrate respond to ICB, and some tumors without any PD-L1 expression respond to ICB. Moreover, little is known about all the mechanisms governing ICB resistance in NSCLC. The objective of the study was to investigate a circulating immunological signature (cytokines, chemokines and immune checkpoints) which could be predictive of resistance to ICB in patients with advanced NSCLC. We performed a multiplexed analysis on 23 TruCulture&#174; (<i>in vitro<\/i> T cells activation system) and 41 plasma samples using the Luminex&#174; platform (Bio-Techne, MN USA). We investigated the relationship between the levels at baseline of 30 circulating analytes and the response to ICB of advanced NSCLC patients. Through the TruCulture&#174; samples analysis, we identified two types of responders depending on T cell functionality. The responders with a functional T cell activation had lower levels of neutrophil associated analytes (CXCL5\/6; p-value&#60;0.05) than non-responders. They had lower levels of IL-13 and higher levers of TNF&#945;, respectively Th2 and Th1\/CD8+\/NK associated analytes. All responders had lower levels of CCL17 and higher levels of CXCL10 in plasma samples, respectively M2\/N2 and M1\/N1 associated analytes. This study highlighted two distinct profiles of ICB responders. The first group has a functional T cell response with a favorable orientation to antitumor cytotoxic action (Th1\/CD8+) and few cytokines associated with neutrophils. The second group has a poor functional T cell response, whereas their favorable response to ICB is potentially linked to the activation of the innate immune response. The plasma study highlighted the potential role of polarization of the innate response in the context of the response to ICB for all patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d161785d-a9e7-44c6-bd3d-151a40ff924e\/@C03B8ZBv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Liquid biopsies,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12681"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Wassila Khatir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Humbert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaap Neels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Léa Berland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Benzaquen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabian Andrés Gallardo Rivera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maryline Allegra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myriam Salah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virginie Tanga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Bordone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Fayada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virginie Lespinet-Fabre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elodie Long-Mira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Lassalle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Brest<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valérie Vouret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlotte Maniel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacques Boutros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Heeke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Véronique Hofman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles-Hugo Marquette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Paul Hofman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marius Ilie<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here we studied the population dynamics of immune cells and immune phenotypic changes, using clinical blood samples and a multicolor flow cytometry analysis . These samples were serially obtained from a cohort of high-grade glioma canine patients enrolled in a trial with an immunotherapy that targets the CD200\/CD200R immunological synapse. This therapy consists of an alternative checkpoint inhibitor peptide (CD200AR-L) that modulates the CD200 immune checkpoint, currently being used in an adult phase I safety trial for recurrent glioblastoma trial (NCT04642937) and a canine high-grade spontaneous glioma trial (U01CA224160-01). We found evidence of a strong effect of the therapy on peripheral immune cells in responder versus nonresponder dogs. Upon initiation of therapy, immune effector cell proliferation increased in responsive patients, whereas in nonresponders immune cell populations either didn&#8217;t change significantly or an increase in immunosuppressive phenotypes was observed. Cell populations such as MDSC, regulatory T cells and exhausted T cells were predominantly higher in nonresponder dogs. These data showed that peripheral immune cell phenotypes were linked to the outcome of the immunotherapy, thus dogs with better immune cell profiles, including increased cytotoxic differentiation, had a better prognosis and longer overall survival rates. Taken together, these results suggest that variation in patient responsiveness can be explained by differences in peripheral immune cell proliferation and differentiation soon after the initiation of immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Immunotherapy,Immunomodulation,CD200,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12682"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Francisco W.

However, despite the clinical advances of ICI therapy no durable responses are observed in 40-60% of melanoma patients, and current biomarkers such as tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD-L1 expression do not clearly distinguish responders. Therefore, a growing focus of immuno-oncology (IO) research is focused on identifying novel biomarkers that are predictive for the response of treatment with ICIs. Due to the complexity of the interactions between cancer cells and the immune system, the identification of predictive biomarkers for patient response requires a combination of tools and efforts. Therefore, we have designed a multi-modality approach for the protein analysis of tumor tissue samples from late-stage melanoma patients treated with ICIs, consisting of an unbiased deep proteomic analysis followed by a multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) spatial tissue analysis.<br \/>Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples were firstly used for unbiased quantification of proteins using data-independent acquisition (DIA) LC-MS technology and Biognosys&#8217; Spectronaut software. Baseline patient samples were classified as responders (n = 9) or non-responders (n = 15) based on the response at 3 months post ICI-treatment. Additionally, patient&#8217;s tumor mutational burden (TMB) was analyzed using whole exome sequencing (WES). Subsequently, the same patient samples will be analyzed by MultiOmyx&#8482;, a proprietary, immunofluorescence (IF) multiplexing assay that enables visualization and characterization of up to 60 biomarkers on a single FFPE section. A custom panel will be generated to verify key markers identified by proteomics analysis in a spatial context and after multiplexing images will be analyzed by applying the proprietary deep-learning based cell classification platform NeoLYTX.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Analysis of the 24 FFPE samples from metastatic melanoma patients treated with ICI therapy stratified into responders and non-responders lead to the identification of 103 proteins that are significantly up- or down-regulated between the groups. Work is now ongoing to follow-up these findings by an mIF tissue analysis which will provide further details on the spatial relationship in the tumor microenvironment of these markers and pathways.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study we demonstrate the power of a dual proteomic and mIF profiling for a comprehensive characterization of melanoma patients and the discovery and detection of markers predictive for response to ICI-therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bfad82ee-1867-4070-8abf-c3ba00d8b536\/@C03B8ZBv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Response,Proteomic analysis,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12683"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Juncker-Jensen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nigel Beaton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristina Beeler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Treiber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Levesque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia M.

Primary management of sarcoma patients includes surgical resection with adjuvant or neoadjuvant radiation\/chemotherapy. Even with aggressive multimodal treatment regimens, patients with high-grade sarcomas experience suboptimal prognosis and advanced disease is almost universally fatal. Innovative biomarker driven targeted therapies are in urgent need to improve survival in these patients. Discoveries in molecular and genetic basis of sarcoma have revealed new targets that deserve consideration. Inactivation of retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway, which causes unabated cell proliferation, through overexpression of cyclin D1 and\/or CDK4\/6 has been detected in the majority of sarcomas even when wild-type Rb protein is expressed. Hence, inhibition of cell cycle progression through reactivation of the tumor suppressor function of Rb by inhibiting CDK4\/6 activity poses a potential avenue for new therapeutic options.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> A panel of 4 sarcoma cell lines and 4 patient derived xenograft (PDX) models were used: 2 with an intact Rb pathway (Rb+ve, p16-ve) and 2 with an altered Rb pathway (Rb low\/-ve, p16+ve). CDK4\/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, was used to reactivate the Rb pathway followed by treatment with gemcitabine or WEE1-kinase-inhibitor, to target the enriched S and G2\/M phase cells post-abemaciclib removal. <sup>18<\/sup>F-FLT PET imaging and serum thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) were used to monitor changes in cell proliferation and treatment response in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Changes in cell cycle biomarkers in response to treatment were also interrogated.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Rb+ve sarcoma cell lines were sensitive to the anti-proliferative activity of abemaciclib leading to their reversible G1 arrest, while Rb null cells did not arrest in any phase of cell cycle in response to CDK4\/6 inhibition. Following abemciclib removal, Rb+ve models (but not Rb-ve) showed significant increase in <sup>18<\/sup>F-FLT biotracer uptake concomitant with elevated serum TK1 and enrichment of cells in S phase. The enrichment of cells in S phase maximized therapeutic efficacy of S-phase or G2\/M targeting agents leading to synergistic cell killing in Rb+ve cell lines and PDX models.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study presents an innovative treatment strategy inhibiting the Rb pathway followed by S or G2\/M pathway sequentially resulting in synergistic cell killing in those cells\/tumors with wild-type Rb. We also incorporate real-time PET imaging and serum TK1 as non-invasive indicators of response to the treatment strategy. The study with PDX models also identified biomarkers of cell proliferation to be used in conjunction with PET imaging to provide the pre-clinical rationale to translate our findings into clinical trials for this aggressive disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3f103acf-3d44-4206-bd6c-9c1ccbb6f8ec\/@C03B8ZBv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,[18]FLT-PET\/CT ,Serum thymidine kinase 1 activity ,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12685"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tuyen Duong Thanh Nguyen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc A.

Likewise, we currently have no tools which would help identify the optimal choice of agents; current prescribing practice is not guided by any objective criteria. We have recently demonstrated that interrogating the serum glycoproteome, using a proprietary platform that couples artificial intelligence to targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry yields highly informative biomarkers for a range of use cases, including prediction of response to ICI treatment. We recently demonstrated this for metastatic malignant melanoma (MM). In the current study, we examined if we could also predict preferential response to individual ICIs.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: We carried out glycoproteomic analysis of pretreatment blood samples in advanced MM patients treated with pembrolizumab (P; n=24) or nivolumab-ipilimumab (N; n=11). Individual glycopeptide (GP)signatures derived from 67 serum proteins were analyzed and correlated with treatment, and progression-free survival (PFS).<br \/>Summary of New Data: Two response groups were defined based on PFS: early failures (EF; PFS event within 6 months) and sustained control (SC; no events for &#8805; 12 months). Differential relative abundances for 498 serum GPs were calculated between SC and EF patients to determine GPs more abundant in SC vs. EF by treatment group. A score was developed for each treatment group based on the 20 GPs within each treatment group identified as most statistically significant (one-sided Wilcoxon test). For any patient, the score is the proportion of GPs with relative abundance exceeding their median abundance. A low score is associated with high risk for EF. When examined in all patients in the cohort (regardless of treatment), both scores isolated EF from SC. Only 2 glycopeptides overlapped between the treatment group scores, suggesting that the information is indeed drug specific. Algorithmic assignment was performed by choosing the treatment with the highest treatment-specific score (e.g., if N- score &#62; P-score, then assign to N). PFS was superior for cases where the assigned treatment matched the treatment received. Log-rank p-values comparing PFS by assigned treatment within P- and N -treated cases were 0.009 and 0.0004, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results show that a proprietary serum glycoproteomic analytical approach can guide individualized treatment assignment to the most likely successful agent among different ICIs. This could importantly improve the clinical use of immuno-therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b07c00b4-bc6f-4ff2-9871-c929e4c1b31d\/@D03B8ZBw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12688"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Klaus Lindpaintner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gege Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Rice<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Mitchell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennie Frederick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Genevieve Boland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Seie<\/i><\/presenter>.

As the majority of mUC patients do not survive to a second line of therapy, optimization of first line therapy is critical, especially with recently approved non-ICI therapeutics. The IO Score, a 27-gene TIME classifier, has previously demonstrated a strong association with response to ICI therapy in mUC (IMvigor210; n= 348), NSCLC, renal cancer and a randomized TNBC trial (NeoTRIPaPDL1; n= 258).<br \/>In a real-world study of ICI therapy in mUC pts (UNC-108), clinical benefit was seen in less than 30% of patients (Rose, 2021). The IO Score was evaluated for efficacy to ICI in this cohort to confirm findings from IMvigor210 where the IO Score was both independent and complementary to TMB.<br \/>Methods: The previously defined IO score algorithm was applied to available RNAseq data from 77 patients in the UNC-108 study. Using a six-week front censor for OS, Cox proportional hazards for OS, and PFS, the IO Score, TMB, and TMB and\/or IO Score positivity were calculated.

EDTA-plasma and urine supernatant were collected before start of treatment (day 1; &#8220;baseline&#8221;), before each subsequent treatment cycle (day 22 and 43) and before radical surgery. WES was performed on tumor FFPE and peripheral blood germline DNA to identify somatic variants for designing patient-specific, multiplex PCR-based NGS RaDaR&#8482; panels. Plasma and urine ctDNA was analyzed using these panels to determine ctDNA detection and its estimated variant allele frequency (eVAF). Tissue somatic variants were detected in all patients, a median of 48 variants was used per RaDaR&#8482; panel (range: 43-51). ctDNA was detected in 50\/94 plasma samples (53%) and in 74\/93 urine samples (80%). Detection levels were higher in urine with a median eVAF of 1.98% (range: 0.00057%-35.85%) vs. 0.049% (range: 0.00026%-18.94%) in plasma. ctDNA was detected in baseline plasma in 10\/14 (71%) responding pts (median eVAF: 0.325%) and in 8\/10 (80%) non-responders (median eVAF: 0.107%). Changes in ctDNA levels reflected clinical responses. After treatment with ipi plus nivo, ctDNA was undetectable in 13\/14 (93%) responding pts, and in only 4\/10 (40%) of non-responders (p=0.0088). Of the 17 pts with undetectable ctDNA before surgery, 13 (76%) had a pathological response and 16\/17 (94%) pts remained recurrence-free after a median follow-up of 34 months. Urine ctDNA was detected at baseline in 12\/14 (86%) responding pts (median eVAF: 9.634%) and in 8\/10 (80%) non-responders (median eVAF: 2%). After treatment with ipi plus nivo, urine ctDNA was detected in 8\/14 (57%) responding pts (median eVAF: 0.87%), and in 8\/10 (80%) non-responders (median eVAF: 0.162%). No association was observed between urine ctDNA detection and response (p=0.39). Detection of plasma ctDNA by RaDaR&#8482; after neoadjuvant treatment was associated with pathological response and clinical outcome. In contrast, ctDNA detection in urine was not associated with outcomes. Absence of plasma ctDNA pre-surgery may predict complete response to ipi plus nivo at surgery and may be helpful in guiding clinical decisions in stage III UC, in particular to select pts for bladder-sparing strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c07a021c-a441-4775-b3a5-59c558cd60e1\/@D03B8ZBw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Bladder cancer,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12829"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jeroen Van Dorp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christodoulos Pipinikas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nick Van Dijk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Greg Jones<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Gil-Jimenez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Marsico<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maurits L.

Given its resistance to medications and high mortality at later stages, there is a need to identify biomarkers that can detect ccRCC. KRAB Zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) are the largest family of mammalian transcription regulators. They are differentially expressed in various tissues during cellular development and phenotypic differentiation. Though poorly understood, these transcription factors, are also differentially expressed in several cancers though very few have been reported to be implicated in ccRCC. Using bioinformatics techniques, we have demonstrated that ZNF649 and its paralog ZNF613 are suppressed in clear cell renal carcinomas (p&#60;0.001) relative to normal tissues. Moreover, The ZNF649 and ZNF613 transcripts were downregulated across all histological grades and pathological stages (p&#60;0.001). In addition, both ZNF649 and ZNF613 downregulation was associated with metastasis and unsatisfactory patient survival (p&#60;0.001). Univariate and multivariante Cox regression analysis of age, gene expression, gender, pathological stage, histological grade, and pathological N in relationship to overall survival in ccRCC patients revealed that ZNF649 expression was predictive of overall survival. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of the Gene Ontology Biological Processes database indicate that the top pathways enriched with genes correlated to ZNF649 expression were associated with angiogenesis, cellular motility and mitochondrial regulation (p&#60;0.001 and FDR &#60;0.05). Taken collectively, our observations indicate that ZNF649 is a prognostic marker and is a putative tumor suppressor gene in clear cell renal carcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63aff069-9b36-49b8-898e-16013f396980\/@D03B8ZBw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Zinc finger proteins,Kidney cancer,Biomarkers,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12830"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Renee Reams<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone O.

Importantly, there is currently no clinically validated way to estimate response to NAC before CX, where a pathological assessment of tumor down-staging is used as a proxy for response. Identification and tracking of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been shown to reflect prognosis and treatment response in several cancers, including bladder cancer. Here, we aim to investigate the capability of a combined plasma, urine supernatant and urine pellet mutation analysis by deep targeted sequencing for detecting residual tumor and treatment response before CX.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>In total, 92 patients with localized MIBC treated with NAC followed by CX were included in the study. DNA extracted from primary tumors and leukocytes were subjected to whole exome sequencing for identification of approx. 50 mutations per patient that were used to design a custom NGS panel. Urine supernatants (n=281), urine pellets (n=114) and plasma samples (n=167), collected before CX, were subjected to deep targeted sequencing employing unique molecular identifiers (UMI). Mutations were assessed using the Shearwater algorithm and samples were further assessed using Fisher&#8217;s Method and bootstrapping of random mutations. In-silico analyses identified the limit of detection to be approx. 0.1%. For 56 patients, plasma mutation data (n=288 samples) were obtained from a previously published study by our group.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Tumor derived DNA levels in paired urine supernatants and pellets were correlated (rho=0.8), however with higher levels in pellets when adjusting for the extracted amount of DNA (p&#60;0.001). Tumor derived DNA was less frequently observed in plasma (20% of samples) compared to urine supernatants and pellets (63% and 68% of samples, respectively) and at lower levels (p&#60;0.001, both comparisons). Tumor derived DNA levels were associated with tumor stage for plasma samples, but demonstrated variable levels for urine supernatants and pellets. Interestingly, we observed clearance of tumor derived DNA to be significantly associated with NAC response (pathological downstaging to &#60;T1) for urine supernatants (p&#60;0.001) but not for urine pellets (p=0.23) and plasma (p=0.05). Conversely, clearance of tumor derived DNA in plasma was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival (p&#60;0.001) but not for urine supernatants (p=0.06) and urine pellets (p=0.53).<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>Tumor derived DNA was more frequently observed in urine samples and at higher levels compared to plasma samples. Interestingly, we show that tumor derived DNA dynamics in urine supernatants might better reflect the local tumor environment and plasma-based tumor derived DNA better reflects outcome following surgery, i.e. disease dissemination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ada91a0-f55e-4efc-9737-56066ef8c7a7\/@D03B8ZBw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Bladder cancer,Targeted sequencing,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12831"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emil Christensen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iver Nordentoft<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara K.
