[{"Abstract":"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains the fifth leading cause of cancer related death in women worldwide, partly due to the survival of chemoresistant, stem-like tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that promote disease relapse. Previous studies described the role of the NF-kB pathway in promoting TIC chemoresistance and survival through the action of key transcription factors (TFs) like RelA and RelB. These TFs serve as key master regulators of genes important for the inflammatory response, which also overlap with the regulation of targets associated with cancer promotion. We previously showed that RelA and RelB exert different effects in ovarian cancer cells, with RelB relatively more important for tumor initiation. In this study, we hypothesize that NF-kB signaling regulates the expression of several microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially through RelA and RelB to promote TIC survival and proliferation. miRNAs comprise a subset of small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression and present potential therapeutic targets for clinical use. Inducible shRNA stably was expressed in OV90 EOC cells to knockdown RelA or RelB; cells were subsequently analyzed by miR-seq to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in cells grown in TIC vs adherent (adh) conditions. To validate the miR-seq findings, we performed qPCR assays of the candidate miRNAs differentially expressed in TIC or adh conditions with RelA or RelB knocked down. We confirmed the decreased expression of oncogenic miRNAs hsa-miR-105-5p and hsa-miR-452-5p, while also confirming the increased expression of tumor suppressive miRNA hsa-miR-34a-5p observed in the miR-seq using OV90 cells. Ongoing work will validate these expression changes in additional cell lines and conduct functional assays to characterize the effect of mimicking or inhibiting these miRNAs of interest. The identification of miRNAs differentially expressed in TICs under the control of RelA or RelB will provide key insights in designing treatments against them to prevent disease relapse in patients with EOC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5065a885-45e1-4644-8b7e-35b8bfc28e85\/@z03B8ZSY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-02 miRNA regulation of cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Ovarian cancer,NF-&#954;B,Tumor initiating cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17898"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"833f7c1d-2738-46cd-bc45-6be697d980eb","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/833f7c1d-2738-46cd-bc45-6be697d980eb\/@z03B8ZSY\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rahul D.

The highly abundant and acinar cell-enriched miR-216a is reduced during in vitro acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM), throughout PanIN progression, during the development of pancreatitis in mice and humans, and during development of mouse and human PDAC. To investigate the contribution of miR-216a in the development of PDAC, we generated a <i>miR-216a<\/i> germline knockout mouse (216aKO) via CRISPR genetic editing of a minimal and precise deletion of the miR-216a precursor sequence without affecting the host gene. We crossed this 216aKO mouse to the <i>LSL-Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>; LSL-Trp53<sup>Flox\/+<\/sup>; Pdx1<sup>Cre\/+<\/sup><\/i> (KPC) mice to produce a transgenic mouse with an activating Kras mutation, p53 deletion, and knockout of miR-216a (referred to here as miR216aKPC). miR216aKPC displayed an increase in tumor progression compared to KPC and had reduced survival - median 15 weeks miR216aKPC vs. 25 weeks for KPC. miR216aKPC produced lung metastasis by 12 weeks of age which were not present in the lungs of similarly aged KPC mice. Transfection of miR-216a mimetic oligo into cell lines derived from KPC or 216aKPC mice did not reduce viability or alter cellular morphology, suggesting that a potential tumor suppressive role of miR-216a functions during the early stages of PDAC development. A three dimensional ADM assay using acinar cells derived from both mouse and human pancreata will be applied to investigate the contributions of miR-216a on the development of ADM and cell polarity. To discover miR-216a target genes that are responsible for the increased tumorigenesis, cell lines derived from miR216aKPC will be transfected with miR-216a mimetic or scrambled control oligo followed by RNA sequencing. Our results thus far suggest a tumor suppressive role for miR-216a in the early development of PDAC and future studies will investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms driving acinar cell-induced PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eb285e9d-3860-4f16-8eb9-d28b9ef325d1\/@z03B8ZSY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-02 miRNA regulation of cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,MicroRNA,Knockout mice,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17899"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew A.

Obesity is a major risk factor for prostate cancer. Leptin is an obesity hormone that controls body weight by regulating energy intake and expenditure, and clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between blood leptin levels and PCa development. MicroRNAs (miRs) are master regulators of cancer cell signaling, including in advanced PCa. We previously identified miR-628-5p as a potential biomarker in PCa patients that was downregulated in serum samples of men with PCa (Tumor Biol., 2014, 35: 4867). In this study, we investigated the link between the obesity hormone leptin and the functional role of miR-628-5p in PCa cell lines. We demonstrate that leptin downregulates the expression of miR-628-5p and increases cell proliferation and migration in PCa cells. Enforced expression of miR-628-5p inhibited cell proliferation in PCa cells. Further, miR-628-5p reduced PCa cell survival\/migration\/invasion\/spheroids formation and cell stemness. Mechanistically, miR-628-5p binds with JAG1-3&#8217;UTR and inhibits the expression of Jagged-1 (JAG1). JAG1 inhibition by miR-628-5p also downregulated Notch signaling, decreased the expression of snail\/slug, and modulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasiveness in PC3 cells. Furthermore, miR-628-5p increased sensitivity towards enzalutamide and docetaxel by inducing cell apoptosis. Collectively our data suggested that miR-628-5p is a key regulator of PCa carcinogenesis modulated by adipokine leptin and offers a novel therapeutic opportunity to inhibit the growth of advanced PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2b0d9bb6-5fa8-4891-b0fc-ba2c88b38b6e\/@z03B8ZSY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-02 miRNA regulation of cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,MicroRNA 628,Leptin,Jagged1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17900"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Leslimar Rios Colon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliet Chijioke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suryakant Niture<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zainab Afzal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Qi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anvesha Srivastava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malathi Ramalinga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Habib Kedir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrice Cagle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Arthur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gagan Deep<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simeng Suy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean Collins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepak Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>.

One reason behind the lack of efficacy in cancer drug therapeutics is due to the development of tumor heterogeneity. We hypothesize that different miRNAs target different SC genes, which leads to the emergence of multiple cancer SC (CSC) subpopulations and tumor heterogeneity. Flow cytometry helped evaluate the expression of multiple SC markers including ALDH1, CD166, LGR5, and LRIG1 in the HT29 CRC cell line. CSC sub-populations were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and the expression of miRNAs in each CSC subpopulation was measured using NanoString profiling. The differential expression of miRNAs between CSC subpopulations helped rank the different levels of miRNA upregulation in each of the CSC subpopulations. The mRNAs predicted to be targeted by the most significantly upregulated miRNAs were identified using bioinformatics analysis via NanoString and mRNAs were classified according to their predicted function by David functional annotation analysis. Altogether, our results indicate that multiple CSC subpopulations exist in the HT29 cell-line, and we identified unique miRNA signatures for each CSC subpopulation. Moreover, the mRNAs predicted to be targeted by the miRNAs in each CSC subpopulation were found to have different functional classifications. We conclude that multiple CSC subpopulations emerge in HT29 cells due to the expression of unique miRNAs that target different SC genes (and their co-expressed genes), resulting in the emergence of multiple CSC subpopulations and tumor heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/37a3d568-bd46-4305-beea-75cb5fca05a9\/@z03B8ZSY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-02 miRNA regulation of cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Colorectal cancer,Tumor heterogeneity,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17901"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Victoria A.

To meet energetic and material needs for high-rate proliferation and tumorigenesis, cancer cells generally rely more heavily on vital nutrients (e.g., glucose, amino acids, and vitamins) than normal cells. Therefore, controlling nutrient transport and metabolism in cancer cells is a promising therapeutic strategy. Our previous studies have suggested that microRNA-1291-5p (miR-1291-5p or miR-1291) is downregulated in pancreatic cancer (PC) cells and acts as a tumor suppressor. The current study is to delineate the role of miR-1291 in the control of PC cell metabolism and develop miR-1291 therapy. We first employed our newly-invented RNA bioengineering technology to achieve high-level and large-scale, <i>in vivo<\/i> fermentation production of a fully-humanized biologic miR-1291 agent at a high degree of homogeneity (&#62; 4 mg BioRNA per liter of culture and &#62; 97% purity). RNA sequencing studies revealed that BioRNA\/miR-1291 was selectively processed to target miR-1291-5p to modulate the transcriptome in PC cells. Proteomics study showed that a number of proteins were reduced remarkably in AsPC-1 cells by biologic miR-1291-5p, among which PNPO, an enzyme that mediates the synthesis of essential nutrient vitamin B6 (VB6), was revealed as a leading target of miR-1291-5p. Besides PNPO and the previously-reported glucose transporter SLC2A1\/GLUT1, amino acid transporter SLC7A5\/LAT1 was verified as a direct target for miR-1291-5p. Downregulation of PNPO, LAT1, GLUT1 protein expression by biological miR-1291 led to sharp alteration of homeostasis of glucose, amino acids, and VB6 in human PC cells, and subsequent suppression of glycolysis capacity and mitochondrial function as well as the increase of oxidative stress. Combination treatment with bioengineered miR-1291 and 5-FU exerted strong synergism in the inhibition of PC cell and organoid proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i>. In addition, miR-1291 mono- and combination therapy were effective to control tumor growth in pancreatic cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. These results demonstrate a critical role for miR-1291 in the regulation of PC cell metabolism which provides insight in developing new therapeutic strategies for PC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Pancreatic cancer,Metabolism,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17902"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mei-Juan Tu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank J.

In this study, we identified dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in TNBC by profiling miRNA and mRNA expression. In patients with TNBC, miR-371b-5p expression was reduced, and miR-371b-5p overexpression significantly mitigated TNBC cell growth, migration, and invasion. In addition, we found that expression of cold shock domain-containing protein E1 (CSDE1), a direct target gene of miR-371b-5p, was upregulated in TNBC cells, and inhibition of CSDE1 expression alleviated TNBC cell growth by regulating <i>RAC1<\/i> transcription. Mechanistically, CSDE1, phosphorylated C-terminal domain (p-CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and CDK7 form a complex, and downregulation of CSDE1 leads to weak interaction between RNAPII p-CTD and CDK7, resulting in a decrease in RNAPII p-CTD expression to reduce <i>RAC1<\/i> transcript levels in CSDE1-deficient TNBC cells. Our data demonstrate that miR-371b-5p is a tumor-suppressive miRNA that regulates the CSDE1\/Rac1 axis and could be a potential prognostic biomarker for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82f58234-e393-4ef7-be19-cb6e3aeb00e5\/@z03B8ZSY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,MicroRNA,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17903"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jong Hoon Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yesol Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Je Yeong Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soo-Been Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minah Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this study, it was found that luminal and triple-negative breast cancer require distinct therapeutic approaches because of their different expressions of autophagy flux. We identified that autophagy flux was inhibited in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) CSCs. Moreover, miRNA-181a (miR-181a) is upregulated both in TNBC CSCs and patients. ATG5 and ATG2B participate in the early formation of autophagosomes and were revealed as targets of miR-181a. Inhibition of miR-181a expression led to attenuation of TNBC cancer stemness and an increase in autophagy flux. Furthermore, treatment with curcumin led to attenuation of cancer stemness in TNBC CSCs; the expression of ATG5 and ATG2B was enhanced and there was an increase of autophagy flux. These results indicated that ATG5 and ATG2B are involved in the suppression of cancer stemness in TNBC. In summary, autophagy inhibits cancer stemness through the miR-181a-regulated mechanism in TNBC. Promoting tumor-suppressive autophagy using curcumin may be a potential method for the treatment of TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6b286822-ba8f-4f61-839f-007239668094\/@z03B8ZSY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Autophagy,MicroRNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17904"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jong Hoon Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jee Won Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yesol Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaehee Jun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yejin Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>.

We found that triple-negative and HER2+ breast cancer patients have elevated expression of miR150 in the TCGA and METABRIC patient cohort. Both cohorts showed significantly increased expression of miR150 in grade IV patients. Further studies explained that miR150 is strongly correlated with CD8+ T cells and B cells in accord with increased expression of immune-checkpoint markers PD-1, PDL-1, and CTLA4. We, therefore, hypothesized that higher expression of miR150 in tumors attracted more immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. We use two triple negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-231 and BT-549 cells and overexpressed miR150 followed by co-culture them with Jurkart and B cells. Our data revealed that both jurkart and B cells had increased migration towards cancer cells overexpressed miR150 mimic compared to miR150 mimic negative control. Interestingly, overexpressed miR150 mimic in cancer cells inhibited migration in both triple-negative breast cancer cells. Overexpression of miR150 mimic in cancer cells did not alter cell proliferation. To understand further the role of miR150 in breast cancer, we overexpressed miR150 mimic and its corresponding negative control in MDA-231 and did RNA seq analysis. RNA seq data explained that approximately 4927 genes are upregulated with miR150 mimic overexpression. Interestingly several chemokines and mediators of metastasis (CXCL2, CXCL1 CCL20, IGBP3, and ANGPTL4) are upregulated among the top 50 upregulated genes. In addition, gene enrichment analysis explained that TNF-&#945; signaling pathways, Hypoxia, epithelial-mesenchymal pathways, E2F signaling, and Inflammatory pathways are a few upregulated pathways with miR150 mimic overexpression compared to the negative control. We also found miR150 high tumor enriched correlated with interferon-alpha and gamma signaling, inflammatory response pathways similar with cohort analysis data. In conclusion, miR150 in cancer plays a key role in interferon and inflammatory signaling pathways attracting more immune cells and suppressing the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/553f35e9-0a84-4fb9-be26-72cc0093d4d3\/@z03B8ZSY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,MicroRNA,Immunosuppression,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17905"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aparna Maiti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masanori Oshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rongrong Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nitai Hait<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuaki Takabe<\/i><\/presenter>.

Importantly, current treatment options for metastatic breast cancer fail to elicit an anti-tumor response, leading to a 5-year survival rate below 30%. While most classes of therapy focus on inhibiting or targeting specific proteins, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) offer a unique, relatively untapped, source of potential therapeutic targets. Ongoing experiments are evaluating the regulatory role of the lncRNA YTHDF3-AS1 (ENSG00000270673), which has the potential to develop into a novel therapeutic intervention of BrCa. Through genome-wide analysis, we found that YTHDF3-AS1 expression correlates with essential developmental regulatory genes such as CA3, VPS28, EXOSC4, and TM2D2 and according to pathway analysis is likely linked with the Wnt pathway. Additionally, TCGA data reveals that over 5% of patients with BrCa have an increased copy number of YTHDF3-AS1. Although the role of YTHDF3-AS1 has yet to be explored, YTHDF3 expression was recently shown to be a critical driver of breast cancer metastasis. Of note, YTHDF3-AS1 is upstream of the protein-coding region, but within the promoter region of the YTHDF3 gene. Mechanistically, this allows the lncRNA YTHDF3-AS1 to potentially upregulate the expression of the protein-coding YTHDF3 gene, as two known functions of antisense lncRNAs describe the ability to 1) induce nearby gene expression through binding to the promoter region and 2) stabilize the RNA product of the nearby gene through binding to the 5&#8217;UTR. Interestingly, this manner of relationship between antisense (or \"divergent\") lncRNAs and their protein-coding partner was shown to be highly prevalent in pluripotent stem cells, with the downregulation of both the antisense and protein-coding transcripts following differentiation. Together, our preliminary analysis and previous literature suggest that the lncRNA YTHDF3-AS1 may contribute to the upregulation of YTHDF3, which is a known metastatic promoting protein. Our current study aims to determine the functional role of YTHDF3-AS1 in BrCa oncogenesis, with an emphasis on the mechanistic actions of this lncRNA for the development of future therapeutic approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/75ee98f2-cc42-4d5e-ada9-69c47587ab96\/@A03B8ZSZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Long noncoding RNA,Breast cancer,Metastasis,lncRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17906"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alakesh Bera<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Surya Radhakrishnan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Russ<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diya Biswas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madhan Subramanian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harvey B.

One mechanism of communication that has become increasingly appreciated is the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), heterogeneous multi-signal messengers that support cancer dissemination through the transfer of biomolecules such as oncoproteins and noncoding RNA species. However, little is understood about EVs in relation to chemotherapy resistance. In this study, we profiled two different breast cancer cell lines: 1) BT549 (triple negative), treated with gemcitabine and paclitaxel chemotherapy, and 2) MCF7 (estrogen receptor-positive), treated with palbociclib and fulvestrant, compared to their wild-type states. EVs were collected from these cells using tangential flow filtration and quantified with Brownian motion-based nanoparticle tracking analysis and microfluidic resistive pulse sensing, and profiling of RNA and peptide markers was completed through RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. Initial data showed that representative mitochondrial ribosomal genes <i>mt12S<\/i> and <i>MRPS14<\/i> were among the most upregulated RNAs in our drug-exposed EV samples, indicating that extracellular transfer of mitochondrial materials plays a role in cancer growth under chemotherapy stress. These findings were supported by prior genetic research at the Vasudevan laboratory, in which a set of mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs was found to be upregulated in cytosine arabinoside-induced chemoresistant acute monocytic leukemia cells, as well as by the recent discovery of mitovesicles, a novel population of EVs that originate from mitochondria. Through additional efforts to isolate further subtypes of EVs, the mechanisms by which these mitochondrial cargoes promote chemoresistant phenotypes will be uncovered.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/77e34a3b-8fe7-4659-bfd9-73f29b3a08d2\/@A03B8ZSZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Mitochondria,Expression profiling,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18379"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Harrison Ngue<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyejin Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shobha Vasudevan<\/i><\/presenter>.

These carcinogens include, Cadmium, Mercury, Chromium, Aluminum, Nickel and Arsenic. However, there was no such analysis for elucidating the mechanism of carcinogenic effects and epigenetic reprogramming of human bone marrow stem cells. In this study, we analyzed the carcinogenic effects of mentioned carcinogens, and the mechanism of epigenetic reprogramming using NIH Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET), Comparative Toxico-genomics Database (CTD), AACR Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) database, database of Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP), National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and other bioinformatics database. We found from CTD analysis that the chemical gene interactions showed highly expressed of 272 common genes with miR140 by Cadmium, Mercury from total 3704 genes (approximately 7% affected genes). The AACR GENIE database analysis showed CDKN3, is associated with bone cancer (2 clinical data), HDAC7, TP53, MAPK3K1, MAP2K2 (8 clinical data) found among 272 genes regulated by Cadmium and Mercury. The CTD analysis showed the chemical gene interactions of highly expressed of 102 common genes with miR140 by Chromium, Mercury from a total of 1406 genes; 268 common genes with CD84, CD226 by Mercury, Nickel from a total of 5032 genes; 103 common genes with CD226 by Aluminum, Mercury from a total of 2556 genes; 248 common genes by Arsenic, Mercury from total 5508 genes. Among these 5508 genes, 248 common genes with ALDHA1, 247 common genes with CD40, 248 common genes with CD44, 247 common genes with CD423, 247 common genes with miR10A by Arsenic, Mercury from total 2556 genes. The epigenetic mechanisms of histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 of B cells, hemopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal bone marrow, and chondrocyte stem cells and miRNAs) and these carcinogens have been revealed by the database of EHP, NIEHS, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) database. Our previous study reported that the regulation of epigenetic bivalent histone modifications at transcript starts sequences (TSS) of target genes for heterogenic adult stem cells (CSCs)reprogramming and our current bioinformatics analysis revealed that TP53 is epigenetically reprogrammed with close interaction of thirteen genes by these carcinogens. Therefore, it is important to find the actual epigenetic mechanism both genomic and epigenomic transcriptional regulation and carcinogenic effects of these carcinogens on bone marrow stem cells, and our current study revealed this important relationship.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2ca87cc0-d78f-4108-9355-fb513cbf32f6\/@A03B8ZSZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-01 Epigenetic control of miRNA expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Bioinformatics,Epigenomics,Bone marrow,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18813"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Benedrica Solomon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richgena Sturrup<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jada Dixon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kiyona Jackson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Biancaliz Cruz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlissia Ferguson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor Walker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ralph Elisson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Harris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesennia Bonilla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rose Mary Stiffin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marilyn Sherman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandra Manzon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swarnava Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madhumita Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jayanta Kumar Das<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Clinical and pathological information such as tumor grade (High Grade (HG), Low Grade (LG)), depth of invasion (Ta, T1, CIS), and response to BCG treatment was also obtained. Exosome Isolation and total RNA extraction including microRNAs from cell-free urine after centrifugation were obtained. Library preparation for miRNA expression was done (QIAseq&#174; miRNA Library) for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis in a NextSeq 2000 single read platform, 75 bp with 15-20 million reads per sample. Reads were then queried against miRDeep2 software for identification. Only miRNAs having at least 20 counts considering all samples were included. After normalization, significantly and deferentially expressed microRNAs (&#62;2-Fold) were selected for analysis. Bioinformatic analysis including sequence alignment was performed under the STAR-based approach. Identified microRNAs were then used to classify\/predict the response to treatment and its relationship with other clinicopathologic variables.<br \/><b><i>Results: <\/i><\/b>A total of 56 urine samples from 13 patients were available\/used for analysis including 10 High Grade Ta and 3 High Grade T1 patients.

When compared to BCG unresponsive patients, BCG responders showed 45 differentially expressed miRNAs. Statistically significant differentially expressed miRNAs (Fold-change &#62;2, p value &#60;0.05) were 12 miRNAs, upregulated were miR132-3p (p=0.042); miR-187-3p (p=0.021); miR-409-3p (p=0.043) and miR1301-3p (p=0.048). Downregulated miRNAs were miR-let7-5p (p=0.007), miR-3605-3p (p=0.047), miR-140-5p (p=0.031), miR-500a-5p (p=0.051), miR-629-5p (p=0.039), miR-454-3p (p=0.05), miR-2110 (p=0.049) and miR-30c-5p (p=0.03).

This disease is characterized by high rates of chemo resistance and late initial detection. We have previously reported that inhibition of nuclear exporter protein Exportin 1 (XPO1\/CRM1) with the small molecule inhibitor selinexor (KPT-330) is a viable therapeutic approach in gastric cancer. Inhibition of XPO1 blocks proliferation and suppresses tumor growth through nuclear retention of tumor suppressor proteins such as TP53. Besides nuclear retention, we also demonstrated that XPO1 inhibition leads to a perturbation of cancer specific microRNAs including microRNA-7974 downregulation (miR-7974) and microRNA-129-1-3p upregulation (miR-129-1-3p) within a small RNA sequencing study. In this study we evaluated the role of these microRNAs in gastric cancer perpetuation in respect to their naive functions in five distinct subtypes of gastric cancer. Our results show over-expression of miR-7974 and loss of miR-129-1-3p promotes gastric cancer growth and progression, based on specific subtype of disease. We have further found that the differential expression of these microRNAs leads to gastric cancer cellular changes including cell cycle alterations, upregulation of autophagy processes, chemoresistance and alterations in the cellular framework leading to more invasive phenotypes. Validation with normal gastric epithelial cells revealed these microRNAs are relevant as they are perturbed in gastric cancer as well as the proteins in which they modulate. Finally, we have validated treatment of gastric cancer cells with the XPO1 inhibitor selinexor altered the expression of miR-7974 and miR-129-1-3p differently, based on subtype, as we have previously observed in small RNA sequencing screen, leading to a reversal of the pro-cancerous phenotypes previously observed. In <i>vivo<\/i> investigation is currently ongoing to identify whether we can capture either miR-7974 or miR-129-1-3p within the serum as further evidence of microRNA perturbation as a predictive biomarker for selinexor efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/271d3b68-f496-4ea4-ae03-5eff5acab98c\/@A03B8ZSZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Transport,Gastric cancer,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18815"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachel E.

Dense fibrotic stroma is a major obstacle for drug delivery to the tumor cells in PDAC. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are the major stromal cells responsible for fibrotic microenvironment. MicroRNA-217 (miR-217) is known mainly as a tumor suppressor. However, the detailed roles of miR-217 on pathophysiology of PDAC remain unclarified.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Expressions levels of miR-217 were measured in surgically resected human PDAC samples. Using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, miR-217 or negative control miR (NC) were transfected in human pancreatic cancer cells, Panc-1, MIApaca-2, BxPC-3 and murine PAN02 cells, and chemosensitivities to gemcitabine and paclitaxel were investigated by MTS assay. Human hPSC-1 (obtained from Riken cell bank, Japan) was cultured in 20%FBS+DMEM and the changes of phenotypes and expression levels of miR-217 after the stimulation with TGF-&#946;1 was measured by fluorescein microscope and digital PCR, respectively.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The expression level of miR-217 was markedly downregulated in PDAC tissues than in noncancerous pancreatic tissues (P&#60;0.001, n=9). Overexpression of miR-217 significantly inhibited the proliferation of Panc-1, MIApaca-2 and BxPC-3 (P&#60;0.001) and migration of Panc-1, MIApaca-2 and PAN02 (P&#60;0.05). Lipofection of miR-217 further reduced the number of PAN02 exposed to 1-5nM gemcitabine (P&#60;0.0001) and 0.01-0.1uM paclitaxel (P=0.0085) which resulted in the reduced the IC-50 as compared with NC. Human PSC-1 stimulated with TGF-&#946;1 (10ng\/ml) significantly reduced miR-217 expression compared to nascent cells. The stimulation with TGF-&#946;1 upregulated the expression of cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) markers, &#945;-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and vimentin. However, the expression levels of these markers were significantly reduced by the kipofection of miR-217.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: MiR-217 affects both cancer and stromal cells in PDAC which may regulate chemosensitivity in PDAC.

We have recently analyzed RNA sequencing data from 493 human neuroblastoma tissues, and identified the long noncoding RNA lincNeur as one of the transcripts, high expression of which most considerably correlated with poor prognosis in both MYCN oncogene-amplified and MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma patients.<br \/><b>Aims:<\/b> To determine the tumorigenic role of lincNeur in neuroblastoma, and to identify the mechanism of action through which lincNeur exerts oncogenic function, also to screen for small molecule compound inhibitors of lincNeur.<br \/><b>Methods and results:<\/b> We performed RNA-binding protein pull-down assay and RNA-immunoprecipitation assay. RALY was identified and validated as one of the binding proteins of lincNeur. We also identified down-stream targets of lincNeur via genome-wide differential gene expression analysis. E2F1 and AURKA were identified as among the transcripts significantly down-regulated after lincNeur knockdown. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that lincNeur knockdown reduced E2F1 and AURKA mRNA and protein expression, and reduced N-Myc and c-Myc protein but not mRNA expression. In addition, lincNeur or RALY knockdown reduced, while over-expression of lincNeur or RALY promoted, neuroblastoma cell proliferation. We also demonstrated lincNeur knockdown significantly suppressed RALY protein binding to E2F1 and AURKA mRNAs. Mouse xenograft model experiment showed that lincNeur knockdown suppressed neuroblastoma tumor progression <i>in vivo<\/i>. Importantly, we have confirmed the binding site between lincNeur and RALY, and are screening small molecule compound libraries for inhibitors of lincNeur and RALY interaction for neuroblastoma therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The novel long noncoding RNA lincNeur promotes neuroblastoma by interacting with RALY to up-regulate E2F1 and AURKA mRNA and protein, as well as N-Myc and c-Myc protein expression. Small molecule compound inhibitors of lincNeur and RALY interaction is a promising therapeutic approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Long noncoding RNA,Aurora kinase,Neuroblastoma,Myc,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21147"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jing Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pei Yan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Belamy Cheung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Glenn Marshall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcel Dinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

We aimed to investigate the impacts of PCAT1 on tumorigenesis and radioimmune responses and the underlying molecular mechanisms in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify immunosuppressive lncRNAs involved with tumor invasion in NSCLC. The expression levels of PCAT1 were analyzed by in situ hybridization in 55 paired NSCLC and adjacent normal tissues. Both loss- and gain-of-function assays were performed to evaluate the functions of PCAT1 and SOX2 in NSCLC cell behaviors <i>in vivo<\/i> and<i> in vitro<\/i>. Bioinformatic analyses, chromatin isolation by RNA purification and dual-luciferase reporter assays were applied to validate the regulatory effects of PCAT1 on SOX2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase, and rescue assays were utilized to identify the relationship between SOX2 and the cGAS\/STING signaling.<br \/>Results: PCAT1 was immunosuppressive and related with NSCLC invasion. Increased PCAT1 was negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration in NSCLC. PCAT1 knockdown restrained proliferation, increased apoptosis, and inhibited cell migration and invasion <i>in vivo <\/i>and<i> in vitro<\/i>. PCAT1 activated SOX2 that accelerated tumorigenesis and immunosuppression. SOX2 promoted tumor growth through inhibiting cytotoxic T cell immunity. Moreover, SOX2 restrained cGAS transcription and hampered downstream type I IFN-induced immune responses. Inhibition of PCAT1\/SOX2 in collaboration with radiation further inhibited tumor growth, and activated the cGAS\/STING signaling pathway, which enhanced the immune responses of radiotherapy in NSCLC.<br \/>Conclusions: PCAT1\/SOX2 axis promoted tumorigenesis and immunosuppression through inhibition of cGAS\/STING signaling-mediated T-cell activation. Inhibition of PCAT1 and SOX2 synergized with radiotherapy to activate the immune response and could serve as potential therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Radioimmunotherapy,PCAT1\/SOX2,cGAS\/STING Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20427"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanping Gao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nannan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Conghua Xie<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although studies have shown that aberrant expression of lncRNAs mediates disease progression in ovarian cancer (OC), the role of lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 has not been well studied.<br \/><b>Objective: <\/b>To determine the role of ADAMTS9-AS2 on OC pathogenesis.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We examined ADAMTS9-AS2 expression in human OC cells and tumor tissues using in situ hybridization (ISH). ADAMTS9-AS2 was overexpressed in A2780cp20 and IGROV1cp20 cells and evaluated its effects on cell proliferation, viability and apoptosis. To evaluate the role of ADAMTS9-AS2 in tumor suppression, nude mice were injected with ADAMTS9-AS2 over expressing cells. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) was performed to identify the downstream regulators. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the interaction of targeted protein with ADAMTS9-AS2. In addition, epigenetic regulation of ADAMTS9-AS2 was studied using 5-Azacytidine.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A2780cp20 and IGROV1cp20 cells expressed lower amounts of ADAMTS9-AS2, while SKOV3 and PEO4 cells showed higher expression levels. ISH analysis showed dense nuclear staining of ADAMTS9-AS2 in normal fallopian tube sections, whereas OC sections showed reduced expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high expression of ADAMTS9-AS2 had significantly better overall survival (p=0.0079) and progression-free survival (p=0.00018) than those with low ADAMTS9-AS2 expression.<b> <\/b>Overexpression of ADAMTS9-AS2 in A2780cp20 cells resulted in decreased proliferation (p&#60;0.01) and increased apoptosis (p&#60;0.001). ADAMTS9-AS2 overexpressing A2780cp20 and IGROV1cp20 tumor bearing mice showed significant reduction in tumor growth (p=0.002; A2780cp20, p=0.01; IGROV1cp20) when compared to control A2780cp20 and IGROV1 tumor bearing mice. RPPA analysis showed that ANNEXIN A1 was the most upregulated protein upon ADAMTS9-AS2 overexpression. We confirmed that ANNEXIN A1 expression is regulated by ADAMTS9-AS2 by silencing ADAMTS9-AS2. Further, luciferase reporter assay results confirmed the interaction between ADAMTS9-AS2 and ANNEXIN A1 promoter and silencing ADAMTS9-AS2 with siRNA abolished this effect. Consistently with our previous <i>in vitro<\/i> findings, we observed a significant increase of ANNEXIN A1 expression in the ADAMTS9-AS2 overexpressing mice, compared with the A2780cp20 control. Further, azacytidine treated A2780cp20 cells showed an increase in ADAMTS9-AS2 expression.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: ADAMTS9-AS2 acts as a tumor suppressor, by enhancing the expression of ANNEXIN A1, and thereby regulating tumor growth. Thus, ADAMTS9-AS2-ANNEXIN A1 axis may represent a novel therapeutic target in OC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Long noncoding RNA,Noncoding RNA,Ovarian cancer,Gene regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21762"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emine Bayraktar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guy Katz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dahai Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristian Rodriguez-Aguayo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lingegowda S.
