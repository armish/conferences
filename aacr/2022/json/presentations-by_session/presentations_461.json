Many of these cues are derived from the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME modulates cellular proliferation, survival, and resistance to therapy in breast cancer. The TME is a bio-mechanical and biochemical reservoir for extracellular matrix and signaling factors (cytokines, growth factors, lipids, and hormones). In addition, the TME houses a diverse array of cell populations including adipocytes, vasculature, stem cells, immune cells, and cancer cells. Currently models do not reprpoduce the TME in vitro. The goal of this study was to develop a complex and dynamic micro-physiological 3D tumor model for pre-clinical studies using the native human breast environment. We developed a technique to maintain healthy human breast tissue (HBT) alive ex vivo for up to 8 weeks in the presence of breast cancer (BC) cells creating a breast cancer micro-physiological system (BC-MPS). In this study, we demonstrate alterations to lipid accumulation, matrix fiber remodeling, and cytokine profile in our BC-MPS system. We used RNA sequencing to detect breast cancer cell line signatures retained in the BC-MPS system. Results demonstrate retention of the breast cancer cell line transcriptome for a minimum of 14 days in vitro. In addition we identify alterations to genes associated with the TME, specifically the extracellular matrix and metabolism. Our novel model will allow for 1) real-time examination of BC-HBT interactions and 2) the isolation of BC-specific factors vs. patient-specific factors on the development and progression of BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4e6a28b2-d2de-4386-8882-5b89ef5269ab\/@z03B8ZMx\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,3D models,Metabolism,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14438"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Frank H.

To support this effort, early drug development emphasizes establishing multiple strategies that address treatment response, resistance, and combination effects, all with rapid turnover. Given the ever-increasing relevance of 3D <i>in vitro<\/i> models, Labcorp employs 3D model systems co-developed with zPREDICTA. These organ-specific models can support tumor cell growth and mimic the composition and architecture of both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. While 2D <i>in vitro<\/i> assays are preferred for screening efforts of chemical libraries, mainly because of cost, they do not recapitulate the tumor architecture and the microenvironment that is more comparable to<i> in vivo <\/i>models. This can result in differences in pharmacological potencies of standard of care (SoC) agents when compared to the 3D and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. zPREDICTA 3D assays serve as a tool for <i>in vitro<\/i> screening of tumor cell lines, which in long term cultures develop similar characteristics to <i>in vivo<\/i> disease states. Specifically, this <i>in vitro<\/i> system correlates well with breast and lung carcinoma <i>in vivo<\/i> models when matching rank order of potencies of known SoC agents. zPREDICTA tumor-specific 3D systems as well as 2D cultures and <i>in vivo <\/i>models were used<i> <\/i>to compare and contrast the activity of a set of anticancer agents. Human MDA-MB-231 cells were sensitive to paclitaxel both in 2D and in the 3D r-Breast (IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 7.9nM and 6.1nM, respectively) as well as <i>in vivo<\/i>, with complete growth inhibition at the dose of 15mg\/kg. Paclitaxel was cytotoxic in 2D cultures of murine 4T1 breast tumor cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=59nM), but not in the 3D reconstructed mouse breast model (r-mBreast) or <i>in vivo,<\/i> where the syngeneic 4T1 model was refractory to paclitaxel up to 10mg\/kg. Similarly, NCI-H460 cells were sensitive to paclitaxel in 2D (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=2.3nM), while minimal response was seen in the 3D r-Lung model, and in vivo there was minimal response seen at a 20mg\/kg treatment. These same cells were refractory to erlotinib in 2D, 3D, and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Additional SoC agents were profiled in these models and will also be discussed. Taken together these data demonstrate that zPREDICTA&#8217;s organ-specific 3D models mimic <i>in vivo<\/i> response with a higher fidelity than the standard 2D cultures. Additional <i>in vitro<\/i> reconstructed 3D histotype models are being developed and validated with the goal of providing faster and more predictive <i>in vivo <\/i>results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9546c4e0-a73e-4f64-a307-a94704d84fe7\/@z03B8ZMx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Screening,3D,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14439"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sumithra Urs<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Steffey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Ryou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Kirshner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Wise<\/i><\/presenter>.

Additionally, these models lack racial\/ethnic (R\/E) diversity, failing to address the cancer health disparity (CHD) observed in Black men with PCa who experience double the incidence and mortality rates as compared to White men. Population-based <i>in vitro<\/i> PCa models that support crosstalk between different cell types will improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to this CHD and improve the prediction of drug response in specific populations. Here, we used the high-throughput, perfusion-based microfluidic platform called the MIMETAS OrganoPlate&#174; to culture up to 96 individual, multicellular PCa-on-a-chip cultures in parallel. PCa PDX cells of various R\/E were embedded together with E2Crimson-labeled stromal fibroblasts in a migration-permissive hyaluronic acid hydrogel in the gel compartment, alongside an endothelium-lined perfusion channel containing a targeted immune cell population. Using high content imaging, we confirmed the stability and viability of the cultures over 7 days. The cultures maintained a 3D structure with PCa cells and fibroblasts evenly dispersed throughout the height of the gel compartment and a blood vessel-like structure within the perfusion channel. Closer evaluation of the gel compartment revealed a close association between PCa cells and stromal fibroblasts in a core-shell structure with PCa clusters surrounded by fibroblasts. Further, all cells maintained expected expression of phenotypic markers (PCa: epCAM, PSMA; fibroblast: vimentin, endothelium: CD31). For the immune component, medium and cell tracker dye conditions were optimized to support immune cell viability. Over 72 hours, immune cells were monitored, revealing migration of PBMCs through the gel compartment. Finally, the value of the complex, population-based multicellular <i>in vitro <\/i>model of PCa will be evaluated in a drug screen comparing the system with simple, PCa PDX monocultures. This R\/E diverse 3D prostate tumor model will enable the full incorporation of all cell types and ECM into a single model which will better recapitulate population specific PCa and drug response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/39a33b0f-381b-460e-b77a-3ebeb012d864\/@z03B8ZMx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Health Disparity,Organ-on-a-Chip,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14441"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Divya Iyer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrei Bonteanu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Shepherd<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rick Kittles<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nora Navone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Harrington<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Bircsak<\/i><\/presenter>.

Targeting the TNBC microenvironment via the biophysical properties of the tumor vasculature is a promising approach. The objective of this study was to engineer a microphysiological model of vascularized TNBC with validated pathological properties of tumor vasculature for in vitro modeling of selective drug delivery via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. We engineered a method for standardized production of milliscale tissues housed in fluidic culture devices that are accessible only via a fully anastomosed and perfusable internal vasculature comprised of endothelial cells and organ specific fibroblasts. We first established a baseline of vascular morphometry, endothelial barrier function, inflammatory activation, and perivascular extracellular matrix (ECM) composition in vascularized tissues devoid of cancer cells. In parallel, we developed a novel approach for processing patient-derived TNBC tissues into injectable explants of disaggregated tumor imbibed in ECM hydrogel in less than one hour. These explant tissues cultured in our devices consistently maintain high viability and a Ki67 index around 70%, on par with the Ki67 indexes of source TNBC tumors. We hypothesized that TNBC derivatives would induce the formation of a pathological vasculature in our model. The TNBC derivatives were mixed with exogenous fibroblasts and endothelial cells at optimized ratios and the same workflow described above was used to form vascularized TNBC explant tissues. TNBC-associated vasculature exhibited a significantly altered vascular morphometry relative to cancer-free control tissues across multiple quantitative metrics including vessel length, vessel diameter, and network branch points. These morphological changes were consistent with known dysmorphic features of tumor vasculature. Twofold or greater increases in endothelial ICAM-1 expression in TNBC-associated vasculature was measured by multiple methods of analysis. Increased inflammatory adhesion molecule expression was accompanied by disorganized VE-cadherin junctions and disrupted patterns of perivascular cell coverage that suggested TNBC-associated vasculature should be significantly more permeable. FITC-dextran perfusion studies revealed widespread macromolecular leakage from TNBC-associated vasculature into the TNBC explant tissue interstitium by 5 minutes, whereas no leakage was observed from control vasculature for the duration of perfusion up to one hour. Ongoing work to be presented is focused on validating our model as a platform for studying drug delivery via the enhanced permeability and retention effect using Abraxane nanoparticles.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/740342fc-57c5-4ccb-bfe4-f43f4e29a27f\/@z03B8ZMx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vascular permeability,Vascular targeting,Microenvironment,Stroma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14443"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kevin M.

Two thirds of breast cancers express the luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER&#945;+) phenotype that is initially responsive to antihormonal therapies, but often drug resistance emerges. Three-dimensional <i>ex vivo<\/i> cultures from patient-derived tumor tissue offer new opportunities for drug development and personalized treatment of cancer. However, one of the main challenges in establishing a tumor type faithful<i> ex vivo<\/i> tissue culture system is in optimization of biochemical and physical microenvironment to preserve desired phenotypic features. The ER&#945;+ phenotype is not stable in cultured cells for reasons not fully understood. Together with Helsinki University Hospital we examined 400 patient-derived breast epithelial and breast cancer explant cultures (PDECs) grown in various three-dimensional matrix scaffolds, finding that ER&#945; is primarily regulated by the matrix stiffness. The finding that the matrix stiffness is a central cue to the ER&#945; phenotype reveals a mechanobiological component in breast tissue hormonal signaling and enables the development of novel therapeutic interventions. In our current study we have utilized the PDEC model to identify novel biomarkers that could predict the emergence of tamoxifen resistance in primary breast tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd634301-9e30-4365-ac90-e604f59b717c\/@r03B8ZMy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Preclinical,Tamoxifen resistance,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14444"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pauliina Munne<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iiris Räty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aino Peura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linda Patrikainen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denis Belitskin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juha Klefstrom<\/i><\/presenter>.

This drug class now plays a key role in supplementing or even replacing chemotherapies as first line treatments. Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) are just a few of the therapeutic strategies currently utilized to promote an anti-cancer response. Preclinical testing of current and novel immune modulators is necessary to expand our knowledge of these drugs and better predict their efficacy. Animal models have numerous deficiencies and complications that make them insufficient for accurate representation of human response, including an insufficient human immune system and a lack of genomic heterogeneity. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop preclinical models that incorporate human tumors and autologous immune cells together to create an accurate microenvironment for effective monitoring of tumor and immune cell interactions. We have developed a tumor-type agnostic platform in which 3D cell cultures are engineered with cells from resected human tumors. This <i>ex vivo<\/i> model not only recapitulates the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), but it includes multiple downstream read-outs to address a single question such as whether an agent or combination of agents stimulates an immune response resulting in an anti-tumor effect. Our model can incorporate tumor and immune cells directly from the TIME or tumor cells from patient-derived xenografts or organoids which are then supplemented with allogenic or autologous immune cells or even CAR-T cells. Immune response can be detected via T-cell activation, degranulation assays, and immune cell-mediated tumor cell killing which can be multiplexed with anti-tumor activity assays. We can measure a reduction in viable tumor cells via flow cytometry following treatment or at increasing effector to target cell ratios, detect fluctuations in production and secretion of granzyme B indicating T-cell cytotoxic activity, and evaluate reduced cell viability for synergy assessments of drug combinations. We have detected increased secretion of IFN&#947; with combination drug treatment compared to single agent treatment. Macrophage polarization can be monitored with co-culture of CD14+ cells with tumor cells in our system inducing an M2 phenotype from an M1 phenotype. Finally, we can detect dendritic cell maturation following stimulation by measuring increased expression of MHC class II and CD103. Taken together this model system supports complex cell-cell interactions necessary to detect immunotherapy response and represents an ideal preclinical testing platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cdbc5842-11cf-4428-b9cf-23b0ea7e84e7\/@r03B8ZMy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D cell culture,Immunotherapy,Preclinical testing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14445"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kathryn M.

There are several preclinical tools including patient derived cell lines, organoid and xenograft (PDX) models to assess the efficacy of drugs. However, it is important to recapitulate the complexity of human malignancy and immune contexture within the tumor microenvironment. Here we report, an <i>ex vivo<\/i> platform (3D-EXplore) using fresh patient tumor samples with intact stromal and immune cell components to assess treatment-mediated changes in molecular and transcriptional profiles of tumor resident immune cells using a Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) platform.<br \/>Methods: All tumor samples were obtained with patient consent and relevant IRB approval. Unpropagated 3D tumoroids measuring 150 &#181;m in size with intact tumor immune microenvironment were prepared from fresh tumor samples of colon and lung tissues using proprietary technology developed at Nilogen Oncosystems. No enzymatic digestion, propagation or reassembly was used during the preparation of the tumoroids. Hundreds of tumoroids originated from different parts of each patient&#8217;s tumor sample were pooled to represent the tumor heterogeneity and treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with or without immunostimulatory agents for 48h. Here, we applied multi-modal CITE-seq profiling using the 10X Genomics platform to interrogate cellular responses to <i>ex vivo<\/i> treatment. Culture supernatants were collected for multiplex analysis of cytokine release in media. Additionally, flow cytometry was used to assess the activation profile of resident immune cells.<br \/>Results: Following sequencing of FACS sorted viable CD45 populations, the FAST-Q output files were uploaded into Cell Ranger for analysis with Loupe Browser. Multimodal analysis of transcriptomes or proteomics at the single-cell level revealed significant changes in the top 100 gene expression levels specific to CD4 and CD8+ T cells, NK cells and B cells signaling and activation upon stimulation with immunostimulatory agents. In addition, several pro and anti-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines were upregulated in response to <i>ex vivo<\/i> treatment in both colon and lung tumoroids, which coincided with marked changes in the activation status of tumor resident immune cells, as detected by multiparameter flow cytometry analysis.<br \/>Conclusions: These results demonstrate Nilogen&#8217;s 3D fresh tumoroid model reflects the significant impact on activation and proliferation of tumor resident immune cells within the intact tumor microenvironment at the transcriptional level. We believe this model system can serve as a clinically relevant tool for accelerating immuno-oncology drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ex vivo,Human,Tumor,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14447"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jonathan P.

The two main histological subtypes are lung adenocarcinoma, which arises in the alveoli, and squamous cell lung cancer, which arises in the airways. <i>In vitro<\/i> models of squamous cell lung cancer have used human bronchial epithelial cells immortalized with Simian Virus 40 Large T antigen (SV40 LgT) or mutant<i> CDK4<\/i><sup>R24C<\/sup> combined with telomerase. The derived immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells have been very useful to study the effects of tobacco smoke exposure and oncogene activation. However, to date it has not been possible to develop similar models for lung adenocarcinoma; immortalized human alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) were not available due to the difficulty in establishing alveolar cell lines that proliferate yet remain epithelial. Here we describe a method to derive AEC lines, providing a new resource for <i>in vitro<\/i> lung adenocarcinoma models. We purified human AECs from de-identified remnant human transplant lungs from deceased subjects and tested numerous conditions to establish immortalized cell lines. We found that the addition of Rho-associated kinase inhibitor (Y27632) to culture media allowed AECs to proliferate so that they could then be transduced with lentivirus. Transduction with <i>CDK4<\/i><sup>R24C<\/sup> + telomerase did not yield cell lines that grew well. However, transduction with SV40 LgT resulted in well-proliferating cell lines that retained their epithelial morphology. In 2-dimensional (2D) culture the AEC LgT-expressing cell lines grow in cobblestone monolayers and do not express mature alveolar markers. However, in 3-dimensional (3D) culture in Matrigel with fibroblasts the cells form alveolar-like organoids of varying complexity. Immunofluorescence and single cell RNA sequencing indicate that the transition from 2D monolayer to 3D organoids is accompanied by the expression of mature alveolar markers such as aquaporin 5 (AQP5), G-protein-coupled receptor class C, member A (GPRC5A), lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 3 (ABCA3, involved in surfactant production). In addition, while in 2D culture the cells form a single cluster with homogeneous gene expression patterns, in 3D diverse cell groups appear. Using a 3D culture medium that stimulates alveologenesis induces additional mature alveolar markers. We are using AEC lines to study the effects of environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke and the role of lung cancer driver genes. In addition, we intend to establish AEC lines from individuals of diverse ethnicities to investigate the effects of genetic background on lung cancer development. Our AEC lines provide a valuable new system to model and study the distal lung and associated diseases <i>in vitro<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c269437d-9a76-48e7-94fa-fae95f49a92a\/@r03B8ZMy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Immortalization,Cell lines,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14499"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"72630b73-06fa-43d7-a26f-d68099fb43fa","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72630b73-06fa-43d7-a26f-d68099fb43fa\/@r03B8ZMy\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ite A.
