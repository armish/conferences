[{"Abstract":"Objective: Over 75% of patients with ovarian cancer present with widely metastatic disease. We have previously published that AXL is highly expressed in primary ovarian cancer tumors. However, it is unknown whether AXL expression in metastatic tumors correlates with outcome. Additionally, the role of stromally expressed AXL in metastasis has not been fully evaluated. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the role of tumor and stromal AXL in the key steps of tumor metastasis.<br \/>Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to measure AXL expression in a tissue microarray with primary and metastatic high grade ovarian tumors. Attachment assays as well as transwell and spheroid invasion assays were performed on established ovarian cancer cell lines. Mesothelial cell clearance assays utilizing human omentum-cultured mesothelial cells (HPMC) and additional invasion assays utilizing normal omental fibroblasts (NOF) were performed.<br \/>Results: 214 tumor samples were included from 139 patients: 122 primary and 92 metastatic sites, contributing to 85 matched samples. Most had high-grade serous histology (79%) and stage III-IV disease (79%). High AXL expression in metastatic tumors was associated with decreased overall survival (HRadj 1.8, 95% CI 1.03-3.1), but expression in primary tumors was not (1.1, 0.61-2.0). High vs. low AXL expression in metastases was associated with a decreased platinum-free interval (5.92 vs 15.9 months, P=0.03) and decreased progression-free survival (11.6 vs 18.8 months, P=0.02).Tumor AXL expression correlated with stromal AXL expression (R<sup>2=<\/sup>0.50, P&#60;0.001). Human ovarian tumor cells depleted of AXL had decreased attachment (OVCAR3-TPMES, 0.55-fold decrease P&#60;0.001) and invasion in transwell (OVCAR5, 173 vs 262 invasive tumor cells\/hpf, P&#60;0.01) and spheroid (ES2, 87% vs 31% area invaded, P&#60;0.0001) invasion assays. Human ovarian cancer cells plated on AXL-deficient HPMCs had less cell clearance than those plated on AXL-expressing HPMCs (ES2, 6.0 vs 3.9 normalized area cleared, P&#60;0.001). Further, human ovarian cancer cells plated on AXL-deficient NOFs had less invasion than tumor cells plated on AXL expressing NOFs (OVCAR5, 173 vs 262 invasive tumor cells\/hpf, P&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: High AXL expression in metastatic ovarian cancer cells correlates with worse survival and worse response to chemotherapy. Further, AXL expression in both tumor and stromal cells contributes to the steps of ovarian cancer metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/316560e5-926f-4c1a-96c7-f433b6b642dd\/@r03B8ZLW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Axl,Metastasis,Ovarian cancer,Stromal-epithelial interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11852"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mary Margaret Mullen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lillian N.

Diffuse migration and invasion into adjacent healthy brain tissue yields complete surgical resection of these tumors unfeasible. As a result, despite receiving maximal surgical resection and an aggressive course of chemoradiation, the majority of high-grade brain tumor patients suffer from recurrent disease. Increased expression levels of the homeostatic iron regulator gene (<i>HFE)<\/i> in high-grade brain tumors have been correlated with poorer outcomes. HFE is known to influence cellular iron metabolism by inhibiting transferrin-mediated iron uptake yet little is known regarding how HFE or iron impact the migratory capabilities of high-grade brain tumor cells. In order to better understand how <i>HFE<\/i> expression and cellular iron metabolism influence cell migration in high grade brain tumors, we utilized brain tumor cell lines that had been genetically manipulated to express different levels of <i>HFE<\/i>. We observed that knocking down <i>HFE<\/i> in KR158 or LN229 glioma cell lines resulted in significantly decreased migratory capacity. Since HFE is known to inhibit transferrin mediated iron uptake, we studied how directly modulating the iron status of glioma cells impacted their ability to migrate. Treatment of a panel of glioma cell lines: LN229, T98G, U87, KR158, with iron in the form of hemin or ferric ammonium citrate resulted in significantly reduced migration. Furthermore, the iron-induced reduction in migration could be rescued by the addition of deferoxamine, an iron chelator. Cell viability in response to the iron treatments was assayed and found to not be significantly altered - suggesting that cellular iron status was influencing migratory capacity independent of cell viability. To gain mechanistic insights into HFE and iron-induced effects on cell migration, we analyzed the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) for correlations between <i>HFE<\/i> and the Rho GTPases <i>RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42 <\/i>&#8211; genes which are known to play a crucial role in determining the migratory capacity of cancer cells. Interestingly, we found statistically significant correlations between the Rho GTPases <i>RHOA, RAC1, CDC42<\/i> and <i>HFE<\/i> in both grade III astrocytoma and glioblastoma patient cohorts. Immunoblotting of iron treated glioma cell lines demonstrated that expression of RhoA and Cdc42 was reduced suggesting that alterations in Rho GTPase expression and signaling may play a role in iron-induced effects on cell migration. Our results demonstrate that targeting cancer cell iron metabolism as an addition to existing treatment regimens may be a promising avenue for further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ce0eabf-a025-4877-88d0-53fa292012c6\/@r03B8ZLW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Migration,Iron,GTPase,Glioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11853"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ganesh Shenoy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie Troike<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kondaiah Palsa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madison Kuhn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quinn Wade<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Becky Slagle-Webb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Snyder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chachrit Khunsriraksakul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin D.

Although BrM is associated with all BC subtypes, but it is more prevalent in triple-negative and HER2+ BC patients. Recent advancements in the multimodality treatment of primary BC have prolonged patient survival, which has in turn increased the incidence of BrM. Due to the lack of understanding of BC-BrM, there is no reliable biomarker and effective therapeutic strategy. In this regard, using publicly available databases and RNA-Seq analysis, we observed that secretory mucin MUC5AC is significantly upregulated in BC brain metastatic cell lines and tissues compared to their respective control. We validated these observations in brain-seeking BC (BSBC) cell lines and brain metastatic tissues at protein levels. Interestingly, we found that the MUC5AC levels were significantly increased in the serum of CNS metastatic patients relative to healthy donors and BC patients. Our functional studies revealed that silencing of MUC5AC in BSBC cell lines showed a significant decrease in cell adhesion, migration, brain metastatic potential, and increased survival of mice. Exploring the molecular mechanism further revealed that MUC5AC interacts with CD44v6 and c-Met and deletion of MUC5AC demonstrated a decrease in the expression of c-MET and CD44v6. Furthermore, pharmacological targeting of MUC5AC through c-Met inhibitor reduces the expression of CD44v6 and MUC5AC, suggesting that c-Met inhibitors could be used as a novel therapeutics for targeting MUC5AC and thereby attenuating BC brain metastasis. Altogether, our study demonstrates that MUC5AC\/CD44v6\/c-Met axis could be used as a novel approach to prevent breast cancer brain metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e4c60170-6d8a-4aa0-9925-c819fb7859d8\/@r03B8ZLW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Breast cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11854"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shailendra Kumar Maurya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jawed A.

Novel agents that act on targetable driver mutations (EGFR, PI3K, etc.) and penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) have shown promise as systemic options for patients with distant lung and melanoma metastases. Nevertheless, brain metastases represent an area of unmet clinical need for which new pathways, novel mechanisms, and innovative therapies are needed. Cancer stem cells are thought to be a driving force behind not only distant metastasis, but also late-stage recurrence. The hedgehog pathway is an important mediator of breast cancer stem cells (BCSC); however, FDA-approved therapies targeting this pathway have demonstrated limited efficacy in breast cancer clinical trials. Despite advances made in understanding BCSC, it remains challenging to effectively target BCSC underscoring the need to identify and inhibit novel mediators of BCSC to treat BCBM. Our laboratory recently reported that truncated glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (tGLI1) promotes preferential breast cancer metastasis to the brain by activating BCSC and astrocytes in the tumor microenvironment (Oncogene 39:64-78, 2020). tGLI1 is an alternatively spliced GLI1 variant that functions as a tumor-specific gain-of-function transcription factor and terminal effector of the hedgehog pathway. tGLI1 knockdown abrogated BCBM, providing the rationale to therapeutically target tGLI1. In this study, we conducted cell-based chemical screens followed by validations and found that ketoconazole (KCZ), an FDA-approved antifungal, selectively targets tGLI1-expressing cancer cells, leading to suppression of BCSC <i>in vitro<\/i> and BCBM <i>in vivo<\/i>. Modification of KCZ moieties produced derivatives that retained tGLI1-selectivity against both BCSC <i>in vitro <\/i>and BCBM <i>in vivo<\/i> with increased BBB penetrance. Mechanistic studies suggest that KCZ-dependent cell kill is mediated through reducing tGLI1&#8217;s ability to bind and transactivate its target gene promoters, reducing expression of target genes <i>Nanog, OCT4<\/i>, and <i>VEGFA<\/i>. Based on these data, we opened an early Phase I clinical trial to determine if KCZ penetrates the BBB and modulates tGLI1 signaling in BCBM (NCT03796273). Preliminary analysis confirmed KCZ accumulation in collected brain biospecimens. We further investigated structure-activity relationship by synthesizing and testing 22 novel compounds, and identified two tGLI1-selective compounds that no longer inhibit CYP3A4. Since KCZ-mediated CYP3A4 antagonism can result in adrenal insufficiency and drug-drug interactions, these two novel tGLI1 inhibitors could be promising agents superior to KCZ. Collectively, these data establish tGLI1 as an actionable target for BCBM and validate KCZ and its novel derivatives as promising treatment options for patients with BCBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9e9f43cf-48be-4e1f-ac74-7f7126ce7f93\/@r03B8ZLW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Brain metastasis,Drug discovery,Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11856"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Doheny<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Manore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace L.

Mutations in the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway are common in PTC and ATC, especially in <i>BRAF, <\/i>with a prevalence of 40-60%. Despite the importance of the MAPK pathway in thyroid cancer, therapies targeting this pathway are not approved for <i>BRAF-<\/i>mutant PTC patients. While the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition is approved for patients with <i>BRAF<\/i>-mutant ATC, these patients often progress. An emerging mechanism of resistance to targeted therapies is an invasive phenotype switch in which cells transition from a proliferative, therapy sensitive population to an invasive, therapy resistant population. Here, we sought to determine whether increased invasion plays a role in resistance to BRAFi in <i>BRAF<\/i>-mutant PTC and ATC. In our panel of <i>BRAF-<\/i>mutant PTC and ATC cell lines with varying sensitivity\/resistance to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (BRAFi), we showed that cells resistant to BRAFi exhibit a 1.8 to 2.2 fold increase (p&#60;0.04) in invasion while sensitive cells do not. Using Reverse Phase Protein Array, we identified a 2.0-fold increase in the extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin (FN1), in response to BRAFi treatment. We further identified a 1.6 to 3.2 fold increase (p&#60;0.02) in FN1 secretion in resistant cell lines and found that conditioned media from BRAFi-treated resistant cells promotes invasion 3.8 to 5.7-fold (p&#60;0.0048). Accordingly, treatment with FN1 phenocopies BRAFi-treatment by increasing invasion 1.9 to 2.1 fold (p&#60;0.04), and depletion of FN1 blocks this increase in invasion. Resistant cells with depleted FN1 also fail to exhibit a BRAFi-induced increase in secreted FN1. MAPK pathway reactivation is a common mechanism of resistance to inhibitors of the MAPK pathway, which we have shown can be blocked by dual BRAF and ERK inhibition (Hicks, HM; McKenna, LR <i>et al. <\/i>Mol Carcinog. 60(3) 2021). ERK inhibition also mitigates the increase in invasion observed in response to single-agent BRAFi (p&#60;0.0014) or FN1 (p&#60;0.0271) in resistant cells. We further observed that dual inhibition of BRAF and ERK slows tumor growth <i>in vivo <\/i>in a BRAFi-resistant patient-derived xenograft model (p=0.02). <i><\/i> <i> <\/i> These data indicate that thyroid cancer cells resistant to BRAF inhibition exhibit a more invasive phenotype characterized by an increase in FN1 and a pro-invasive secretome. Dual inhibition of BRAF and ERK ablates this BRAFi-driven increase in invasion and slows tumor growth <i>in vivo, <\/i>providing a potential therapeutic strategy for <i>BRAF<\/i>-mutant thyroid cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49da26d9-2640-4429-a5d6-6e4609fdcc62\/@r03B8ZLW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Invasion,Drug resistance,MAPK signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11857"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hannah M.

The lack of effective therapy suggests that the precise molecular mechanisms underlying bone metastasis are still unclear. <i>Enhancer of zeste homolog 2<\/i> (EZH2) is considered a breast cancer oncogene and its expression is<b> <\/b>correlated with metastasis of breast cancer, but its function in bone metastasis has not been well explored. Herein we report that EZH2 promotes osteolytic metastasis of breast cancer through regulating transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#946;) signaling, a key pathway in bone metastasis. Knocking down EZH2 decreases bone metastasis incidence and outgrowth <i>in vivo<\/i>. EZH2 induces cancer cell proliferation and osteoclast maturation, when breast cancer cells are co-cultured with osteoblasts and osteoclasts together <i>in vitro<\/i>. Mechanistically, EZH2 increases transcription<i> <\/i>of<i> ITGB1<\/i>, which encodes for integrin &#946;1. Integrin &#946;1 activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which phosphorylates TGF&#946; receptor type I (TGF&#946;RI) at tyrosine 182, thus enhances the binding of TGF&#946;RI to TGF&#946; receptor type II (TGF&#946;RII), therefore activates Smad2 and increases parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH) expression. Clinically applicable FAK inhibitors but not EZH2 methyltransferase inhibitor effectively inhibits breast cancer bone metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>. Overall, our data signify integrin &#946;1-FAK as a new downstream effector of EZH2 in breast cancer cells, and EZH2-integrin &#946;1-FAK axis cooperates with TGF&#946; signaling pathway to promote bone metastasis of breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/44bd8ed7-92ad-4916-8d93-addf7fcdf2ed\/@r03B8ZLW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EZH2,Transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF-&#946;),Integrins,Bone metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11859"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lin Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingkun Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yutao Qi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yimin Duan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Wen Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhifen Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ping Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beibei Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuxing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dihua Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Moreover, we have previously identified an association of CIRBP with the invasive growth of parenchymal brain metastases. Using a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, in which cells implanted in the mouse mammary fat pad spontaneously metastasize to the leptomeninges, we identified CIRBP as being elevated in leptomeningeal metastases (LM) compared to matched primary mammary tumors. LM grow in the subarachnoid space that harbors the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The leptomeninges represent an inhospitable environment for disseminated cancer cells since the CSF is mitogen and nutrient poor. To investigate the importance of CIRBP for metastatic breast cancer cells in the leptomeninges, we stably reduced CIRBP expression in MDA-MB-231 cells and performed mammary fat pad and cranial injections. CIRBP knockdown had no influence on primary tumor growth, but diminished growth within the brain.<br \/>Hypothesis: We hypothesize that CIRBP functions as a stress response protein enabling cancer cells to grow in the harsh environment of the CSF.<br \/>Results: In response to various cellular stressors, such as hypothermia, hypoxia or UV irradiation, CIRBP can translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We show that culturing MDA-MB-231 cells in artificial CSF (aCSF) also causes CIRBP relocation from nucleus to cytoplasm. Using RNA-IP approaches, we have identified mRNAs bound by CIRBP in breast cancer cells treated with aCSF. Ultimately, we will determine whether any of the identified CIRBP-regulated targets contribute to the formation of LM. Finally, we have generated CIRBP variants that are confined either to the nucleus or the cytoplasm. We are currently assessing the ability of these compartment-restricted CIRBP proteins to promote the formation of central nervous system metastases.<br \/>Conclusions: We have identified CIRBP as a promoter of leptomeningeal metastasis. Our results have begun to reveal the mechanisms through which CIRBP mediates this process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd76687f-600c-4ba6-a354-722033fe4695\/@r03B8ZLW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,CIRBP,PDX,leptomeningeal metastases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11861"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rima Ezzeddine<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Dankner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Savage<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Hebert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Brothers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew G.

MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and MDMX is an E4 that promotes ubiquitination of MDM2 targets (however this is an understudied area). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) shows high MDMX\/MDM2 expression in all breast cancer subtypes. We identified that MDMX depletion reduces circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastasis of breast cancers with mtp53. Our ongoing objective is to determine the mechanisms of how MDMX promotes CTCs and metastasis, and the potential MDMX regulated ubiquitinated targets. In TNBC primary tumors, knockdown of <i>mdmx<\/i> correlates with reduced expression of the G protein coupled receptor, CXCR4. We used mtp53 expressing T47D ER+, and MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells and their derived CTC lines, and shRNA-mediated knockdown of MDM2 and MDMX derived lines, to address the potential MDMX targets. We assessed metastatic properties of migration and invasion changed by the knockdown of MDM2\/MDMX in parental and CTC cell lines using multi-faceted cell biological and biochemical approaches. Depletion of MDM2 in T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells increased the level of MDMX, demonstrating a critical function of MDM2 for regulating MDMX. MDMX depletion surprisingly did not change MDM2 levels, but did reduce the migration of both MDA-MB-231 cells and their derived CTC lines. Interestingly, the parental MDA-MB-231 cells migrated more rapidly in scratch assays, compared to both their derived CTCs and MDMX-depleted CTCs, suggesting migration to be critical for intravasation, but not for latter cancer cell survival. Experiments are in progress to address if loss of MDMX perturbs CXCL12 ligand communication with the CXCR4 receptor in parental and CTC breast cancer lines. Preliminary data suggests activated MDMX expression correlates with the activation of these metastasis signal transduction pathways. The ubiquitination targets of MDMX\/MDM2 in the parental and CTC cell lines are being defined by affinity purification in the presence, and absence, of MDMX\/MDM2, and add back of purified MDMX\/MDM2 to validate targets. As expected, purified MDMX increases MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and on its own MDMX is inert. Stable isotope labeling in cell culture suggested protein targets involved in DNA replication and repair pathways. This preliminary data informed our interest in studying DNA damage signaling by pharmacologically inhibiting the DNA repair protein PARP. We examined how MDMX\/MDM2 pathways respond to DNA damage caused by PARP inhibition. Our preliminary data affirms regulation of the MDMX\/MDM2 stress-response circuit by replication stress response pathways, and reveals the requirement of MDMX\/MDM2 for their function in the studied cell lines. Disrupting MDMX function has potential to be beneficial for inhibition of breast cancer progression and metastasis.

Commonly altered signaling pathways highlight the propensity for tumors to depend on such pathways for growth and survival where genomic alterations may not be required for pathway activation. The Raf family kinases are crucial mediators of the Ras\/Raf\/MEK\/ERK (MAPK) cascade, which has been shown to be upregulated in a subset of metastatic cancers and are mutated in many epithelial cancers. A recent study suggests non-mutated C-Raf can drive metastasis to the lungs, bone, and various other tissues (Faltermeir et al. 2016). Though the mechanism of C-Raf driven metastasis is likely through MAPK activation, C-Raf has been demonstrated to possess MAPK independent roles that may also contribute to this phenotype. In this study, we explored various C-Raf functions as drivers of metastasis in an intracardiac mouse model system. Using a series of Raf knock-out cell lines and mutants targeting functional residues in C-Raf, we demonstrated that C-Raf dimerization is necessary to drive metastasis. We further showed that the metastasis-promoting activity of C-Raf is dependent on co-expression of its family member, B-Raf, for an accelerated metastatic phenotype. However, overexpression of a kinase-dead C-Raf mutant was still able to produce metastases albeit with lower efficiency, suggesting C-Raf possesses non-kinase dependent functions that also contributed to metastasis. Together, these results point to the importance of Raf non-canonical roles in oncogenic processes that may be unappreciated in metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e94b85f0-3f3c-481c-a2b3-0538c20243d5\/@s03B8ZLX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Kinases,Signaling pathways,BRAF,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11863"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lisa H.

There remains an unmet need to identify patients likely to develop recurrence, and for innovative therapies to decrease this risk.<br \/>Methods: The prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs105266, which causes a missense mutation at codon 273 (Ala to Val) of the metastasis suppressor BRMS1 isoform 2 (BRMS1v2), was assessed using the TCGA cohorts of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and breast cancer, and validated in our LUAD cohort. Next, to explore the function of BRMS1v2 and the impact of BRMS1v2 A273V in LUAD, 3 distinct experimental systems were employed, including 1) Two LUAD cells stably expressing ectopic V5-epitope BRMS1v2 wild type (WT), or A273V mutant, by a retroviral system, 2) LUAD homozygous <i>BRMS1v2<\/i><sup>A273V\/A273V<\/sup> isogenic cells generated via a CRISPR knock-in approach, and 3) patient-derived LUAD organoids (PDO) with homozygous <i>BRMS1v2<\/i><sup>A273V\/A273V<\/sup>. The metastatic capabilities of LUAD cells and PDOs were evaluated by <i>in vitro<\/i> invasion chamber assays and two <i>in vivo<\/i> metastasis models: tail-vein injection and intracardiac injection. To interrogate the molecular mechanism of action, RNA-seq. and loss and gain of function experiments using genetic engineering and pharmacological inhibitors were performed.<br \/>Results: The homozygous rs1052566 (<i>BRMS1v2<sup>A273V\/A273V<\/sup><\/i>) is present in 8% of individuals of European ancestry and 28% of South Asians. Importantly, <i>BRMS1v2<sup>A273V\/A273V<\/sup> <\/i>is associated with an increased risk of metastases and a worse progression-free survival in patients with early-stage disease in the TCGA LUAD cohort (N=278). We<i> <\/i>mechanistically elucidated that BRMS1v2 A273V abolishes the metastasis suppressor function of BRMS1v2, promoting invasion and metastases. BRMS1v2 A273V fails to interact with nuclear Src, thereby activating intratumoral c-fos. Higher c-fos results in upregulation of <i>CEACAM6, <\/i>which drives metastases<i>.<\/i> Using a patient-derived organoid metastasis model, we repurposed a c-fos pharmacologic inhibitor investigated in clinical trials for arthritis and observed suppression of metastases in <i>BRMS1v2<\/i><sup>A273V\/A273V<\/sup> LUAD.<br \/><b><\/b><b> <\/b>Conclusion: Our data suggest that individuals harboring homozygotic <i>BRMS1v2<sup>A273V\/A273V<\/sup><\/i> have a predisposition for developing metastatic LUAD. Moreover, following external validation, <i>BRMS1v2<sup>A273V\/A273V<\/sup><\/i> could potentially serve as a biomarker to predict the development of metastatic disease in early-stage LUAD. Using a PDO metastasis model we show that pharmacologic targeting of c-fos in <i>BRMS1v2<sup>A273V\/A273V<\/sup><\/i> LUAD results in significantly less metastases <i>in vivo<\/i>.

The Eyes absent (Eya) family of proteins are transcriptional cofactors with both intrinsic tyrosine phosphatase and associated serine\/threonine phosphatase activities. In addition to developmental functions, Eyas have been shown to play a role in promoting many hallmarks of cancer. Published work from our laboratory demonstrated that Eya3 is capable of upregulating expression of PD-L1 in TNBC tumors thereby suppressing anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell responses, and preliminary data suggests that Eya3 may also regulate the expression of various cytokines in this context. In tumor cells, innate immune signaling pathways, such as NF-kB, have been shown to promote tumor progression, immune evasion, and metastasis in many distinct tumor types. We hypothesize that, in addition to regulating CD8+ T-cell responses, Eya3 regulates innate immune signaling in TNBC cells to facilitate enhanced primary tumor growth and metastasis. Preliminary findings suggest that Eya3 is a key mediator of tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC and a strong regulator of NF-kB signaling in this context. Further exploration is warranted to determine the mechanism through which Eya3 regulates these phenotypes, whether Eya3-mediated NF-kB activation is a major contributor to the pro-metastatic phenotype of Eya3, and whether Eya3 could serve as a therapeutic target for preventing or treating disseminated TNBC.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/93007791-81e1-4f5b-9f72-bb16b5517f90\/@s03B8ZLX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Metastasis,NF-&#954;B,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11865"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Connor J.

Metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has poor survival and chemotherapy pre- and post-surgery has been the standard treatment for decades. Polymorphonuclear - myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are implicated in the process of metastasis. IL-15 stimulates the proliferation and cytolytic activity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells and Natural Killer cells (NKs) and has been reported to have anti-metastatic activity. We have produced the native heterodimeric form of IL-15 (hetIL-15) which has advanced in clinical trials due to its anticancer activities. Here, we report the anti-metastatic effects of hetIL-15 alone and in combination with doxorubicin and surgery using the 4T1 mouse model of TNBC.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Study design and methods: <\/b>We studied the efficacy of the chemo-immunotherapeutic regimen with surgery in a neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting or without surgery. The animals were evaluated regarding metastatic disease and survival. The anti-metastatic effect was evaluated by examining the metastatic foci in lungs and the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood by histology and clonogenic assays. Treatment effects in immune populations in blood, spleen and lungs were evaluated by flow cytometry analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Mice treated with<b> <\/b>hetIL-15 in combination with doxorubicin had significantly better survival in comparison to monotherapy treatments and control group. H&#38;E histological analysis in the lungs revealed substantially fewer metastatic foci after hetIL-15 monotherapy, and even fewer in the combination group. Furthermore, clonogenic assays from lungs and blood, reinforced these findings showing significantly lower numbers of tumor colonies upon hetIL-15 monotherapy and combination treatment. Immune profiling evaluation of blood, spleen and lungs by flow cytometry and IHC revealed a significant systemic increase of cytotoxic effector cells (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells and NKs), combined with reduction of immunosuppressive populations (PMN-MDSCs) especially in the combination group. These findings suggest a synergistic effect of doxorubicin and hetIL-15 in controlling the metastatic disease. Lastly, hetIL-15 monotherapy or co-administration with doxorubicin, together with surgery, led to the cure of approximately 50% of the treated mice.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our results demonstrate that hetIL-15 reduces metastatic disease and synergizes with doxorubicin and surgery to maximize the effectiveness of the treatment against breast cancer in mice. We suggest that the effect of hetIL-15 on metastatic disease is both at the level of dissemination and also colonization in the metastatic sites. This should be further explored in the clinical setting as a neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy in combination with chemotherapy and surgery for the treatment of TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/820a7757-1d61-4ec4-bebe-0440018bd9a5\/@s03B8ZLX\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Metastasis,Circulating tumor cells,Surgical resection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11866"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vasiliki Stravokefalou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dimitris Stellas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sevasti Karaliota<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Breana Myers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina Bergamaschi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Konstantinos Dimas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara K.

Though there are various risk factors, the most common risk factor for cervical cancer development is sexual transmission &#38; persistent infection with high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Although most HPV infections are cleared naturally in women, persistent infection with high-risk HPV types promotes neoplastic transformation &#38; tumorigenesis. Furthermore, exposure of neoplastic cervical epithelial cells to inflammatory mediators may drive the progression of cervical cancer. Seminal fluid (SF), a biological fluid rich in inflammatory mediators &#38; growth factors, has been implicated in cervical cancer progression. SF has been shown to induce the expression of proinflammatory mediators which promotes cell proliferation in culture &#38; growth of explants in mice injected with HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells. Since majority of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinoma, in this study, we examined the effect of SF on cell proliferation, EMT, cell migration &#38; invasion employing SiHa and Me180 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. Our results showed that SF significantly enhanced cell proliferation in both cell lines. Using Confocal microscopy and phalloidin staining we further showed that SF caused morphological changes and stress fibre formation. RT-qPCR showed that SF up regulated EMT transcription factors Snail, ZEB1 &#38; TWIST mRNA expression. EMT induction was further confirmed by the increase of N-cadherin &#38; a subsequent decrease in E-cadherin protein expression. Additionally, we showed that the induction of EMT transcription factors by SF occurs via the EGF\/ERK\/COX pathway. To investigate the effect of SF on migration and invasion, transwell migration assays were used. Results showed that SF significantly enhanced cell migration &#38; invasion of the SiHa and Me180 cells. Our results show that SF plays a role in enhancing the migratory &#38; invasive potential of squamous cell carcinoma cells &#38; that this associates with increased expression of EMT transcription factors. These findings together implicate SF as a possible factor that may promote cervical cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c32415d9-b320-46a9-9615-d72ea5226b65\/@s03B8ZLX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Signal transduction pathways,Migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11868"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nonkululeko Mkwanazi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virna D.

Clinical and epidemiological studies shows that Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) patients have higher risk of developing invasive melanoma, and, reciprocally, patients with invasive melanoma have a higher risk of developing PD. Alpha-synuclein (&#945;-syn; <i>SNCA<\/i>), an intrinsically disordered protein expressed in neurons, is also highly expressed in malignant melanoma and is a common molecular signature between Parkinson&#8217;s disease and melanoma. We have previously reported that SK-Mel-28 <i>SNCA<\/i>-knockout (KO) cells exhibit suppressed tumor growth and proliferation <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i>, and that putting back <i>SNCA<\/i> via lenti virus restored the phenotype to that of the control cells. The present study is designed to investigate the role of &#945;-syn in melanoma progression in SK-MEL-28 cells in the context of metastasis and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The SK-Mel-28 <i>SNCA<\/i>-KO clones showed a significant decrease in the cell-surface protein L1CAM, a major cell adhesion molecule highly expressed in various melanoma and correlates with melanoma progression, whereas the knock in clones resembled the control. Migration and invasion assay were performed using transwell chambers showed a profound migratory and invasive defect in <i>SNCA<\/i>-KO clones. To explore further whether this is a proliferative or migratory defect, a single cell phagokinetic motility assay was performed with colloidal gold which showed a marked decrease in cell motility in knockout clones compared to control and knock in clones, which was consistent with our migration and invasion experiments.

It is far more aggressive than other breast cancer types due to a higher degree of metastases and frequent relapses following current treatment options. Integrin alpha10beta1 is a collagen binding receptor that has emerged as a promising new cancer target due to its role in tumor cell proliferation and migration. The aim of the present study was to investigate the function blocking activity of the human integrin alpha10beta1 antibody TARG10 on growth and metastasis of TNBC.We have found that integrin alpha10beta1 is highly expressed in TNBC, with minimal expression in healthy tissue, and that high expression is correlated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. In vitro studies showed significant inhibiting effects of TARG10 on the adhesion, migration, proliferation, and viability of TNBC cells. In an orthotopic xenograft TNBC model, TARG10 confirmed inhibitory effects on both tumor growth and metastasis as demonstrated by In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS-CT). The effect on metastasis was further demonstrated in a tail vein xenograft TNBC model of experimental metastasis. Pharmaceutical evaluation demonstrated excellent developability properties, including low post translational liabilities, high melting point, low aggregation and high yield.In summary, integrin alpha10beta1 represents a promising target for directed antibody-based therapy of TNBC. Our in vitro and in vivo data supports pre-clinical and clinical development of TARG10 as a candidate drug for treatment of patients with triple negative breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/089f2383-e84a-4737-9144-470f83cff526\/@s03B8ZLX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Antibody,Integrin alpha10beta1,Triple negative breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11870"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katarzyna Masoumi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoli Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Mirkov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristine Smedenfors<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Per Norlén<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evy Lundgren-Åkerlund<\/i><\/presenter>.

Isolation of MCAs from patient ascites correlates with poor patient survival and resistance to therapy. However, <i>the mechanisms promoting anoikis evasion and OVCA MCA formation in a-i are not fully understood<\/i>. Our previous data from patient ascites-derived cells, cell lines, and in vivo studies, demonstrate that OVCA cells upregulate the nutrient\/stress sensor SIRT3 in response to a-i. We further illustrated that SIRT3 is necessary for the activation of the primary mitochondrial dismutase, SOD2, which in turn promotes the mitochondrial antioxidant defense to maintain optimal survival in a-i. To identify additional key molecular players important for a-i survival downstream of SIRT3, we employed RNA sequencing analysis to compare the transcriptome of SIRT3 knockdown and wildtype cells in both attached and a-i conditions using the serous adenocarcinoma cell line OVCA433. Analysis of early transcriptomic changes, observed within 2 hrs as well as 24 hrs of a-i, revealed that RHOV, a recently identified atypical member of the Rho GTPase family, is the top gene significantly upregulated in a-i. SIRT3 knock-down significantly decreases RHOV expression in 24hr a-i conditions, implicating RHOV as a potential downstream target of SIRT3 signaling in a-i. RHOV was reported to be overexpressed in lung cancer and found to correlate with poor patient outcome and resistance to therapy. RHOV expression also regulates intercellular adhesion dynamics during development. Our data show that genetic silencing of RHOV expression interferes with the ability of OVCA cells to form MCAs in a-i, suggesting that increased expression of RHOV in a-i conditions acts as an adaptive survival advantage mediating cell-cell adhesion and MCA formation. Current work is exploring how RHOV regulates E-cadherin in this context, by focusing on p21-stimulated serine\/threonine protein kinase signaling. In addition, the mechanisms of SIRT3 dependent regulation are being explored by determining how changes in mitochondrial protein deacetylation contribute to RHOV transcription. This work highlights an expanding role of SIRT3 in mediating a-i survival of OVCA and explores the novel role of an understudied member of the Rho family of GTPases, RHOV during OVCA metastasis. Finally, given that the formation of MCAs has been correlated with resistance to therapy and increased rates of recurrence, we aim to test how MCA formation and targeting of key players of cell-cell adhesion in a-i, such as a RHOV, can be exploited for novel therapeutic strategies to prolong survival of OVCA patients diagnosed with metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8eda3900-b8a8-4581-911a-f12e237c5444\/@s03B8ZLX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anoikis,Metastasis,Multi-cellular aggregates,Rho-GTPases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11872"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amal T.

Despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), recurrence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) often occur due to constitutive AR signaling via both full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR splice variants, primarily AR-V7. Therefore, safe strategies to suppress both AR-FL &#38; AR-V7 expression in CRPC cells will be of significant benefit. Several plant-derived organosulfur compounds, e.g. sulforaphane and diallyl-trisulfide, can potently suppress AR expression in CRPC cells, but are yet to be clinically approved. We investigated whether dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) an approved organosulfur compound often used as a solvent for pharmaceutical agents, can similarly suppress AR levels in the CRPC cell lines, C4-2B and 22Rv1. Exposure to low dose DMSO (0.1-1%) was not cytotoxic to these CRPC cells, and less than 20% cytotoxicity was seen with 2.5% DMSO even at 96 h post-exposure. Interestingly however, DMSO dose-dependently suppressed AR-FL in C4-2B cells and both AR-FL and AR-V7 in 22Rv1 cells within 24 h post-exposure. Exposure to DMSO also downregulated the expression of hetero-nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1), which is known to regulate AR expression and splicing. Although DMSO exposure showed a dose- and time-dependent effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by PC cells, the AR-suppressive effect of DMSO was not altered by the antioxidant n-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Furthermore, although DMSO did not affect cell viability at these clinically-achievable concentrations, a significant (p&#60;0.01) decrease in the migratory ability of both CRPC cell lines was clearly evident. Our novel findings indicate that safe doses of DMSO may be used to decrease AR expression and metastatic ability in CRPC cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dca317ea-64f9-4d4e-91d3-841ff5271659\/@s03B8ZLX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Prostate cancer,Therapeutics,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11886"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Namrata Khurana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hogyoung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Talal Khan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shohreh Kahhal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amar Bukvic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asim B.

Clinically, PDAC patient tumors show high expression levels of multiple components of the coagulation system (e.g., tissue factor, etc.) and fibrinolytic system, including urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and receptor (uPAR). In addition, pancreatic cancer patients show elevated levels of circulating fibrinogen (Fib) and the fibrin degradation product D-dimer in plasma, with increased correlation in patients with distant metastasis. We hypothesized that targeting the plasminogen activation system components would disrupt PDAC tumor progression. Using pancreatic cancer cell lines from the KPC mouse model (K-ras<i><sup>LSL.G12D\/+<\/sup><\/i>; p53<i><sup>LSL<\/sup><\/i><sup>.<\/sup><i><sup>R172H\/+<\/sup><\/i>; Elas-CreER), individual components of the fibrinolytic system (uPA and uPAR) were eliminated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Knocking out uPA and uPAR in KPC cells resulted in significantly smaller tumors relative to Cas9 control tumors. Compared to WT mice, KPC murine pancreatic cancer cells injected orthotopically in Plg<sup>-\/- <\/sup>mice had significantly attenuated tumor growth, suggesting the pro-tumor effect of tumor cell-derived uPA\/uPAR expression was linked at least in part to plasmin(ogen) activation to enhance PDAC tumor progression. To further investigate the contribution of Plg or Fib in the microenvironment in PDAC progression, we used Plg or Fib specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment to specifically deplete plasminogen or fibrinogen levels in mice bearing human PDAC tumors. Treatment with Plg-ASO or Fib-ASO significantly decreased tumor burden in both orthotopic and subcutaneous models bearing human tumors. Bioluminescent imaging revealed that Plg-ASO and Fib-ASO treatment also decreased the spontaneous metastatic burden. Histological analysis of lung and liver tissue from Plg-ASO-treated mice confirmed reduced metastatic burden of the primary tumor, especially to the lungs. Similarly, Fib-ASO-treated mice had significantly lower metastatic burden in both liver and lung tissues. Our data demonstrate that depleting Plg or Fib in circulation reduces tumor growth and metastasis. Collectively, our data suggests the PA system is important to both tumor growth and metastasis. Based on our findings with Plg depletion, the unexpected finding that depletion of the plasmin target fibrin(ogen) in the microenvironment also significantly reduces primary tumor growth and metastasis suggests plasmin(ogen) may function through fibrin(ogen)-independent mechanisms to promote PDAC progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a781035-22de-4cbb-b8c9-2c7d9395af93\/@t03B8ZLY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic tumors,Cancer diagnostics,uPAR,uPA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18177"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nayela N.

This is attributed to the dormancy program acquired by disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone microenvironment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving dormancy &#38; reawakening (D&#38;R) can reveal novel therapeutic opportunities. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in each step of the metastatic cascade. Recent studies have shown upregulation of MMP-2 expression in D&#38;R. To determine whether MMP-2 plays a causal role, we initially developed a model representing dormancy in PC cell lines using basal growth conditions and high seeding density. The generated dormant cells (D-Cs) formed clusters and had negative expression of Ki-67 (98% of cells, p = 0.007), Low ERK\/P38 activity ratio (p = 0.002), and higher percentage of G0\/G1 arrested cells (p = 0.0004). The clusters can remain dormant and viable even after long-term culture (&#62;28 days). We observed that D-Cs can reawaken in-vitro by re-introducing serum-containing media. Next, we assessed MMP-2 expression in D-Cs and reawakened cells. We found MMP-2 expressed during entry into dormancy but highly upregulated during reawakening. Using a siRNA approach, we found that MMP-2 silencing prevented entry into dormancy by significantly inhibiting cluster formation and survival. To determine the role of MMP-2 in reawakening, we used a pharmacological approach due to the temporal nature of MMP-2 silencing by siRNA. Using a highly selective bisphosphonate-based MMP-2 inhibitor (ML115), we found that blocking MMP-2 activity prevented the reawakening of prostate cancer cells without impacting cell viability at 1&#181;M as assessed by caspase-3 cleavage via immunoblotting. In conclusion, we developed an in-vitro PC-specific model for dormancy &#38; reawakening. We found MMP-2 to be key for controlling entry and exit from dormancy in-vitro. We are currently elucidating the mechanisms through which MMP-2 mediates these effects. We also posit that our selective bone-targeting MMP-2 inhibitor may be effective in blocking the reawakening of dormant cells in-vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/16aaf590-d10c-4722-b39e-f8e985f11721\/@t03B8ZLY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Prostate cancer,Matrix metalloprotease,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18973"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mostafa Nasr<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

It was once thought that recurrence occurred within patients that harbored dormant breast disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in distant organs that were not present in patients that did not recur. Interestingly, a significant percent of patients harbor DTCs, yet many do not recur, raising the critical question, what differentiates patients that experience a recurrence versus those who live with dormant DTCs for the rest of their lives? It is likely the answer lies in both cell intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors. Nevertheless, the extreme rarity of dormant DTCs has been the major obstacle to their study. To overcome this challenge, we developed an efficient system to isolate and study rare dormant tumor cells from metastatic organs. Using this system and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified a group of genes differentially expressed in dormant breast cancer cells present in both bone and lung. While modulation of these genes individually had no impact on the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells, we found that as a group, these genes predicted the dormancy phenotype in murine breast cancer models. Importantly, expression of these genes in primary human breast cancer tumors correlated with disease-free survival, suggesting these genes have predictive value in determining which patients are likely to recur. Moreover, we explored extrinsic mechanisms that impact dormancy and found that the chemotherapy reagent doxorubicin (Doxo) drastically changed the microenvironment <i>in vivo<\/i>, which allowed dormant breast cancer cells to grow robustly within the visceral fat and this was further exacerbated by a high fat diet. Further, we found that Doxo treatment induces significant adipose tissue dystrophy and macrophage infiltration, which may contribute to dormant metastatic outgrowth. Our study provides novel insight into breast cancer dormancy, and also reveals microenvironmental changes that impact dormant breast cancer cell outgrowth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1bf61832-1777-4a24-baf2-4bea1b53d047\/@t03B8ZLY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Chemotherapy,Adipose tissue,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18975"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qihao Ren<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weng Hua Khoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiayu Ye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Douglas V.

Previous findings revealed that the adaptive immune system reduces growth of proliferative D2A1 tumors in Balb\/c versus SCID mice while dormant D2.1 tumors are largely unaffected by adaptive immunity, despite being significantly infiltrated by T cells. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the downstream effects and molecular underpinnings of dormancy-mediated alterations to the immune environment. Experiments were performed using two independent clones of a spontaneous mammary tumor from a female Balb\/c mouse that display varying degrees of dormancy <i>in vivo<\/i>. D2A1 cells grow rapidly upon orthotopic or systemic injection while D2.1 cells remain dormant long term in local and metastatic sites. Both cell lines were modified to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) for use with Just eGFP Death Inducing (JeDI) T cells which contain a T cell receptor (TCR) targeted to eGFP<sub>200-208<\/sub>. Adoptive transfer of JeDI T cells caused complete rejection of D2A1-eGFP tumors in the mammary fat pad (MFP), while no difference in growth was observed in D2.1-eGFP tumors. Interestingly, contralateral MFP implantation of D2.1-eGFP tumors resulted in a partial rescue of D2A1-eGFP rejection suggesting systemic immune suppression by distant, dormant tumor cells. Bulk RNA-sequencing of D2A1 and D2.1 tumors revealed significant upregulation of pathways associated with immune activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in dormant tumors. Further, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed an enrichment for signatures of mammary stem cells and luminal progenitor cells, as well as exhausted vs memory CD8 cells and T cell anergy, in D2.1 tumors. Of the top upregulated genes in D2.1 tumors, pleiotrophin (PTN) and Dickkopf WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor 3 (DKK3) were chosen for further investigation. Overexpressing PTN or DKK3 in D2A1 cells significantly increased MFP tumor growth in Balb\/c but not SCID mice. In addition, PTN or DKK3 overexpression altered both local and systemic T cell profiles, including decreased effector memory (CD62l-, CD44+) and increased na&#239;ve (CD62l+, CD44-) CD4 and CD8 cells. Humoral immunity was also affected, as indicated by decreased eGFP-specific antibodies in serum from mice bearing PTN or DKK3 overexpressing tumors. Conversely, knocking down PTN or DKK3 in D2.1 cells had the opposite effect on systemic immunity. Taken together, these data indicate that dormant tumors can resist antigen-specific killing by CD8 T cells despite high T cell infiltration, and possibly suppress antigen-specific immunity in distant tumor sites. Moreover, both PTN and DKK3 emerge as potential mediators of dormancy-induced immune evasion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a398f506-a247-48ec-8afe-06a6abcdc015\/@t03B8ZLY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Breast cancer,Tumor immunity,Tumor Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18976"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy N.
