[{"Abstract":"S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2) is a promising drug target as studies have demonstrated that Skp2 is required for spontaneous tumor development that occurs in the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), Pten, or p53 deficient mice. We, therefore, aim to establish CRISPR human <i>Skp2<\/i> (h<i>Skp2<\/i>) knock-in in the prostates of mice to study the molecular profiling features in prostate carcinogenesis. Prostate weights increased in transgenic mice and overexpression of hSkp2 induced prostatic lesions including hyperplasia, mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN), and carcinoma, which suggested the initial role of hSkp2 in early prostate carcinogenesis. RNAseq results revealed <i>Myl3<\/i> and <i>Ctgf <\/i>as the top down-expressed and up-expressed genes respectively in hSkp2 mice prostates. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated the significant upregulations of ribosome and proteasome pathways which had similar alterations in the human prostate cancer dataset with Skp2 overexpression, suggesting the potential role of ribosome biogenesis in prostate tumorigenesis and for drug development. In addition, Skp2 organoids derived from transgenic mice prostates were being developed for convenient and efficient screening of specific Skp2 inhibitors. Flavokawain A (FKA) and Skp2 inhibitor C1 both selectively decreased the viability and altered the morphologies of hSkp2 organoids, meanwhile FKA exhibited less toxicity on wild-type organoids.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/69e984c2-e7d5-4e62-89eb-8aa3fcb984ca\/@E03B8ZKs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-01 Animal models in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate tumor,Skp2,RNA-seq,prostate organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14159"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liankun Song<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vyvyan Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shan Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jana Yamak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kia Arabzadehkaffash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Fazelpour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Merci Mino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Tippin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuang Meng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolin Zi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus, there&#8217;s an urgent need to explore and develop new CSC targeting agents. Flavokawain A (FKA), a novel chalcone from kava plant, can selectively inhibit the growth of pRb deficient cell lines and result in a proteasome-dependent and ubiquitination-mediated Skp2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) degradation, while the potential of FKA to target PCSC is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of FKA on PCSC self-renewal both <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. FKA treatment decreased both size and numbers of the tumor spheroids growing from CD44+\/CD133+ tumor stem cells, which were sorted out from the prostate tumor cell line DU145 and 22RV1. Expression of the stem cell markers Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 were all downregulated in the cancer spheroids treated with FKA. Growth of the 22RV1<sup>CD44+\/CD133+<\/sup> xenograft tumors was significantly inhibited in FKA diet-fed mice compared to the vehicle control diet-fed mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed less positive Ki67, Nanog, and Oct4 cells in tumor tissues from the FKA dietary group than those from the control dietary group. These results demonstrated that FKA can inhibit prostate cancer stemness and suggested a potential role of FKA for preventing prostate cancer recurrence by targeting PCSC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5128f6ab-b0af-43ca-9496-85bb19934dfc\/@E03B8ZKs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biological and biochemical mechanisms in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Cancer stem cells,Flavokawain A,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14162"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liankun Song<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Merci Mino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jana Yamak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vyvyan Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derron Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Pham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Fazelpour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vinh Le<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongjun Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Tippin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolin Zi<\/i><\/presenter>.

In addition to promoting insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon secretion, GLP1 acts via the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) to reduce gastric emptying and food intake. Therefore, development of GLP1R agonists appears to be a promising therapeutic option for type 2 diabetes. To evaluate the efficacy of GLP1 analogs in preclinical studies, Biocytogen has successfully generated a novel humanized GLP1R (B-hGLP1R) knock-in mouse line to support related drug development studies. In this mouse model, the full coding sequence of the human <i>GLP1R<\/i> gene was inserted into the mouse <i>Glp1r<\/i> gene locus. Human <i>GLP1R<\/i> mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR in B-hGLP1R mice but not in wild-type mice. Protein expression of human GLP1R in B-hGLP1R mice was confirmed by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry using pancreatic tissues. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis of leukocyte subpopulations showed that B-hGLP1R mice do not exhibit a change in the overall development, differentiation, or distribution of immune cell types in the spleen, blood, and lymph nodes. Additionally, our <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy study confirmed Dulaglutide, a GLP1 receptor agonist, reduced the non-fasting blood glucose, fasting blood glucose, glucagon, and food intake levels in B-hGLP1R obese mice and increased plasma insulin and GLP1 secretion. In B-hGLP1R mice, glucose tolerance (GTT) was also improved by Dulaglutide treatment, similar GTT results were observed after treatment with PF-06882961, a phase II agent specifically recognizing human GLP1R. Altogether, B-hGLP1R mice provide an efficacious preclinical animal model to evaluate novel GLP1 based therapeutic drugs.

Previously we demonstrated the utility of Nexrutine (Nex) as a neo-adjuvant with radiation. Nex was safe and well tolerated in PCa patients and potentiated radiation response in part through downregulation of ribosomal protein S6K (encoded byRPS6KB1). We now show that RPS6KB1 depleted prostate cancer cells with higher basal levels of &#947;-H2AX, a marker for DNA double strand breaks (i) are more sensitive to radiation and (ii) form smaller tumors with reduced levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Depletion of RPS6KB1 hindered DNA double-strand break repair predominantly through the alternate end-joining pathway, induction of G2\/M checkpoint and NF&#954;B pathway activation. Collectively these events led to improved radiation sensitivity. We further identified Berberine (Ber), one of the active constituents of Nex as a potential pharmacological inhibitor of RPS6KB1. In an orthotopic implantation model of C4-2B, treatment with Ber alone or Ber plus radiation decreased PSA levels that was sustained during the course of the experiment. On the other hand animals treated with radiation alone developed recurrent cancer as evidenced by a resurgence of PSA. Animals administered Ber followed by XRT intervention had increased levels of RANTES while there was no change in animals that received XRT followed by Ber. The observed reversal of the Bereffect with the sequence of intervention is statistically significant (p=0.0298). Among animals not subject to XRT, the mean PSA increased in those that did not receive Ber relative to those that did; mean difference=-1.93, 95% CI -3.75 to -0.105, p=0.04 with no significant changes in body weight. Notably,RPS6KB1 mRNA levels increased in tumor samples in patients experiencing biochemical recurrence(BCR). Given that rising PSA following conventional therapeutic approaches such as radiation remain a major clinical challenge, targeting RPS6KB1 signaling with radiation therapy is an attractive strategy to prevent BCR.

With more than a dozen known mutations in colorectal cancer, and growing knowledge about different efficacy of drug options dependent on biomarker status, biomarker testing and results can aid in more effective and lifesaving treatment planning specifically for the unique characteristics of each individual&#8217;s tumor. However, biomarker testing in colorectal cancer remains low, and the Colorectal Cancer Alliance aims to increase knowledge and awareness of testing among patients and their care teams.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In 2019, the Alliance conducted an online survey to assess patient, survivor, and caregiver knowledge and understanding of biomarker testing. To further understand identified gaps, the Alliance recruited a diverse set of patients and caregivers at various stages of the colorectal cancer journey for a focus group to explore understanding around biomarkers, treatment pathways, biomarker testing decisions, and gaps around current testing and re-testing processes. Working with a multidisciplinary expert Advisory Committee, the Alliance utilized findings from the survey and focus group to plan a 2021 Summit focused on identifying solutions for known barriers.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Summit participants discussed innovative and evidence-based solutions focused on three audiences: patients, caregivers, and cancer care team members, to close some of the gaps identified previously. Patient solutions focused on developing standard resources that explain biomarker testing and results and updating telehealth infrastructure to allow for clear, transparent notes, patient engagement, and shared decision making. Caregiver solutions focused on clearly defining the role of the caregiver and updating telehealth infrastructure to allow for caregiver support in the journey. Cancer care team solutions focused on creating standard health literacy standards, becoming better advocates for biomarker testing, and creating multidisciplinary discussion opportunities between health professionals.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> It is critical that we put swift solutions in place with efforts to improve resources, shared language, infrastructure, and advocacy to empower cancer care teams, patients and caregivers alike to receive guideline-concordant biomarker testing, make informed treatment decisions accordingly, and understand the choices and discussions at each step.<br \/><b>Acknowledgments:<\/b> The 2021 Colorectal Cancer Biomarker Think Tank was made possible by the support of our sponsors: Founding Sponsor Pfizer, as well as Amgen, Daiichi-Sankyo, Seagen, Merck, and Mirati Therapeutics.

CEL demonstrate time- and dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity against H1299 and A549 cells with IC50 0.63 and 1.8 &#181;M, respectively and shows dose dependent inhibition of A549 colony formation. CEL has minimal effect against the normal bronchial epithelium Beas2b. We have also demonstrated that CEL loaded onto bovine milk-derived exosomes (ExoCEL) enhanced therapeutic response vs. the free CEL in tumor xenograft model and lacks systemic and immunotoxicity. Our data indicate that the wound healing and cell migration rate was significantly reduced in the CEL treatment. In fact, the effect was time and dose dependent as analyzed by Wimasis software. CEL is an inhibitor of TAK1 and has shown to suppress basal TGF-&#946;1 and TNF-&#945; induced NF-&#954;B activity, however, the precise mechanisms remain to be identified. Here, we systemically explored the mechanism of CEL by which it inhibits the growth and metastasis of NSCLC using RNAseq analysis. RNAseq followed by differential expression of genes demonstrate a total of over 600 genes modulated by the CEL treatment of which 287 genes were upregulated while 314 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis, genome analysis along with reactome pathway enrichment analyses indicated that CEL-treated genes are involved in cell cycle, EMT, PI3K-AKT and p53 signaling and pathways related to lung cancer and its metastasis. The molecules of major pathways involved in the RNAseq analysis were analyzed by western blot. Our findings indicated significant decrease in TGF&#946;-induced migratory behavior of cancer cells and reversal of TGF&#946;-mediated changes in EMT proteins such as ZO1, Vimentin, &#946;-catenin and claudin by CEL in H1299 lung cancer cells. Cancer cells exhibited up-regulated N-cadherin with loss of E-cadherin called the \"cadherin switch\" and downregulation of E-cadherin is one of the hallmarks of EMT. We also confirmed that CEL inhibit TGF&#946;-induced cMyc expression by decreasing PI3K and AKT phosphorylation via TGF-&#946;\/non-Smad pathway and show dose- dependent reduction of pAKT, PI3K, cMyc and Smad4 in the absence and presence of TGF-&#946;. In summary, the analysis of biological functions of the most differentially expressed genes revealed possible mechanisms of CEL for its strong activity against lung cancer. Pathways identification provide information about the potential use of CEL to inhibit tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis of lung cancer.

The reclassification of patients across clinically relevant subgroups, such as low risk\/intermediate risk\/high risk, is considered the best metric to estimate potential utility. However, data from clinical decisions demonstrates that the &#8220;all-or-nothing&#8221; approach to threshold-based decisions is, in practice, incorrect. Here we present a novel approach to assessing biomarker utility, the change in intervention probability (IP). The intervention probability curve (IPC) models the likelihood that a provider will choose the intervention as a continuous function of the risk of disease. To assess the impact of adding a new biomarker, the change in likelihood of intervention is calculated for each patient based upon their change in risk. The summary statistics of the change in likelihood of intervention over the population can be descriptive of the expected clinical impact of the added biomarker.<br \/>Methods: An IPC for lung cancer diagnosis based upon the Mayo Clinic Model was derived from the National Lung Screening Trial. Each patient&#8217;s baseline intervention probability to undergo a diagnostic bronchoscopy for an indeterminate pulmonary nodule (IPN) was calculated based upon their Mayo risk. Their post-test IP was calculated using a new biomarker strategy incorporating a blood test (CYFRA 21-1), a quantitative radiomics signature, and patient clinical history assessed in 457 patients with IPNs between 6-30 mm). The bias-corrected clinical net reclassification index (cNRI) was calculated as the comparator method for estimating biomarker utility.<br \/>Results: Based upon ACCP risk thresholds of 0.05 and 0.65, the cNRI was 0.08 for the control population and -0.003 for the case population. Interestingly, despite greatly improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC of 0.754 improved to 0.855), the cNRI shows a very modest improvement in the control population and no improvement in the case population. However, the results of the IPC analysis show that over the entire population, there would be a net decrease in interventions among the control population of 8.3%, and a net increase in interventions among the case population of 0.8%.<br \/>Conclusions: Analysis of the change in probability of intervention provides a more informative perspective of which patients would benefit from the addition of the combined biomarker method.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3f1011cb-eb95-47e0-b20f-5840b2feb706\/@F03B8ZKt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Biomarkers,Diagnostic marker,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14168"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Nolan Kammer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dianna J.

Tumors are thought to be heterogeneous at the single-cell level involving cancer stem cells. Therefore, cancer diagnosis and treatment are difficult because single cells might have intrinsic functional and genetic heterogeneity. Single cell transcriptome is used for mapping the genetic heterogeneity of a tumor. Currently, no model is available to provide a genotype to phenotype correlations for the heterogeneity, a crucial step for successful treat of a cancer. Here, our focus is to develop a single-cell clonal spheroid model system as a valuable tool for studying functional heterogeneity, including growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and genetic heterogeneity.<br \/><b>Material and methods:<\/b> HNSCC cell lines namely, UMSCC-22B, FaDu and A-253, and patients derived primary cells were cultured in 96-well ultra-low attachment to develop spheroids. Spheroids were cultured from 2, 4 and 128 cells per well with media, growth factors and supplements. Confocal microscopy was done using cocktail dyes including Hoechst, Calcein-AM and Ethidium bromide to check the functionality of spheroids.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We have established a method for the development of single-cell derived clonal spheroids. The frequency of spheroids formation from 2, 4 and 128 UMSCC-22B cells per well were higher than FaDu and A-253 cell lines. The growth measurement showed clones of single cell derived spheroids with hyperproliferation as well as with low proliferative activity. UMSCC-22B and A-253 hypoproliferative spheroids had significant higher migration capabilities compared to spheroids with hyperproliferative activity. Confocal microscopy of single-cell derived clonally propagated spheroids revealed a different zone <i>viz <\/i>proliferating, quiescent and necrotic zone in intact spheroids. This condition mimics <i>in vivo <\/i> conditions and suitable tool for drug penetration studies.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Together, our results suggest that single cell-derived clonal spheroid from different wells would represent the genetic and functional heterogeneity of the cell population. Such a spheroid model can reveal heterogeneity inside a tumor formed by the proliferation of a single-cell and heterogeneity between tumors resulting from a different single cell and thus has great potential for drug discovery and tumor biology research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f5c4968f-ca13-4b6d-b03d-1ccc7e0039d5\/@F03B8ZKt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-04 Cellular models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Spheroids,Tumor heterogeneity,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14169"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jyoti Pandey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ritis Shyanti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjay V.

Epidemiological studies indicate prolonged breast feeding reduces breast cancer (BC) risk, including TNBC. AAW have significantly lower rates of breast feeding compared to Caucasian women. To understand this link we developed a mouse model mimicking abrupt (AI) and gradual involution (GI). AI led to increased estrogen signaling, cell proliferation and chronic inflammation, which was followed by hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia in mammary glands<sup>1<\/sup>. There was an increase in the luminal progenitor (LP) cell population, the cells of origin of TNBC, and a decrease in mature luminal (ML) cells in AI glands. In this study, we sought to determine if blocking estrogen signaling with tamoxifen (TAM) could revert the negative effects of AI, and if so, could be a prophylactic option to reduce BC risk in women who do not breast feed.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Uniparous<b> <\/b>FVB\/N mice (~8 weeks) were allowed to nurse six pups per dam at partum. To induce AI, all pups were removed on postpartum (PP) day 7 (d7). For TAM treatment, 5mg sustained release TAM citrate pellet or placebo was implanted in the subscapular region on PP d8. Mammary glands were harvested on PP d28 and d120. FFPE sections were used for histology and immunohistochemistry. Single cell suspensions were analyzed for mammary epithelial subpopulations using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting. Affymetrix and qPCR were used for gene expression analysis. Mass cytometry was performed on mammary glands harvested at PP d120.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> TAM treatment for 21 days completely abrogated hyperplastic and metaplastic changes in AI glands harvested on d120. Treatment initiation on PP d8, d15 and d35 had the same effect. TAM treatment reduced the cell proliferation and collagen deposition in AI glands. De-enrichment of estrogen signaling pathways and decrease in Elf5 expression, a luminal progenitor marker, were observed upon TAM treatment in d28 glands. Mass cytometry revealed a marked reduction in LP population and a significant increase in ML population in TAM treated AI glands on d120, restoring to the levels in age matched virgin mice. Significant increases in progenitor-like markers TSPAN8, Ly6D, CD200 and decreases in CD49f and CD47 expression in LP cells were observed, indicating return to a normal uniparous LP state. Expression of Ly-6D in ML cells, a ML cell marker, was also rescued upon TAM treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Using<b> <\/b>our mouse model of AI and GI, we show that suppression of estrogen signaling after initiation of AI offered marked protection against precancerous changes. TAM restored the balance of epithelial lineages and normalized the LP and basal cells in AI glands to the post-involution phenotype. Our data provide a rationale for considering short-term TAM treatment for women who do not breastfeed to reduce risk of BC. 1. Basree et.al.

Socially isolated breast cancer survivors have a 43% higher risk of recurrence and a 64% higher risk of breast cancer-specific mortality than socially integrated survivors. Since Covid-19 has dramatically increased the incidence of social isolation, it is important to determine if social isolation affects the response to endocrine therapy and\/or recurrence after the therapy is completed. Since previous studies indicate that social isolation increases circulating inflammatory cytokines, we investigated if an anti-inflammatory herbal mixture Jaeumkanghwa-tang (JGT) prevents the adverse effects of social isolation on breast cancer mortality. Estrogen receptor positive mammary tumors were initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. When a rat developed a palpable mammary tumor, it was either socially isolated (SI) by housing it singly or a rat was allowed to remain group-housed (GH). Tamoxifen (340ppm via diet) or tamoxifen + JGT (500ppm via drinking water) started when the first mammary tumor reached a size of 11 mm in diameter. Tamoxifen administration ended when a complete response to this therapy had lasted for 9 weeks (corresponds to 5 years in women). During tamoxifen therapy, social isolation non-significantly reduced the rate of complete responses to 21%, from 31% in GH group (p&#62;0.05). After the therapy was completed, SI significantly increased local mammary tumor recurrence (p&#60;0.001; 45% GH vs 75% SI). RNAseq analysis was performed in the mammary glands. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of transcriptome showed that the increased recurrence risk in socially isolated rats was associated with an enrichment of IL6\/JAK\/STAT3 signaling: this result was confirmed in the tumors. In addition, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway was suppressed: the suppressed genes included those involved in mitochondrial pyruvate transport and conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA as well as genes in the TCA cycle and mediating electron transport in mitochondrial complexes I-IV. Social isolation also increased the expression of inflammatory receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) (p&#8804;0.05). Consumption of an anti-inflammatory JGT inhibited IL6\/JAK\/STAT3 signaling, upregulated OXPHOS signaling and prevented the increased risk of mammary cancer recurrence in socially isolated animals. The percentage of recurrences in the SI rats dropped from 75% without JGT to 22% with JGT (p&#60;0.001). Breast cancer mortality among socially isolated survivors may be most effectively prevented by focusing on the period following endocrine therapy using tools that inhibit IL6\/JAK\/STAT3 inflammatory cytokine signaling and correct disrupted OXPHOS and mitochondrial dysfunction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a1aa3e07-4526-4c20-b0db-2b4ed00eb4ca\/@F03B8ZKt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biological and biochemical mechanisms in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stress response,Tamoxifen resistance,Breast cancer,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14218"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fabia De Oliveira Andrade<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Clarke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Imani Wood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>MaryAnn Dutton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chezaray Anjorin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Rubin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Surojeet Sengupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin FitzGerald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leena Hilakivi-Clarke<\/i><\/presenter>.

Chief among these concerns are imperfect sensitivity and specificity, particularly pre-diagnosis and after tumor resection, when ctDNA burden is low. Cell death, either through apoptosis or necrosis, has been the most widely accepted mechanism of DNA release. Recent studies have also suggested active release through extracellular vesicles as a paradigm for DNA release. However, this pathway remains highly debated in terms of its contribution, mechanism, and even credibility. To address the deficiencies in ctDNA detection in the clinic and the lack of basic mechanistic knowledge of cf\/ctDNA release, we performed an <i>in vitro<\/i> CRISPR screen on MCF10A cells to identify regulators of DNA release. This normal breast epithelial cell line was chosen because MCF10A cells release DNA into cell culture media with a similar fragmentation pattern to that observed in human blood. After lentiviral infection with the genome-wide Brunello CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library, the population of knockouts identified in the genomic DNA of cells attached to the plates was compared to the population of knockouts found in the DNA released into the cell-depleted culture media. Genes with skewed representation were considered potential regulators of DNA release. Our analysis identified several genes in the TRAIL apoptotic pathway including <i>FADD<\/i>, as well as several genes encoding RNA-binding proteins including Sam68. Knockout of Sam68 and FADD in MCF10As, MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, and NCI-H841 lung cancer cells lead to decreases in DNA release. Previous studies have hypothesized that the fragment size of released DNA is dependent on release mechanism. However, the decreases observed in our knockout cell lines were not limited to a specific fragment size of DNA. Application of the small molecule apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK also recapitulated the DNA release phenotype seen in our knockout cell lines. From these results, we conclude that apoptosis is the major source of DNA release from cancer cells, and that fragment size is not the indicator of release mechanism it has been presumed to be. Mechanistic studies of DNA release such as this could lead to the ability to modify the amount of ctDNA in circulation, which would significantly improve accurate detection in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/42b111da-2f2b-4c97-97e0-f82f7bea0bef\/@F03B8ZKt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-04 Cellular models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Cell-free DNA,CRISPR,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14219"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brad A.

The chronic low-grade inflammation that often accompanies obesity is purported to promote these adverse outcomes. In obesity, remodeling of visceral white adipose tissue contributes to an inflammatory state via increased immune cell recruitment and production of proinflammatory cytokines. The aim of this study in a mouse model of obesity and colon carcinogenesis was to compare the effects of weight loss versus treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (sulindac) on tumor development and adipose and tumoral transcriptional changes. Azoxymethane (10 mg\/kg) was intraperitoneally injected weekly into FVB\/N male mice for 5 weeks to induce colon tumors. Mice were then randomized to an ad libitum 10 kcal% fat diet (control, n=20) or 60 kcal% fat diet to promote diet-induced obesity (DIO, n=55). After 15 weeks, DIO mice were randomized again to receive for an additional 7 weeks either: a) DIO diet (n=18); b) DIO diet supplemented with 140ppm sulindac (DIO+Su, n=19), or c) 10 kcal% fat control diet to generate formerly obese (FOb-LFD) mice (n=18). Mesenteric fat and colon tumors were collected for an Affymetrix Clariom D mouse gene expression microarray (n=5-6\/group). FOb-LFD mice, but not DIO+Su mice, lost significant body weight and body fat. Relative to DIO mice, tumor burden and multiplicity were lower in control, DIO+Su, and FOb-LFD mice. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the Hallmark gene sets revealed strikingly concordant transcriptional changes in the control, DIO+Su, and FOb-LFD mesenteric fat depots compared with DIO mice. Of the 8 immune related gene sets, 7 were uniformly suppressed (Normalized enrichment score (NES) &#62;1.66, FDR q&#60;0.05) across all groups relative to DIO. Moreover, compared with DIO, metabolism gene sets (e.g., FATTY_ACID_ METABOLISM, GLYCOLYSIS) were significantly enriched (NES &#62;1.45, FDR q&#60;0.05), and none were suppressed in control, DIO+Su, and FOb+LFD tumors. Tumor transcriptional changes were less coherent with EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION and COAGULATION being the only gene sets commonly suppressed across all groups relative to DIO. A leading-edge analysis revealed that <i>Lum, Pthlh, Sfrp4, Mmp8, <\/i>and <i>Serpine1<\/i> were commonly suppressed amongst tumors from groups other than DIO mice. Both weight loss and sulindac impeded the effects of chronic obesity on colon tumorigenesis. GSEA analyses of immune related gene sets indicated that weight loss and sulindac effectively suppressed inflammation in the adipose tissue but not in the tumor. The conserved immunological and metabolic transcriptional programs in the adipose tissue relative to the tumor suggests the possibility that paracrine signaling from the adipose to the tumor may underpin the observed beneficial effects of these interventions on obesity-driven colon tumor growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1724bb47-447d-4139-8f8a-e445b91147c2\/@F03B8ZKt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Colon cancer,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14224"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elaine M.

Using repeated measures of food frequency questionnaires, we calculated empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) and empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) scores which are food-based indices that characterize dietary inflammatory or insulinemic potential based on circulating biomarkers of inflammation or C-peptide, respectively. Cox regression was used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for type 1 endometrial cancer risk.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We documented 1,468 type 1 endometrial cancer cases over 2,544,615 person-years of follow-up. Diets with higher inflammatory or insulinemic potential were associated with increased risk of type 1 endometrial cancer in the Nurses&#8217; Health Studies. In the pooled multivariable-adjusted analyses, women in the highest EDIP or EDIH quintile had 1.66 times (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.40-1.97) and 1.57 times (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.33-1.86) higher risk of type 1 endometrial cancer, respectively, compared to women in the lowest quintile. However, additional adjustment for body mass index (BMI) attenuated the associations (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.96-1.37 for EDIP; HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85-1.21 for EDIH), suggesting adiposity may mediate the association of these dietary indices with type 1 endometrial cancer risk. In subgroup analyses, we observed a significant interaction by BMI (P-interaction&#60;0.01), where a significant direct association with EDIP was evident in women with BMI between 27 and 30 (HR<sub>Q5vs.Q1 <\/sub>1.47; 95% CI 0.92, 2.35; p-trend=0.02), but not among normal weight or obese women.

We and others have identified enhanced lipid metabolism as an important metabolic pathway in tumors of different etiologies. This &#8220;gain of function&#8221; contributes to malignant transformation in various malignancies, including brain tumors. Paradoxical to these findings, a high-fat\/low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) has demonstrated anti-tumor activity, both alone and in combination with radiation therapy (RT). Therefore, using our novel patient-derived GBM stem cell models, we sought to define mechanistic underpinnings contributing to this disconnect from a metabolic perspective. As an initial investigation, we fed&nbsp;<i>ad libitum<\/i>&nbsp;standard diet (SD) or KD alone or in combination with hypofractionated RT (hfRT; 6 Gy x 3) to mice injected orthotopically with aggressive GBM tumor cells. Consistent with previous reports, mice fed a KD demonstrated independent anti-tumor activity and potent synergy with RT compared to mice fed a SD. To provide a window into the metabolic consequences of KD in GBM, we performed global metabolomic profiling on tumors and serum from mice fed a SD and KD. Although ketosis was confirmed, no change in glucose was observed in serum of KD mice, suggesting carbohydrates might not be contributing to the observed anti-tumor activity. Interestingly, profound intra-tumoral metabolic changes were observed in tumors from mice fed a KD, with an accumulation of unsaturated fatty acids emerging as a central metabolic node differentiating KD and SD, which was consistent with serum studies. To begin to understand the biologic consequence of these findings, we recapitulated these findings in culture conditions <i>in vitro.<\/i> Intriguingly, culturing GBM cells with the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) linoleic acid demonstrated anti-proliferative activity, decreased clonogenic capacity, and synergy with RT in, recapitulating <i>in vivo<\/i> findings. This was not observed when cultured with the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid. Through a series of investigations, we went on to identify lipid storage homeostasis played a contributory role in the differential activity of these different classes of fatty acids. Specifically, we discovered that long-term storage within lipid droplets was less efficient for PUFA, leading to an increase free fatty acid accumulation in cells and lipotoxicity. The anti-tumor activity of PUFAs were rescued following inhibition of lipolysis. These studies collectively reaffirm and provide mechanistic underpinnings of the antitumor activity of KD, suggesting enhanced FA metabolism in brain tumors may serve as an exploitable metabolic vulnerability through diet modification. In addition, it provides a framework to potentially modify this diet to both enhance its antitumor activity and improve tolerability to allow for clinical implementation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/571efaf9-8aac-4a7f-883a-a7f2d6c6fd3d\/@F03B8ZKt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Diet,Fatty acids,Radiation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14227"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shiva Kant<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pravin Kesarwani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prakash Chinnaiyan<\/i><\/presenter>.
