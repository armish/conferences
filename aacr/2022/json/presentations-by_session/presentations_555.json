[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>Adjuvant cisplatin-vinorelbine is standard therapy for stage II\/III lung cancer. Poor survival in lung cancer can be attributed to vinorelbine resistance arising from ABC sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) and phosphorylated Fyn (pFyn) overexpression. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Nrf2 regulates the cell-protective ABC family and activates nuclear transport of Fyn. Here, we aimed to evaluate the ROS-Nrf2-ABCB1 axis in both vinorelbine-resistant (VR) cells and clinical samples.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We established VR cells by exposing H1299 cells to vinorelbine, and determined intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level of H1299 cells induced by vinorelbine using DCFH-DA. We evaluated the total and subcellular expression of Nrf2, ABCB1, and pFyn in VR cells and performed immunofluorescence of VR cells to confirm the precise subcellular localization of pFyn. Cell viability assay was used to examine whether the sensitivity of VR cells to vinorelbine depends on Nrf2 activity. For immunohistochemistry, we used 104 tissue samples from lung cancer patients who underwent surgery followed by cisplatin-vinorelbine treatment between December 2006 and June 2018.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Persistent exposure to vinorelbine induced intracellular ROS formation of H1299 cells. Both ABCB1 and Nrf2 were overexpressed in VR cells, and ABCB1 expression was dependent on Nrf2 downstream activation. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence revealed nuclear accumulation of pFyn in VR cells. Decreased expression of Nrf2 restored the sensitivity of VR cells to vinorelbine. In the 104 surgical samples, Nrf2 and ABCB1 were significantly associated with disease-free survival (<i>p<\/i> = 0.029 and 0.035, respectively), and pFyn was associated with overall survival (<i>p<\/i> = 0.040).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>ROS-Nrf2 upregulates ABCB1 and accompanied by nuclear accumulation of pFyn, induces vinorelbine resistance. Our findings may facilitate drug resistance prevention strategies or new drug target development against non-small cell lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a15cb45-b1cc-493d-80c7-e81002d37137\/@x03B8ZTy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-03 Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Nrf2,ABC transporters,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17991"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"26bd511e-6eb9-48ac-895e-33df9603abb1","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/26bd511e-6eb9-48ac-895e-33df9603abb1\/@x03B8ZTy\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shigeyuki Tamari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshi Menju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshiya Toyazaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideaki Miyamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naohisa Chiba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Misa Noguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Date<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus, there is an urgent need for increasing patient response to treatment. A common characteristic among most pancreatic cancer patients that could serve as potential target for treatment, is the biomechanically abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME). This altered TME is characterized by an increased stiffness which among others, is responsible for the development of mechanical stresses in the tumor interior. Even though several studies have investigated the effect of mechanical stress on cancer cells and tumor progression, it has not yet defined whether it can affect drug sensitivity and what are the mechanisms involved.<br \/><b>HYPOTHESIS:<\/b> Based on our recent findings, obtained by a Reverse Phase Protein Assay, we observed that mechanical stress activates a resistance response, employing autophagy activation, in pancreatic cancer cells. To this end, we hypothesize that mechanical stress developed during tumor growth, can induce autophagy activation to eventually promote drug resistance in pancreatic tumors. Therefore, inhibition of this mechanism can improve therapy.<br \/><b>METHODOLOGY:<\/b> We use two pancreatic cancer cells lines, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1, to apply mechanical stress, either in a 2D experimental setup or by employing tumor spheroids in a 3D agarose matrix. In both cases, cells are exposed to the most common chemotherapeutic agents used for pancreatic cancer treatment, gemcitabine and 5-Fluorouracil (5FU). The cytotoxic effect of each drug, as well as autophagy- and signaling pathway- activation are then analyzed. Finally, <i>i<\/i><i>n vitro<\/i> assays and treatments, along with <i>in vivo<\/i> animal models of pancreatic tumors, are performed to test the efficacy of an autophagy inhibitor combined with chemotherapy and a mechanotherapeutic that modulates intratumoral mechanical stresses.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> Proteomic analysis, together with pharmacological inhibition and siRNA treatments, revealed that mechanical stress activates autophagy to impair cell apoptosis and promote cancer cell survival. This stress-adaptation mechanism in turn impairs the cytotoxic effect of both gemcitabine and 5FU. A combined treatment employing chemotherapy with an autophagy inhibitor, and a mechanotherapeutic agent, showed promising results in increasing the overall-survival of pancreatic tumor-bearing mice.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> Our results provide solid evidence that alleviation of intratumoral mechanical stresses with mechanotherapeutics combined with autophagy inhibitors can improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3b066579-3aa2-4bf3-a915-8a02561d571c\/@y03B8ZTz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-03 Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Autophagy,Drug resistance,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21448"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Kalli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruxuan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ioannis K.
