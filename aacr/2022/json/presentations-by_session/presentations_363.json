[{"Abstract":"The protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia- mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) is an important component of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) and a key mediator of the replication stress response (RSR). ATR is recruited to and activated by single-stranded DNA, which commonly forms as a consequence of replication stress (RS). ATR activation and signaling coordinates a multifaceted response to RS, however if left unresolved, replication forks may collapse, form double-strand breaks (DSB), lead to chromosomal rearrangements and eventually cell death. Several chemotherapeutic agents act by increasing RS in tumor cells, by directly damaging the DNA and\/or depleting cellular resources required for DNA replication. Increased RS may also result from activation of oncogenes that drive dysregulated replication, a hypoxic environment, or from defects in other repair pathways even in the absence of exogenous DNA damaging insults. Inhibition of ATR activity in cancer cells disables the RSR, potentially enhancing the cytotoxicity of DNA damaging interventions and causing efficacy as monotherapy against tumors with reliance on ATR activity. M1774 is a potent inhibitor of ATR protein kinase with high selectivity towards other protein kinases. A broad range of antiproliferative activities (ranging from ~20 nM to &#62;1 &#181;M) was observed in a cancer cell line panel in vitro. M1774 showed pronounced synergy in combination with several DNA&#8209;damaging drugs and inhibitors of the DNA damage response. In vivo efficacy studies confirmed the combination potential suggested from in vitro studies. Pronounced combination benefit with complete tumor growth inhibition\/ regression was observed in combination with different chemotherapies or targeted DDR pathway inhibitors. Furthermore, M1774 showed pronounced activity as monotherapy in tumor models with gene mutations that result in a reliance on ATR activity. Clinical evaluation is ongoing to investigate M1774 as monotherapy and in combination with niraparib in patients with advanced solid tumors (DDRiver Solid Tumors 301, NCT04170153).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fdf2e3a5-2f5a-40c1-942e-aad264d9d18a\/@D03B8ZEM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,ATR,Replication stress,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12953"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Astrid Zimmermann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heike Dahmen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Grombacher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrich Pehl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andree Blaukat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Frank T.

Regarding treatments, surgery is possible in only 20% of cases, and the chemotherapeutic molecule Gemcitabine is unfortunately lacking a good response rate. Recently, a new polychemotherapy oxaliplatin-based (FOLFIRINOX), which is a combination of 4 drugs: oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin, has been approved. It has showed a significant increase of the overall survival inpatients compared to gemcitabine, but associated with more toxicity and still limited efficiency. Most of the drugs induce their toxicity by provoking DNA damages and replication stress, leading to the activation of DNA repair pathways. In this context,our research project proposes to find a synergistic association of FOLFIRINOX with specific inhibitors of DNA damage repair -Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related inhibitor (ATRi)- to increase the efficiency of the chemotherapy while reducing itstoxicity. The resistance to chemotherapy can come from the stroma that represents up to 80% of the tumor mass. The impact of the chemotherapies on the microenvironment can be a key to increase the treatments efficiency. That&#8217;s why in this project, we studied co-culture models to look at the effect of this new polychemotherapy on tumor cells and its microenvironment, in particular Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). Viability matrix in 2D &#38; 3D<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vitro<\/i> co-culture of tumor cells with primary CAFs were carried out. DNA damage and proteins from the DNA damage repair pathways were analysed after treatments. Cell death and autophagy pathways were studied.<i> <\/i><i>In<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vivo<\/i>, immunodeficient mice xenografted with ATCC and Patient Derived Xenograft models were treated with FOLFIRINOX and ATRi to evaluate the effect on tumor progression. A synergistic effect of the association was demonstrated<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vitro<\/i> independently of the KRAS, ATM, TP53, BRCA1\/2 mutation statuts in several pancreatic models (ATCC and derived from PDX) and in co-culture with CAFs. A higher apoptosis and DNA damages were observed in tumor cells treated with the associated drugs. These results were associated with a decrease of DNA damage repair pathways leading to more apoptosis compared to the chemotherapy alone and an inhibition of the autophagy flux. Also, a phenotypic change in the cells was found after treating with ATRi and with an increase of this particular phenotype when the chemotherapy was added. A protective effect of the CAFs on tumor cells was observed and CAF secretome was analysed.<i> <\/i><i>In<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vivo<\/i>, the association inhibits significantly the tumor growth compared to each treatment alone and no toxicity was observed. Now, validation of this polychemotherapy<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vivo<\/i> using co-culture models in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice are crucial to confirm the therapeutic potential of this new treatment for PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bf0fe924-ae79-40d0-aa69-015a4b185e2f\/@D03B8ZEM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,DNA damage,DNA repair inhibition,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12954"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"93db994b-fa1a-4505-9ece-cd894b53b34e","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/93db994b-fa1a-4505-9ece-cd894b53b34e\/@D03B8ZEM\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marine Bruciamacchie<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadia Vie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Véronique Garambois<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diego Tosi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre-Emmanuel Colombo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Céline Gongora<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christel Larbouret<\/i><\/presenter>.

Many OS samples have demonstrated a high proportion of mutational signature 3 (ms3), suggestive of homologous recombination DNA repair deficiency (HRD) or a BRCAness molecular phenotype. The HRD score, which quantifies chromosomal structural rearrangements by combining loss of heterozygosity (LOH), large state transitions (LST), and telomere allelic imbalances (TAI), has been used to assess HRD status in patients with breast and ovarian cancer, with high scores found to be predictive of PARP inhibitor sensitivity. While high HRD scores have been described in OS, little is known about how HRD scores vary by stage, site, pre vs post-therapy, presence of homologous recombination pathway or TP53 alterations, and their correlation to ms3 contribution.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To address this issue, we evaluated 48 OS samples with tumor purity &#8805; 20% from 46 patients who had 80x whole genome sequencing (WGS) performed through our pediatric expanded genomics platform. HRD scores were then estimated using scarHRD, a computational tool, which quantifies LOH, LST, and TAI events from WGS data and has shown a good correlation to SNP-array based methods.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of the 48 samples analyzed, 25 samples were from primary sites and 23 from metastatic sites of disease. The median HRD score was 45 with a minimum score of 6 and a maximum score of 79. The 25<sup>th<\/sup>, 75<sup>th<\/sup>, and 90<sup>th<\/sup> percentiles of values were 35.7, 57, and 66.3 respectively. There was a significant difference in HRD score in patients with localized disease (n=22) vs metastatic disease (n=26) at time of diagnosis with median HRD (mHRD) scores of 41 and 51.5 (p = 0.027). The presence of a TP53 structural variant or single nucleotide variant (mHRD=47) was associated with higher HRD scores than TP53 wild-type samples (mHRD=29.5, p=0.04). There was no statistically significant difference in HRD scores in pre vs post-treated samples or primary site vs metastatic site samples. Samples with homologous recombination pathway alterations (n=10) were not associated with increased HRD score. There was a positive correlation (Spearman&#8217;s rho=0.425, p=0.001) between the number of mutations attributed to ms3 and HRD score.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The range and distribution of HRD scores in our OS cohort closely resemble BRCA1\/2 deficient breast cancer. Patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis were found to have higher HRD scores, representing a higher degree of genomic instability and increasing potential to accumulate resistance mutations. Higher HRD scores in TP53 mutated samples may be due to chromosomal instability caused by mechanisms other than HRD. The BRCAness phenotype in OS is now being targeted in a phase II clinical trial, combining the PARP inhibitor olaparib with the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib (NCT0441706), which includes integrated correlative biology to prospectively assess biomarkers of response such as HRD score.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aa7db2a8-a1d8-429a-af56-b48878928835\/@D03B8ZEM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Homologous recombination,Biomarkers,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12955"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael David Kinnaman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Pena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Max Levine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nancy Bouvier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elli Papaemmanuil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne Forrest<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Janeway<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Meyers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Glade Bender<\/i><\/presenter>.

Wee1 is a crucial cell cycle checkpoint kinase that regulates the G2\/M checkpoint in response to DNA damage, and its inhibition can cause mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 are highly selective and potent inhibitors of Bcl-2 and Wee1, respectively. We show here that the combination is highly active in preclinical models of AML.<br \/>Methods: Cell proliferation in tumor cell lines and AML patient&#8217;s samples were measured using CellTiter-Glo&#174; (Promega). Relevant markers were measured by Western blotting. Anti-tumor efficacy was determined in cell line derived subcutaneous xenograft models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in an AML patient-derived systemic xenograft (PDX) model. Flow cytometry was used for analysis of the PDX model to measure human AML blast populations.<br \/>Results: The in vitro combination of ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 was tested in AML cell lines and showed synergistic or additive anti-proliferative activity which was independent of BCL-2 sensitivity in some cases. In addition, ZN-d5 in combination with ZN-c3 had a synergistic anti-tumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i> in cell line-derived AML models, such as MV4-11 and HL-60. Also, the triple combination of ZN-d5 + ZN-c3 + azacitidine in the HL-60 <i>in vivo<\/i> model resulted in synergistic anti-tumor efficacy and significant tumor growth inhibition compared to single- and double-agent treatments. The ZN-d5 + ZN-c3 combination was also tested <i>in vitro<\/i> in 29 AML patient-derived samples. Response to ZN-c3 alone was observed in 23\/29 samples (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 450 nM), independent of TP53 mutation status. Response to ZN-d5 alone was observed in 17\/29 samples (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60;200 nM). The combination resulted in synergy being observed in 12\/29 models and had greater anti-proliferative activity than either single agent alone in all samples including those insensitive to Bcl-2 inhibition (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 10 &#956;M). Combination of ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 was also highly active in an AML patient-derived PDX model, resulting in a 99.5% decrease in human CD45<sup>+<\/sup> blast population in the bone marrow. Finally, the combination of ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 was active in 3\/3 <i>ex vivo <\/i>experiments of patients derived AML samples who had progressed on venetoclax.<br \/>Conclusions: These results justify testing the ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 combination or possibly the triple combination including azacitidine in AML patients independently of TP53 status. Due to synergism observed with these combination(s) and activity in samples from patients resistant to venetoclax, activity may be seen in patients with low sensitivity to Bcl-2 inhibitors or even in patients who progressed on venetoclax plus azacitidine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f176a5cb-6f36-41c1-adb7-f94f5884184f\/@D03B8ZEM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"WEE1,Bcl-2 protein family,Acute myeloid leukemia,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12956"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hooman Izadi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiffany Hoang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noah Ibrahim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Pinchman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brant C.

Our group previously reported that the oncogenic roles of cyclin E are primarily a consequence of the accumulation of several truncated forms, collectively termed low-molecular-weight cyclin E (LMW-E). LMW-E isoforms provide a growth advantage by inducing early G1 to S phase transition, genomic instability, increased cell proliferation and metastasis, as shown in breast cancer cell lines and transgenic mouse models. Clinically, assessment of 2,500 breast cancer patients has revealed that LMW-E expression in tumors is associated with a high risk of recurrence across all subtypes. Further, LMW-E expression is an independent predictor of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Current gaps in knowledge in the field that remain pertain to (i) if LMW-E is an early or late event in oncogenesis (ii) if it is required for both the initiation and maintenance of mammary tumors, (iii) the secondary oncogenic events induced by LMW-E and if these events can be targeted therapeutically.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To address the above questions, we generated three tetracycline-inducible LMW-E (TLMW-E) transgenic model systems with expression of mammary specific human LMW-E in different genetic backgrounds: These include a bi-transgenic model (MMTV-rtTA and Tet-O-LMW-E), a tri-transgenic (bi-transgenic in a p53+\/- background) and quad-transgenic (tri-transgenic in a cyclin E knockout background). For each model, TLMW-E mediated tumor initiation, progression and metastasis, is reported as a function of time.

In homologous recombination (HR) deficient cancers like those with BRCA1\/2-mutations, inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has shown improved mortality compared to older gold standard therapies like DNA damaging agents. Unfortunately estimates upward of 40% of patients develop resistance to PARP inhibitor monotherapy during the course of their treatment. We explored potential synergistic drug combinations to re-sensitize tumors with acquired PARP inhibitor resistance in pancreatic and colorectal cancer. We hypothesized that dual inhibition of the DDR pathway through PARP and Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) inhibition would combine synergistically especially in cell lines with existing HR deficiencies through a synthetic lethality-mediated response. The ATR inhibitor Ceralasertib was selected for its potent antagonism of the DDR pathway, a key pathway associated with cell survival through DNA repair. Pancreatic and colorectal cell lines were carefully selected based on their varying mutational profiles to study differences in response to dual treatment. CellTiter-Glo&#174; (CTG) was used after drug treatment to quantify IC-50. CTG synergy and combination indices were used to study drug combinations, and western blotting identified changes in protein expression among key mediators of cell survival and apoptosis. Colony forming assays and cytokine profiling using Luminex technology (and single cell cytokine profiling) were performed to study changes within the tumor microenvironment. We observed strong synergy and cytotoxicity in addition to increased apoptosis and cellular disassembly following treatment with dual ATR+PARP inhibition compared to monotherapy alone. Western Blot showed upregulation of cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase 8 with combination therapy, and cytokine profiles provided insights into immune-suppressive versus stimulatory TME after drug treatment. There is potent synergy when ATR inhibitors are added to PARPi therapy in the context of pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Ongoing research efforts are further characterizing the mechanisms underlying these observed synergies in the same and additional tumor types such as prostate and ovarian cancer.<br \/><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd18cac9-9d39-4931-b323-f8c209e1718b\/@D03B8ZEM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Homologous recombination,PARP inhibitors,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12958"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna M.

Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), driven by the enzymatic function of DNA-PK, is one of the critical pathways employed to repair such DSBs. Inhibition of DNA-PK kinase activity impairs NHEJ, potentiates the activity of DNA-damaging agents, and inhibits survival of tumor cells incapable of repairing DSBs via other means, including homologous recombination (HR). We have developed an orally bioavailable, highly potent, and selective pharmacological inhibitor of DNA-PK activity, ZL-2201, for the treatment of cancer. ZL-2201 demonstrates enzymatic inhibition of DNA-PK in the single-digit nM range, with nearly 500-fold or greater selectivity against other phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). In addition, ZL-2201 showed high selectivity for DNA-PK kinase activity in a kinase panel screening study and a clean off-target profile with no appreciable inhibition against a panel of diverse, safety-relevant targets<b>.<\/b> We demonstrate that ZL-2201 effectively inhibits DNA-PK autophosphorylation and its downstream target phospho-RPA in multiple cell lines in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. DNA-PK has been shown previously to have synthetically lethal interactions with ATM. Therefore, we profiled the impact of ATM expression on the antiproliferative effects of ZL-2201. Cancer cell lines possessing defects in ATM displayed greater sensitivity to ZL-2201 compared to ATM-WT cancer cell lines. These observations were recapitulated in two ATM knockout isogenic cell lines. Moreover, ZL-2201 displayed minimal effects in a DNA-PK deficient model or in normal human and canine colon and kidney cell lines. Independent of ATM status, ZL-2201 showed strong synergy in vitro with topoisomerase II inhibitors. Following oral administration of ZL-2201 in vivo, ZL-2201 demonstrated dose-dependent and exposure-dependent antitumor activity against multiple models, with the greatest activity against ATM deficient human cancer xenografts. Antitumor activity correlated with duration of ZL-2201 exposure and level of target engagement. In addition, ZL-2201 significantly enhanced the activity of DNA-damaging agents in vivo, even in human cancer xenograft models with limited monotherapy antitumor activity for ZL-2201. The projected human PK properties, based on the ADME properties across species and PK properties in preclinical species of ZL-2201, suggest that ZL-2201 is suitable for oral administration. In conclusion, ZL-2201 demonstrates potent and selective inhibition of DNA-PK enzymatic activity, strong synergy with DNA damaging agents in vitro and in vivo, antitumor activity against multiple human xenograft models, and a favorable projected human PK profile. ZL-2201 is expected to enter clinical development in 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA-PK,Anticancer therapy,DNA damage response,Nonhomologous end joining,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12959"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shruti Lal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bee-Chun Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil Bhola<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivian Morton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shanghua Xia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haoyu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiuping Ye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petter Veiby<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>David I.

Consequently, blocking DNA-PK kinase activity is a novel anti-cancer therapeutic strategy in combination with ionizing radiation (IR). Towards developing a new class of DNA-PK inhibitors, our laboratory has exploited the mechanism of DNA-PK activation which requires binding to DNA termini via the Ku 70\/80 heterodimer. We have previously reported the development of Ku-DNA binding inhibitors (Ku-DBi&#8217;s) that act via this novel mechanism of action to inhibit DNA-PK catalytic kinase activity. Ku-DBi&#8217;s display nanomolar activity <i>in vitro<\/i>, possess cellular DNA-PK and NHEJ inhibitory activity and sensitize non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to DSB generating chemotherapeutics bleomycin and etoposide. In this study, we demonstrate that pre-incubation of our novel Ku-DBi&#8217;s can potentiate the cellular effects of bleomycin and IR and also induce p53 phosphorylation through the activation of the ATM pathway, which is concomitant with a decrease in DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation events at the S2056 (pS2056) cluster. Using a combination of Western blot and immunofluorescence assays in the NSCLC NCI-H460 and A549 cell lines, Ku-DBi&#8217;s treatment in combination with DNA DSBs-inducing agents such as bleomycin and IR, showed a significant reduction of autophosphorylation events of DNA-PKcs at the S2056 cluster compared to<b> <\/b>DNA DSBs-inducing agent alone. In addition, analysis of phospho-ATM and phospho-p53 protein levels in these NSCLC cell lines, suggested activation of the ATM pathway as a function of Ku-DBi&#8217;s treatment followed by bleomycin, evidenced by an increase of phosphorylation of ATM at Ser1981, and a modest increase of p53 phosphorylation at Ser15. Our findings demonstrate that Ku-DBi&#8217;s block DNA-DSB dependent DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation, resulting in potentiating cellular sensitivity to bleomycin and IR, and a likely effect on the ATM-dependent signaling pathway. These data are consistent with Ku-DBi&#8217;s possessing a novel mechanism of action that abrogates autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs to impact DSB repair and potentially DDR signaling, becoming in a promising approach as part of an anticancer therapeutic strategy in combination with DNA DSBs-inducing agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/faabb709-92ae-4c7f-8480-93fe73113d1e\/@D03B8ZEM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,DNA double-strand break,DNA damage response,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12961"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pamela L.

Though the overall 5-year survival rates have recently improved to 10%, there is still an unmet need for better therapies. PARP inhibitors (PARPi)\/platinum therapies have demonstrated clinical efficacy in <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>mutated PDAC and has recently led to the FDA approval of PARPi (olaparib) in the maintenance setting, offering the best personalized treatment approach for such patients. Although promising, the benefits of these therapeutic strategies are currently limited to only a few patients. We have recently established that BARD1 (<u>B<\/u>RCA1- <u>A<\/u>ssociated-<u>R<\/u>ing-<u>D<\/u>omain-1), the main binding partner of BRCA1 in regulating homologous recombination repair is upregulated in PDAC cells exposed to PARPi\/platinum compounds, by a post-transcriptional RNA binding mechanism. We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of BARD1 will sensitize cells to these agents. We found that inhibition of BARD1 (both by siRNA\/shRNA and CRISPR-KO) not only sensitized the cells to olaparib or oxaliplatin but enhanced DNA damage in cells, as analyzed by comet assays and &#947;-H2AX immunofluorescence staining. BARD1 inhibition led to a decrease in homologous repair efficiency of cells as analyzed by the well established pDRGFP assay. To further understand BARD1 dependent downstream signaling, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis of BARD1 silenced cells compared to scramble control. RNA seq analysis revealed modulation of several cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage response pathways. Notably, through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we found that silencing BARD1 causes de-enrichment of pathway regulating Polo-Like-Kinase-1 (PLK1, a serine\/threonine kinase) activity (p-val=0.05, FDR=0.07). PLK1 is frequently upregulated in PDAC cells and promotes progression of cells through mitosis. Based on these results, we found that a PLK1 specific inhibitor (onvansertib) synergized with olaparib to reduce cell survival of homologous repair proficient (HR-P) PDAC cells. Importantly, the mechanism of drug synergy involved induction of apoptosis and DNA damage, as assessed by cleaved caspase-3 and &#947;-H2AX protein analysis. These results are suggestive of targeting the BARD1-PLK1 axis in order to enhance sensitivity of PARPi\/platinums in HR proficient cells. Our ongoing and future studies are aimed at understanding the interaction of BARD1 and PLK1 in PDAC cells and analyze the effects of onvansertib and olaparib on tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Accomplishment of these studies will establish novel therapeutic targets and synthetic lethal combinations that have not been explored yet for deadly pancreatic cancers, ultimately benefiting patient survival in the long run.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/829a81b6-7a6a-472a-9cce-1ccf22ecbc57\/@E03B8ZEN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,PARP inhibitors,Homologous recombination,Polo-like kinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12962"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Carolyn Coats<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anoohya Arkala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Londin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avinoam Nevler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan R.

Here, we evaluated, the effects of AZD1390 on radiation sensitivity and DNA damage repair pathways in glioblastoma (GBM) cells and patient derived xenografts (PDXs). AZD1390 (30 nM and higher) suppressed IR (5 Gy)-induced phosphorylation of ATM-Serine1981 and downstream phosphorylation sites on Kap1, Chk2 and H2AX in U251 cells and multiple PDXs. Consistent with enhanced DNA damage, AZD1390 increased IR induced G2\/M arrest in U251 (80.6% with AZD1390\/IR vs. 64.6% with IR, p= 0.01), GBM43 (61.9% vs. 25.7%, p= 0.01) and GBM39 (40.9% vs. 25.4%, p= 0.01). Moreover, in a clonogenic survival assay, AZD1390 sensitized U251 cells to 5 Gy IR (0.24% survival with AZD1390\/IR vs. 2.3% with IR alone, p=0.01). In a reporter-based analysis of DNA repair capacity, ATM inhibition resulted in a 40 to 60% reduction in homologous recombination (HR) and modest but significant decrease in micro-homology mediated end joining (MMEJ) and gap fill-in synthesis in U251 cells but had no effect on non-homologous end joining, translesion synthesis, nucleotide or base excision repair pathways. Comparing effects of AZD1390 on repair in GBM14 (TP53-wt) and GBM43 (TP53-mutant), similar results were observed except that decreased MMEJ was seen only in GBM43 (0.03&#177; 0.01% vs. 0.07&#177; 0.01% in control, p=0.002). Intriguingly, RAD51 knockdown (to disrupt HR) sensitized U251 and GBM43 but not GBM14. The efficacy of AZD1390 &#177; IR was studied in vivo in 10 PDXs. IR was delivered to orthotopic tumors using opposed lateral 225 kVp beams. AZD1390 (20 mg\/kg PO) was given just prior to each radiation dose (2 Gy x 5 fractions). AZD1390 monotherapy was mostly ineffective, IR alone was reasonably efficacious with an average 1.8 &#177; 0.1-fold-increase in survival relative to sham radiation (survival ratio) across all 10 models. IR\/AZD1390 treatment resulted in significant survival extension relative to IR alone in 6 of 10 models. Analysis of the survival benefit of combination therapy compared to IR alone across the entire cohort of PDXs was statistically marginal (average survival ratio 2.3&#177; 0.3 vs. 1.8 &#177; 0.1 with IR, p=0.08). However, when stratified by TP53 status, combination therapy was significantly more effective than IR (mean survival ratio 2.3 &#177; 0.1 vs. 1.6 &#177; 0.2 with IR alone, p=0.02) in TP53-mutant PDXs, where all 5 models benefited. In contrast, TP53-wt group had no benefit (mean survival ratio 2.2 &#177; 0.5 vs. 2.0 &#177; 0.2, p=0.61), GBM39 was only TP53-wt PDX that benefited from the combination. In conclusion, AZD1390 is an effective radio-sensitizer that causes disruption in HR and potentially other DNA repair pathways. Interestingly, in vivo radiosensitizing effects are mostly restricted to TP53-mutant GBM PDXs. Understandingmechanism of resistance in the context of different TP53 backgrounds remains an important future direction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b8cb7331-f63b-4bc9-a364-02585492927e\/@E03B8ZEN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Cancer therapy,Glioma,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12964"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shiv K.

Colchicine is representative of the class and is an effective disruptor of microtubule dynamics. Microtubules play an important role in the maintenance of vascular integrity, hence the ability of these agents to collapse tumour blood vessels, and consequently cause tumour necrosis. Colchicine, in addition to its vascular disrupting properties, is known to induce G2\/M arrest and trigger apoptosis. ICT2588 is a non-toxic, tumour targeted prodrug of a potent colchicine analogue with reduced potential for toxicity, (cardiotoxicity in particular) due to its metabolic stability in plasma and normal tissues. The preclinical evaluation of ICT2588 to-date has been focused solely on its selective tumour vascular disrupting ability and subsequent antitumour activity. The aim of this current study was to investigate the cellular metabolism of ICT2588, examine its G2\/M cell cycle arrest potential, and to explore mechanisms of synergy between ICT2588 and ATR inhibition.<br \/>Method: The cellular mechanism of uptake and MT1-MMP-selective metabolism of ICT2588 was studied in MT1-MMP positive (HT1080) and negative (MCF-7) cell lines using LCMS based metabolism assays. Flow cytometry was used to analyse the effect of ICT2588 and active azademethylcolchicine (the &#8216;warhead&#8217;) on G2\/M cell cycle arrest in both MT1-MMP positive and negative cell lines. The growth inhibitory effects of ICT2588 and its warhead either alone or in combination with ceralasertib (AZD6738, ATR inhibitor) were performed using an MTT assay in MT1-MMP positive cell lines (HT1080, MDA-MB-231, and SH-SY5Y). Synergy Finder (https:\/\/synergyfinder.fimm.fi) was used to evaluate combinations.<br \/>Results: The expression of MT1-MMP correlates with selective metabolism of ICT2588 and subsequent selective release of its warhead in HT1080 cells, but not MCF-7 cells. This metabolism is inhibited by an MT1-MMP inhibitor. Metabolism of ICT2588 induced G2\/M arrest and triggered apoptosis in HT1080 cells, but not in MCF-7 cells, though the warhead induced G2\/M arrest and triggered apoptosis in both cell lines. ICT2588 was synergistic with AZD6738 in all MT1-MMP positive cell lines, contrary to the antagonism observed with the warhead and AZD6738. These findings will be explored.<br \/>Conclusion: ICT2588 is metabolised by only MT1-MMP expressing cells, releasing the potent colchicine analogue in a targeted-manner, which synergised with ATR inhibition in a way not observed when the warhead was administered alone. This in vitro data has important potential implications for possible combinations of ICT2588 and DNA damage repair inhibitors in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/904666f9-9094-4a8b-b3bd-62b506221d83\/@E03B8ZEN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted drug delivery,DNA damage response,ATR inhibition,MMP Prodrug,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12965"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Francis M.

However, the associated severe side effects, especially damage to normal proliferating cells like stem and progenitor cells, often lead to drug dose reduction, which limits treatment success. Indeed, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is manifested by neutropenia, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Although growth factors ameliorate this myelosuppression, their efficacy is still suboptimal and lineage specific. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that AsiDNA, a double-stranded (DS) DNA molecule that mimics DS DNA breaks to interfere with DNA repair by over-activating a false DNA damage signaling through DNA-PK and PARP enzymes (decoy agonist), is extremely well tolerated in standalone in mammals. These observations led us to assess the potential of AsiDNA to protect healthy cells from toxicities of several anti-cancer treatments.<br \/>Experimental design:<b> <\/b>In vivo, we analyzed the safety profile of AsiDNA during a recent clinical trial (DRIIV-1b\/ NCT03579628) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. In vitro, we used isolated blood cells from healthy donors, and epithelial and fibroblast cells as models to study if AsiDNA could protect healthy cells to chemo- and radiotherapy-induced toxicity. We monitored cell survival, DNA damage (comet assays) and repair (53BP1 and Rad51 foci), DNA-PK (HSP90 and H2AX phosphorylation) and PARP (PARylation) activation, cell cycle modulation and p53 dependency to identify mechanisms underlying the effects of AsiDNA on healthy cells.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>In vivo, long-term treatment of several patients with carboplatine+\/-paclitaxel + AsiDNA showed no increase of chemotherapies toxicities allowing longer periods of disease control and suggesting a protective effect of AsiDNA. In the in vitro models, we showed that AsiDNA enters non dividing and dividing healthy cells as revealed by intracellular PARylation but induces its nuclear target engagement (H2AX and HSP90 phosphorylation) only in dividing cells. Association of AsiDNA to antitumor treatments increased survival of healthy proliferative cells. Interestingly, AsiDNA displayed two distinct mechanisms of protection depending on the origin of the cells: p53-dependent G1\/S cell cycle arrest in fibroblasts and epithelial cells, and DNA repair &#8220;doping&#8221; in hematological cells revealed by higher recruitment of Rad51 and 53BP1 at damage sites in those cells. Enzymatic inhibition and gene editing revealed that hyperactivation of DNA-PK\/p53 pathway by AsiDNA might be required for healthy cells preservation.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>These findings suggest that the combination of AsiDNA with anticancer treatments should provide a means to attenuate therapy-induced toxicity, while showing the well-documented synergy in tumor cells, thus providing an opportunity to increase the therapeutic window.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4a1c7eab-4957-4ba0-85c1-e058a6e3a14e\/@E03B8ZEN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair,Chemo-toxicity,AsiDNA,Hemato-preservation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12966"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wael Jdey<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anouk Sesink<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agathe Cohendet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliette Rieu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chloe Doizelet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Hayes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre-Marie Girard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Dutreix<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Greciet<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite high response rates to initial therapy, rapid development of therapeutic resistance limits overall survival. There are also limited treatment options, particularly in the relapsed setting. Our group and others have shown that AXL, a TAM family receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in mesenchymal tumors, mediates resistance to chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies in SCLC, non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers, through its roles in driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition and DNA damage repair. AXL has also been implicated in immune escape. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that AXL targeting may be a potential therapeutic approach in SCLC. We screened BGB324 (bemcentinib), a selective small-molecule AXL inhibitor in clinical trials for various advanced solid tumors, in a panel of 60 human SCLC cell lines using cell viability assays. The SCLC cell lines showed a range of sensitivities, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 41 nM to 10 &#181;M (median IC<sub>50<\/sub> 3.1 &#181;M) with <i>NeuroD1<\/i>-driven SCLC cell lines being highly sensitive to BGB324 (ANOVA p&#60;0.05). BGB324 also showed potent inhibition of tumor growth in an <i>in vivo <\/i>SCLC<i> <\/i>model. BGB324 further combined synergistically with an ATR inhibitor (AZD3738) and induces significant DNA damage. In a syngeneic model of SCLC, the combination of BGB324, AZD6738 and an anti-PDL1 antibody combination also induced significant tumor regression. Together, these promising findings show that AXL inhibition may be effective in SCLC and support further investigation of AXL and ATR inhibitor combinations with immune checkpoint blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e2dafdd-ac96-49eb-aa91-24417c6c4002\/@E03B8ZEN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Axl,ATR,Immune response,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12968"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kavya Ramkumar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Azusa Tanimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>C.

Here, we define the deubiquitinase USP1 as a synthetic lethal target in cancers with underlying DNA repair vulnerabilities. A highly potent and selective small molecule USP1 inhibitor conferred a viability defect in BRCA1-mutant, but not WT cell lines by activating replication stress. Genome-wide CRISPR screening uncovered RAD18 and UBE2K, which promote PCNA mono- and poly-ubiquitination respectively, as key mediators of USP1-BRCA1 dependency. Increased cellular mono- and poly-ubiquitination reduced PCNA protein levels, and restoration of PCNA protein expression rescued USP1 inhibitor sensitivity. USP1 dependency is associated with upregulated RAD18 and UBE2K expression, suggesting that elevated PCNA ubiquitination in the context of BRCA1 deficiency mediates USP1 synthetic lethality. Interestingly, USP1, but not PARP1 inhibition, elicited a viability defect in a subset of BRCA1\/2 WT lung cancer cell lines, indicative of novel synthetic lethal interactions unique to USP1. Moreover, dual inhibition of PARP1 and USP1 are strongly synergistic in PARP1 inhibitor-responsive cell line models. Strong <i>in vivo <\/i>anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor models was demonstrated with USP1 inhibition alone and in combination with the PARP1 inhibitor olaparib. Our studies suggest that USP1 and PARP1 inhibitors target BRCA1-mutant cancer though distinct yet synergistic mechanisms. As such, USP1 inhibitors may provide novel treatment strategies for PARP1 inhibitor-resistant and -na&#239;ve BRCA1-mutant cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ba0dcc4-e069-4061-ad73-7a87ae51e607\/@E03B8ZEN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,BRCA,DNA damage response,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12969"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Justin Engel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madhavi Bandi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antione Simoneau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Lazarides<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepali Gotur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Truc Pham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shangtao Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Meier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongxiang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Binzhang Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Douglas Whittington<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shanzhong Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuewen Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lina Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Throner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Maxwell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingnan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jannik Andersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Tianshu Feng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Inhibiting normal ATR function leads to increasing accumulation of double-strand breaks (DSB), particularly in genomically unstable tumor cells with preexisting replication stress, resulting in further genomic instability, mitotic catastrophe, and cell death. Targeting ATR is, therefore, a relevant strategy for the development of novel anticancer agents. This study tested the antitumor effects induced by ATG-018, a novel small molecule ATR inhibitor, in preclinical tumor models.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Firstly, the antiproliferative activity of ATG-018 was evaluated against a panel of 143 tumor cell lines. Cell proliferation was measured after 72 hours of exposure to ATG-018, using CellTiter-Glo Cell Viability Assay. An unbiased genomic analysis of the tested cell lines was used to discover potential predictive biomarkers. The activity of ATR-inhibition by ATG-018 was determined by measuring phospho-Ser345 CHK1 protein level in HT-29 cells, using pCHK1 AlphaScreen assay. A mobility shift-based ATR kinase reaction assay was used to assess the direct inhibition of ATR by ATG-018. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of ATG-018 was evaluated in LoVo (colorectal cancer), OE21 (esophageal cancer) and OCI-LY-19 (lymphoma) CDX mouse models, respectively.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Potent in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy has been observed for ATG-018. For cell proliferation inhibition, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ATG-018 ranged from 0.22&#956;M to 10&#956;M in 137 out of 143 cell lines, including both solid tumor and hematological malignancies, while ATG-018 did not affect the viability of normal PBMCs. A series of genetic alterations has been discovered to be correlated with the sensitivity to ATG-018, which could be potential predictive biomarkers. For ATR activity inhibition, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ATG-018 required for ATR downstream (CHK1) phosphorylation inhibition was 1.4nM in HT-29 cells and the IC<sub>50<\/sub> required for inhibiting ATR kinase reaction was 16nM. Dose-dependent antitumor efficacy was observed with ATG-018 in LoVo, OE21 and OCI-LY-19 CDX models. 10 mg\/kg ATG-018 showed a statistically significant antitumor activity in all the three CDX models. In the OCI-LY-19 CDX model, 10 mg\/kg ATG-018 showed 73.52 % TGI on day 14 after grouping (p value=0.0014), and 50mg\/kg ATG-018 induced tumor regression.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Single agent ATG-018 exhibited strong monotherapy efficacy in preclinical cancer models with certain homologous recombination deficiencies, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for such patient populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fb8d37e5-363e-4b2d-9f4c-8fbaf3fcedf1\/@E03B8ZEN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATR,Cancer,DNA damage response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12971"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hui Yuwen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ya Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lulu Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiamei Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bin Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Bing Hou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Shan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Mei<\/i><\/presenter>.

Inhibitors of BCL-2 have been shown to also induce apoptosis. ZN-d5 and ZN-c3, currently in clinical development for the treatment of cancer, are highly selective and potent inhibitors of Bcl-2 and Wee1, respectively. The combination of ZN-d5 with ZN-c3 induced robust tumor regressions in preclinical models and the mechanism of action of this activity is presented.<br \/>Methods: Cell proliferation in tumor cell lines was measured using CellTiter-Glo&#174; (Promega). Cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, phosphorylated CDK1 (p-CDK1), &#947;H2AX, Wee1, RRM2 and other markers were measured by Western blotting, IHC and\/or flow cytometry. Anti-tumor efficacy was determined in several xenograft models.<br \/>Results: The combination of ZN-c3 and ZN-d5 resulted in additive or synergistic anti-proliferative activity in several tumor cell lines. This enhancement of anti-proliferative activity was also observed at concentrations of ZN-d5 that induced caspase activation, but minimal apoptosis. Treatment of tumor cell lines with ZN-d5 alone at these sublethal concentrations caused induction of &#947;H2AX, a marker of double-stranded DNA breaks, and degradation of caspase-sensitive proteins relevant to the DNA Damage Response (DDR), such as RRM2 (a ribonucleotide reductase subunit) and Wee1. Degradation of Wee1 correlated with decreases in p-CDK1, a marker of Wee1 inhibition. These effects were mainly reversible and were inhibited by pre-treatment with caspase inhibitors. Mechanistically, the combination of ZN-c3 and ZN-d5 resulted in increased levels of &#947;H2AX, enhanced inhibition of p-CDK1, and increased levels of apoptotic markers compared to single agent treatment. Similar results were obtained when ZN-c3 was combined with inhibitors of other BCL-2 family proteins such as inhibitors of MCL-1 and BCL-xL. Finally, the combination of ZN-c3 with ZN-d5 or other BH3 mimetics showed synergistic anti-tumor activity in several xenograft models further supporting the rationale for combining these agents.<br \/>Conclusions: ZN-d5 or other BH3 mimetics caused caspase-mediated DNA damage and degraded relevant proteins such as Wee1 and RRM2 resulting in additive or synergistic anti-tumor activity when combined with ZN-c3. These results support a novel use of BH3 mimetics to activate caspase activity, independently of apoptosis induction, to significantly enhance the activity of DDR inhibitors such as ZN-c3","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41675cab-0676-47a3-b2e5-6f843d5a70f1\/@E03B8ZEN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"WEE1,Bcl-2 protein family,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12972"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hooman Izadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noah Ibrahim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiffany Hoang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianhui Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petrus R.

Wee1 regulates the G2\/M checkpoint and abrogating the G2 checkpoint by inhibiting Wee-1 in cancer cells with DNA damage can preferentially sensitize cancer cells to undergo mitotic catastrophe. We have developed and characterized ZN-c3, a potent and selective Wee-1 inhibitor with a differentiated kinase selectivity and pharmacokinetics profile.<br \/>ZN-c3 was evaluated in ER-positive, triple negative, triple negative PARP inhibitor resistant, and Her-2 positive trastuzumab resistant breast cancers. In the ER-positive MCF-7 efficacy model, ZN-c3 demonstrated anti-tumor activity as a single agent as well as in combinations with a CDK4\/6 inhibitor (Palbociclib) or ZN-c5, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). In the MDA-MB-436, a triple negative breast cancer tumor xenograft<br \/>model, ZN-c3 demonstrated efficacy as a single agent and in combination with the PARP inhibitors Olaparib or Niraparib. We extended these combination studies by evaluating the efficacy of Niraparib in combination with ZN-c3 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) triple negative breast tumors. ZN-c3 was efficacious as a single agent and the efficacy was enhanced in the combination with Niraparib.<br \/>PARP inhibitors are effective and have been approved for treatment of some cancer types. However, most patients develop resistance to these agents. We sought to investigate whether ZN-c3 can overcome the acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors (Olaparib and Niraparib). We generated PARP inhibitor resistant breast tumor xenograft models. A significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in these resistant tumor xenograft models when treated with ZN-c3. These data suggest that ZN-c3 as a single agent can overcome the acquired PARP inhibitor resistance. Finally, we also evaluated ZN-c3 activity in a HER-2 positive trastuzumab resistant breast tumor xenograft model (JIMT-1) and ZN-c3 showed anti-tumor activity alone and in combination with trastuzumab. In summary, these results demonstrate that ZN-c3 is effective as a single agent and in combination with other targeted therapies in breast cancer models. Moreover, ZN-c3 can overcome the acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors and trastuzumab. ZN-c3 is currently in clinical trials for several indications and has demonstrated promising clinical activity and good tolerability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c67afc9-234c-44dd-951a-29287f033f4d\/@E03B8ZEN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"WEE1,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12973"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jiali Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianhui Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petrus R.

Inhibition of HDAC3 results in the suppression of genes responsible for DNA damage repair and maintenance of genomic stability. HDAC3\/NCOR1 also play critical roles in tumor metabolism and immune cell biology. GB-3103 is a novel and potent inhibitor of HDAC3 with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.56nM that was tested for activity against human neuroendocrine prostate (NEPC) and small cell lung cancers (SCLC). RNA-seq analysis of GB-3103 treated human tumor cells revealed induction of BRCAness, inhibition of genes from DNA repair pathways and inhibition of PI3K-AKT1, MYC and p53 signaling. GB-3103 showed potent in vitro anticancer activity against the human H660 NEPC line, with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 28nM, and 21nM against the murine PNEC30 line and potent IC<sub>50 <\/sub>of 16nM against NCI-H209 human lung neuroendocrine cancer. Because of the potent induction of BRCAness we used zero interaction potency (ZIP) model to test the activity of the combination of GB-3103 with a PARP inhibitor against human H660 and murine PNEC30 cell lines. These experiments revealed synergy for the combination of PARPi with GB-3103 in NEPC. GB-3103 was subsequently tested alone and in combination with olaparib in a xenograft model of H660. GB3103 (TGI=3%) showed minimal activity at the selected dose against H660 compared to single agent olaparib (TGI=67%). However, when combined with olaparib, GB-3103 revealed potent synergy (TGI=96%, p&#60;0.01). In the NCI-H209 human lung neuroendocrine xenograft model, GB-3103 showed robust activity as a single agent (TGI=83%) compared to single agent olaparib (TGI=33%) and single agent talazoparib (TGI=69%). When combined with olaparib, GB-3103 induced synergistic antitumor effect (TGI=99%, p&#60;t0.001) when compared to olaparib treatment alone. When combined with talazoparib, GB-3103 induced synergistic antitumor effect (TGI &#62;100%, p&#60;0.001) when compared to talazoparib treatment alone. Taken together, these data confirm the important role of HDAC3 in neuroendocrine prostate and small cell lung cancers and suggest HDAC3 inhibition by GB-3103 could be an effective approach for patients with neuroendocrine cancers particularly when combined with inhibitors of PARP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ef610c4-ae06-46e3-943f-83200befa82e\/@F03B8ZEP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-04 Modulation of DNA repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Epigenetics,DNA repair inhibition,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12974"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Stephanie Nagl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kendra Devore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregg Hirschfeld<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kari Kotlarczyk<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Damaris Diaz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maggie Murray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Gonzales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Thomas Gately<\/i><\/presenter>.

The resistance develops through various mechanisms, including BRCA1\/2 reversion mutation. Several publications have suggested that CHK2 inhibition could help overcome the resistance to PARP inhibitors. We discovered a novel small molecule CHK2 inhibitor, ART-122, and conducted a series of experiments to explore the rationale for combining a PARP inhibitor and ART-122 to treat the BRCA wild-type ovarian and breast tumors.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the LanthaScreen<sup>TM<\/sup> Kinase assay, ART-122 was shown to have the IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.57 nM and 10.85 nM, for CHK2 and CHK1, respectively. We observed the strong synergy between ART-122 and olaparib in the mouse xenograft model using the MDA-MB-231 cancer cells (BRCA1\/2 wild type, triple-negative breast cancer cells). Animals were treated with 50 mg\/kg olaparib on days 1-5, 30 mg\/kg ART-122 on days 1-2 each week for 3 weeks, or both therapies. The result demonstrated approximately 41% reduction in tumor volume in mice treated with the combination therapy compared to the vehicle group. Animals treated with either of the single-agent therapies showed tumor growth similar to the vehicle group. We did not observe apparent toxicity or significant body weight differences among the animals. Additionally, the synergism between ART-122 and olaparib was confirmed in other cancer cell lines, including several BRCA wild-type and BRCA mutant cells lines such as CaOV3, SK-OV-3, UWB1.289, UWB1.289 with BRCA overexpression, HCC1937, MDA-MB-436, and MCF7.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The combination of ART-122 and Olaparib demonstrated a synergistic effect in BRCA wild-type ovarian and breast tumor cell lines. In the mouse xenograft model, the CHK2 inhibitor ART-122 sensitized BRCA1\/2 wild-type tumor cells MDA-MB-231 to olaparib treatment.

PARP inhibition blocks base excision repair and results in conversion of SSBs to DNA double-strand break (DSBs). DSBs are the most deleterious form of DNA damage that can be generated by exogenous DNA damaging agents or endogenous replication stress. DSBs can be repaired by homologous recombination repair (HRR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The physiological importance of HRR is underscored by the observation of genomic instability in HRR-deficient (HRD<sup>+<\/sup>) cells and, importantly, the association of cancer predisposition and developmental defects with mutations in HRR genes. PARP1 and PARP2 are required for SSB repair, while PARP1 is also involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication fork damage. Recent reports suggest the PARP1 inhibition is sufficient to elicit an anti-proliferative effect and that PARP2 is essential for the survival of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in animal models.AZD9574 is a novel brain penetrant PARP1 inhibitor that acts by selectively inhibiting and trapping PARP1 at the sites of SSBs. AZD9574 exhibited &#62;8000-fold selectivity for PARP1 compared to PARP2 and other members of the PARP family (PARP2, PARP3, PARP5a and PARP6) in biochemical assays. While AZD9574 inhibited PARP1 enzymatic activity in all tested cell lines irrespective of the HRR status (IC<sub>50<\/sub> range between 0.3 - 2 nM), colony formation assay in isogenic cell lines pairs confirmed higher potency and selectivity towards HRD<sup>+<\/sup> models (DLD1 BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>; SKOV-3 BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> and SKOV-3 PALB2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>). For example, AZD9574 IC<sub>50 <\/sub>in the BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> DLD1 cells was 1.38 nM compared to IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 40 &#181;M BRCA2<sup>wt<\/sup> cells, which corresponds to a ~20,000-fold greater efficacy in the BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>cells (ratio of AZD9574 IC<sub>50<\/sub> in BRCA2<sup>wt<\/sup> divided by BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) compared to the wild type parental line. <i>In vivo<\/i>, AZD9574 demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in a BRCA1 mutant MDA-MB-436 subcutaneous xenograft model. Anti-tumour effects of AZD9574 were manifested by pronounced growth regressions that were durable after treatment withdrawal. An intracranial xenograft model of breast cancer brain metastases was developed to assess the efficacy of AZD9574 in the context of blood-brain barrier penetrance. Treatment of animals with established intracranial lesions using a dose of 3 mg\/kg AZD9574 showed sustained tumour growth suppression resulting in a significantly extended survival of tumour-bearing mice. Collectively, we believe that our data support the development of AZD9574 as a potential therapy for patients with HRD<sup>+ <\/sup>breast cancer whose disease has spread to the brain.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/61678a75-32de-4bb4-aa98-96ad9b6a27d9\/@F03B8ZEP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Base excision repair,Brain metastasis,Homologous recombination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20873"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kunzah Jamal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Staniszewska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Gordon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shenghua Wen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank McGrath<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Dowdell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominic Kabbabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuditta Illuzzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Griffin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Barry R.
