[{"Abstract":"Transcriptomic analysis has substantially advanced our understanding of human diseases, but the complex nature of tissues is often ignored. Recent development of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies has made it possible to characterize cellular heterogeneity of solid tissues. Along with analyzing gene expression patterns on a single-cell level, there is a critical need to explore the spatial patterns exhibited by the genes across the tissue sample. Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) is key to understanding cellular functions in their morphological state. However, current barcoding-based SRT technologies, such as 10x Genomics Visium, lack single-cell resolution, greatly hindering the investigation of the spatial differences in gene expression profiles as failure to account for cell-type variations can lead to an obscured understanding of the spatial patterns detected across the tissue. The overall goal of this research is to integrate spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data in order to infer the gene expression profiles for each of the bulk-level spots in the spatially resolved data. This will allow us to study spatial patterns of genes with cell-type level resolution. SPACER expands the spatial transcriptomics data into the individual cell types by utilizing the spatial similarities and high-resolution histology information as a weight in a non-negative least squares regression. Having this integrated understanding allows us to gain an additional level of information about the gene activity for each cell type present in the tissue. We have performed benchmark evaluations for our method based on data generated from the 10x Visium platform and have seen promising results. The evaluations have shown high correlations for the gene expression patterns predicted by SPACER for varying cell types on the benchmark evaluations. We next analyzed spatial transcriptomics data for pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma tissue samples to better study the complex nature of cancerous tissues. A tumor is consistently interacting with its microenvironment, which can impact tumor growth and cell proliferation. Thus, it is important to study the spatial gene expression patterns for different cell types in cancerous tissues. During our analysis, we identify the boundary of the tumor region in the bulk-spatial transcriptomics data and perform differential expression analysis on the SPACER results to compare the expression patterns of the core tumor region to the infiltrated tumor regions for each individual cell type. Identifying genes that are differentially expressed for specific cell types in varying regions of the cancerous tissue can link gene expressions to clinically important morphological features, provide critical information about how cells are interacting with neighboring cells in their macroenvironment, and be used to target different tumor cells therapeutically.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 Statistical methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Spatial transcriptomics ,Tumor tissue histology,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15819"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amelia R.

However, the expression data captured by SEP technologies suffer from high noise levels, including but not limited to dropouts as in regular single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). The extra experimental steps for preserving the spatial locations of sequencing could result in even more severe noises, compared to regular scRNA-seq. Fortunately, such noises could be largely reduced by leveraging information from the physical locations of sequencing and the tissue and cellular organization reflected by corresponding pathology images. In this work, we demonstrated the extensive levels of noise in SEP data. We developed a mathematical model, named Sprod, to reduce such noises based on latent space and graph learning of matched location and imaging data. We comprehensively validated Sprod and demonstrated its advantages over prior methods for removing dropouts in scRNA-seq data. We further showed that, after adequately de-noising by Sprod, differential expression analyses, pseudotime analyses, and cell-to-cell interaction inferences yield significantly more informative results in various biological application settings. In particular, with Sprod, we discovered 3-4 times more RNA transcripts that were actively transported in mouse hippocampus neurons. We also showed that the tumor cells at the tumor-stroma boundaries demonstrate differential transcriptomic features from the tumor cells in the central regions, caused by their interactions with the stroma\/immune cells. Overall, we envision denoising by Sprod to become a key first step to empower SEP technologies for biomedical discoveries and innovations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression,Spatial transcriptomics,Noise removal,Dropouts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15826"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yunguan Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bing Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shidan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengyi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guanghua Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite the rapid development in these technologies, there is a significant bottleneck for the analysis of the resulting large-scale datasets. Here we present CopyKit, a comprehensive and user-friendly toolkit for the analysis of single cell copy number data. CopyKit provides a suite of tools for pre-processing, QC, copy number inference, and subclone clustering to delineate the clonal diversity of tumors. We performed single cell copy number sequencing of 2977 cells from two breast tumor liver metastasis. CopyKit identified 4 and 12 subclonal populations, including amplification of PDGFRA, KRAS, and MYC as well as losses of PTEN, FOXO1, RB1, and BRCA1, many of which were spatially segregated in the tumor mass of the two tumors. Additionally, we applied CopyKit to study metastatic dissemination from a primary ER+ breast tumor with two matched metastatic sites and two colorectal carcinomas with matched liver metastatic tissues. This analysis demonstrated that the breast metastatic tumors selected for subclones that were lacking ERBB2 amplification in the primary site. Furthermore, the liver metastasis had deletions of chromosomes 18, 19, and 20p and a focal gain of FGFR1, while the pleural effusion acquired two additional focal gains on chromosome 8, including MYC. The colorectal metastatic tumors diverged from the primary tumor with copy number events affecting important cancer genes such as gain of SOX4, MYC, CDK8 and deletions of FHIT, CHEK1, and CHEK2. Collectively, this study shows that CopyKit provides a comprehensive set of tools for resolving clonal substructure from single cell copy number data for diverse applications in cancer biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b7a6f06-9a36-4aa6-b90c-c7ab38fdf3bd\/@v03B8ZA9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Copy number alterations,Breast cancer,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15830"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Darlan Conterno Minussi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junke Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aislyn Schalck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua-Jun Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emi Sei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Edgerton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandro Contreras<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Hui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Senthil Damodaran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Kopetz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bora Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Navin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Solid tumors often present a dynamic, heterogeneous environment consisting of both cancer (sub)clones and normal cells. Bulk expression data represent population averages and its interpretation is confounded by both normal cell contamination and somatic copy number alterations. Several computational methods to deconvolve tumour and normal expression profiles from bulk RNA-seq have been developed recently. However, these methods often rely on a set of cell-type-specific reference signatures and ignore the effect of copy number changes.<b><br \/>Methods: <\/b>To address these issues, we have developed a method that formalizes the relationship between allele-specific copy number, expression and sample purity to deconvolve the expression profiles of tumor and normal cells from bulk RNA-seq data in an unbiased manner. Our method was applied to sequencing data produced by the TRACERx consortium, a longitudinal study with multi-region whole-exome and RNA-seq of non-small-cell lung cancers. A total of 414 primary tumor regions and 140 adjacent normal tissue samples from 140 TRACERx patients with matched DNA and RNA sequencing data were processed.<b><br \/>Results: <\/b>Here, we were able to directly deconvolve a median of ~2,000 genes per sample and indirectly infer tumor and normal expression profiles of ~10,000 genes. The accuracy of the deconvolution was validated using <i>in-silico<\/i> mixtures of patient-derived tumour and normal cells and in regions with loss of heterogeneity (LOH) directly on the bulk sequencing data, where the total fraction of expression attributed to tumor cells can be computed directly using somatic mutations. Our method revealed a strong and constitutive genome-wide overexpression in cancer cells compared to admixed normal cells, this overexpression was more pronounced in lung squamous cell carcinoma than lung adenocarcinoma (p&#38;lt0.001). Multidimensional projection of the purified tumor and normal expression profiles together with the adjacent normal tissue showed clear separation between the purified expression profiles and notably, the deconvolved normal expression was more similar to the normal adjacent profiles than the purified tumor profiles.<b><br \/>Conclusion: <\/b>Overall, these results suggest that our method is able to accurately disentangle the expression of tumour and normal cells from bulk RNA-seq without any previous knowledge. It has potential applications in many studies that include matched RNA-seq and copy number data and can provide new insights functional characterization, the taxonomy of cancer, and tumor evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/325c3ec9-554f-4f73-adc9-df2c322bc493\/@v03B8ZA9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing,Copy number,Lung cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15832"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carla Castignani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Demeulemeester<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Larose Cadieux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert E.

Previous gene expression and DNA methylation deconvolution approaches for tumor micro-environment have had some success for major cell types. However, existing methods lack specificity to tumor type and detailed cell types. We developed 21 tumor-specific DNA methylation-based libraries. We employed a novel hierarchical approach in 3 major tumor microenvironment components (tumor, angiogenic, immune) to profile 17 cell types (see methods below).<br \/>Methods: DNA methylation data on tumor samples (n=6183) and normal control samples (n=689) for 21 tumor sites were downloaded from GEO and TCGA to develop tumor-type-specific libraries. The top 1000 most informative differentially methylated CpG (DMC) sites were identified using <i>InfiniumPurify <\/i>for 21 tumor types to project tumor cell proportion. Epithelial, endothelial, and stromal cell samples were used to identify DMCs to profile the cells in the angiogenic environment. Basophil, eosinophil, neutrophil, dendritic cell, monocyte, B na&#239;ve, B memory, CD4T na&#239;ve, CD4T memory, CD8T na&#239;ve, CD8T memory, T regulatory, and natural killer cells were used to identify DMCs to deconvolve the immune environment. In conjunction with the constrained projection\/quadratic programming approach, a novel hierarchical approach was employed with six layers and 12 libraries per tumor type to project cell proportions in first, tumor, second, angiogenic, and third, immune micro-environments. The method was validated using purified samples and experimental artificial mixtures.<br \/>Results: 12 libraries were developed per tumor site to deconvolve 17 cell types in 21 tumors. A preliminary application of the method on TCGA data investigating the association between angiogenic cells and survival revealed worse survival outcomes with a higher proportion of angiogenic cell proportions in BLCA (p&#60;0.01) and HNSC (p=0.02), a higher endothelial cell proportion in CESC (p=0.04), a higher epithelial cell proportion in COAD (p=0.02), a lower endothelial proportion in KIRC (p&#60;0.01), and a lower epithelial proportion in LUAD (p=0.04). Further analyses will be done to investigate the angiogenic and immune microenvironments with prognosis across tumor sites.<br \/>Conclusion: We developed a DNA methylation-based algorithm, ExTIME, to estimate cell proportions in the tumor microenvironments. This novel approach increased the specificity and accuracy of cell projection by employing a tumor-site-specific hierarchical model. Furthermore, the ExTIME profiles the tumor microenvironment to the most granular level compared to the existing methods. ExTIME&#8217;s capability of depicting the cellular composition in tumors promises a better understanding of the cell heterogeneity and its relationship with prognosis across cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1c7e0793-8a03-44bb-a771-b640e3d4ea3c\/@v03B8ZA9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15833"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ze Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brock C.

An important mechanism of resistance to adoptive cell therapy targeting tumor-specific neoantigens is the genetic loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles or alterations in HLA expression in tumor cells. Therapies targeting neoantigens presented by HLA alleles that have either been deleted, mutated or are strongly downregulated are likely to lack efficacy due to the absence or reduction of epitope presentation. Surveying neoepitope presentation escape mechanisms is key for personalized immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: PACT Pharma has developed PACT-ESCAPE, a method that integrates DNA and RNA sequencing data to quantify allelic imbalance at HLA loci, including the most extreme case of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Allelic imbalance is first determined at the DNA level by determining the patient&#8217;s maternal and paternal haplotypes across chromosome 6p to infer their copy number states. Twenty-six HLA Class I and II loci from chromosome 6 are then genotyped at high resolution, enabling accurate assignment of copy number states to the patient&#8217;s alleles, including any alleles that have been deleted in the tumor. Unlike other currently available methods, PACT-ESCAPE also measures the relative RNA expression of HLA alleles to provide an orthogonal estimate of allelic imbalance across chromosome 6 and support loss of heterozygosity calls made at the DNA level. Presentation machinery genes are also surveyed for loss of function mutations. To benchmark PACT-ESCAPE, we compared loss of heterozygosity calls at HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C between our method and a previously published DNA-based HLA LOH classifier for 17 samples for which we had matched tumor\/normal whole exome sequencing.<br \/>Results: We found 100% concordance between PACT-ESCAPE and the benchmark, with four samples showing LOH at HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C at the DNA level. Next, we evaluated RNA sequencing from tumor samples and confirmed that the relative expression of the lost allele compared to the kept allele was lower when LOH was called. High levels of allelic imbalance in gene expression, however, were not unique to samples with LOH, suggesting that differential expression of HLA alleles might also be an important contributor to immune escape in cancer.<br \/>Conclusions: Evaluation of allelic imbalance in DNA copy number and RNA expression in PACT-ESCAPE provides new insights into immune escape in cancer. Adoptive cell therapy targeting neoantigens will benefit by enabling the accurate selection of targets most likely to be presented by the tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f3f8586-f9e1-4f27-a1b4-ed3c1bb1eba0\/@v03B8ZA9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Loss of heterozygosity,Human Leukocyte Antigen,Immune escape,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15834"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chad C.

Personalized immunotherapies, such as cancer vaccines, rely on neoantigen prediction to identify sequences that can activate T cells to recognize and destroy the tumor. The majority of cancer vaccine trials have utilized neoantigens derived from missense mutations and small insertions and deletions. However, other mutation types could contribute to the overall neoantigen landscape, such as aberrantly spliced transcripts arising from <i>cis<\/i>-acting regulatory mutations. In this study, we explore the potential immunogenicity of alternative splicing events by creating pVACsplice, a tool to expand the capability of pVACtools, a suite of tools for neoantigen prediction (http:\/\/www.pvactools.org). pVACsplice assembles alternative transcripts from tumor-specific splicing patterns, identifies sequence changes by comparison to a reference, and predicts neoantigens from the novel regions. To verify the accuracy of alternative transcript assembly, we ran pVACsplice with HCC1395 cell line samples and performed long-read sequencing to detect the transcripts <i>in vitro<\/i>. Matched whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing datasets from glioblastoma, melanoma, and colorectal cancer cohorts will also be analyzed with pVACsplice to obtain binding affinity estimates. We will compare these results to neoantigen predictions from other mutation sources and across cancer types to discover the prevalence of immunogenic splicing events. Finally, we will perform immunogenicity testing with a set of high quality candidates to validate our predictions. We hope to increase the number of candidates for patients&#8217; vaccines by adding this functionality to our standard neoantigen prediction workflow. This tool could help generate a more accurate portrait of the neoantigen landscape in tumors, and in turn, enhance responses to personalized immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6e7248a-0381-469a-9efc-03aee21063d3\/@v03B8ZA9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Neoantigens,Personalized medicine,Alternative splicing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15839"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Megan M.

Despite the cross-platform correlation of gene expression values, ideally, each measurement should be evaluated against a cohort of samples sequenced using the same methodology. Clinical samples, preserved as FFPEs, often undergo exome capture-based RNA-seq; research samples, stored as fresh\/frozen (FF), undergo poly-A RNA-seq, producing high quality expression data. Thus, development of sequencing protocols and data processing algorithms are necessary to provide the same quality gene expression measurements from FFPE samples. Further, while several batch effect correction algorithms exist to neutralize the batch effect between samples across large cohorts, the majority cannot be applied to an individual sample, raising the need to develop an algorithm for single sample projection to improve gene expression-based personalized clinical decision-making. To improve the quality of RNA reads from FFPE tissues, exome capture enrichment of RNA transcripts was optimized and the concordance with poly-A RNA-seq was increased by adding non coding 3&#8217; and 5&#8217; UTR region to the probes. After testing the performance of multiple different extraction methods, a 0.88 correlation was achieved between exome-capture-based and poly-A RNA-seq protocols. To further align the sequencing methodologies, we designed a batch-correction ML-based algorithm by performing a series of paired RNA-seq experiments from the same sample using exome-capture-based and poly-A RNA-seq; we applied linear modeling on the training subset (N = 64) and verified the performance on the validation subset (N = 24). For each gene, 5-20 correlated genes belonging to the TCGA combined pan-cancer datasets were selected and trained using the Lasso model. Over 82% of genes (total N = 20,062) correlated across the two RNA-seq methodologies for each sample after correction (ccc value &#62; 0.5), and approximately 94% of cancer-specific and microenvironment-related genes correlated (ccc value &#62; 0.5). The algorithm significantly outperformed other batch correction methods, with ccc values &#62; 0.8 for 51.37% of the 20,062 genes compared with ~3% for PCA, 26% for MNN, and 28% for ComBat. Our algorithm showed improved performance by correction of 77% of the 1,890 clinically-relevant genes (ccc values &#62; 0.8) compared with 15% for PCA, 39% for MNN, and 40% for ComBat. Here, we developed combinatory technology with a batch correction algorithm trained and developed on FFPE or FF tumor samples, using exome capture-based sequencing or poly-A RNA-seq, that enables the projection of a single sample onto a larger cohort. Future application of this correction tool will enable direct analysis of gene expression of single tumor samples to support potential gene expression-based treatment decisions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/19c49735-53fb-4085-9e8d-5084045b9ab0\/@v03B8ZA9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Bioinformatics,Gene expression profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15840"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"e30dc9bc-4e0e-4421-a70a-4c65df0f8c90","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e30dc9bc-4e0e-4421-a70a-4c65df0f8c90\/@v03B8ZA9\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nikita Kotlov<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirill Shaposhnikov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cagdas Tazearslan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilya Cheremushkin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madison Chasse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Artur Baisangurov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svetlana Podsvirova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svetlana Korkova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yaroslav Lozinsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katerina Nuzhdina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Vasileva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitry Kravchenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krystle Nomie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Curran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Fowler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Bagaev<\/i><\/presenter>.

SimBioSys has developed TumorScope, a platform capable of capturing the chemical and biophysical interactions within the tumor and with the surrounding tissue by integrating these factors into a virtual tumor model. TumorScope makes individualized predictions of the response of each patient&#8217;s tumor to NACT. It utilizes three-dimensional biophysical simulations that model the dynamic tumor microenvironment (TME). The platform allows modelling of nutrient transport and drug behavior through perfusion and predicts when and where different regions of the tumor grow and die, and how that translates to overall response to treatment. TumorScope also incorporates multi-omics data, imaging data, pathology, and patient characteristics to simulate tumor biology of individual patient tumors. We have validated our approach in breast cancer by comparing TumorScope simulations against actual tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in over 400 patients. Simulations were initialized using each patient&#8217;s pretreatment MRI and pathology data and run from the beginning of therapy to the specified surgical date. The simulated tumor volumetric percent response (calculated as the ratio of change in tumor volume to initial volume) at the time of surgery was then compared with actual tumor volumetric percent response extracted from presurgical MRIs. Moreover, using TumorScope as a decision support system, we predicted patient response to multiple chemotherapies. For patients with event free survival data available we performed a Cox proportional hazard analysis. Using SimBioSys TumorScope we predicted a pre-surgical tumor volumetric response with a median error of 0.03% and median absolute deviation of 8.2%. For patients with available EFS data, we found a significant difference associated with having a final simulated volume greater than 0.01 cc. The SimBioSys TumorScope accurately predicts patient specific responses to NACT using only standard-of-care pre-treatment diagnostic data. These predictions can support decision making and enable the selection of less-toxic regimens for patients in which a robust response is predicted, and more aggressive treatments or alternative treatment strategies when response is likely to be poor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/986a85de-5326-488a-b824-f6620db64c72\/@v03B8ZA9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Breast cancer,Modeling,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15841"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John A.

Meanwhile, the corresponding histopathology images of tissue sections are readily available and can be aligned to the measured spots. Given that the histology images are practically more convenient and affordable to obtain, we designed HOPE2Net, a multi-layer perceptron architecture, that leverages information provided by SRT data to predict gene expression and pathway activities from histology images. Through systematic evaluations of different approaches for extracting deep image features and cellular morphology features, HOPE2Net performs feature selections from a pre-trained Vision Transformer, which is the state-of-art deep learning model for image recognition. After extracting histological image features, HOPE2Net further integrates with position embeddings, to optimize the gene expression and pathway activity prediction tasks. Through analyzing breast cancer and prostate cancer SRT datasets obtained from numerous tissue sections in multiple patients, we demonstrate that HOPE2Net can accurately predict the gene expression patterns for highly variable genes and the activities for significantly enriched domain-specific pathways. We further show that the predicted gene expression and pathway activities can help detect cancer subtypes and aid in treatment decision-makings. Given the growing interest in applying SRT in cancer genomics, we believe HOPE2Net holds the potential in identifying biomarkers from direct screenings of tissue histology images, which may be implemented in clinical studies for cancer diagnoses and decision-making processes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Histology image,Deep learning,Gene expressions and pathway activities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15842"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kenong Su<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minxing Pang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingyao Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

Splicing and polyadenylation (PA) are well-known examples of PTR that can regulate not only gene expression but also their function. Alternative Polyadenylation (APA) has already been shown to be essential to many biological processes (e.g., proliferation, cell differentiation, etc) and has also been implicated in the development and progression of multiple diseases (e.g., cancer, hematological and immune disorders, etc.). Although several sequencing methods have been developed to sequence only the transcript termination site (TTS), the number of publicly available data derived from these methods is extremely limited in comparison to traditional RNA-Seq data. To overcome this limitation, we created a new framework - Compositional Regression of Polyadenylation Differences (CORE-PAD) - for the study of differential APA events using traditional bulk RNA-seq data. Through simulated data, we showed that CORE-PAD has higher accuracy than other methods (accuracy = 0.98) in detecting APA events. We applied CORE-PAD across prostate cancer (PCa) samples with impaired CDK12 and &#8220;wild&#8221; samples. We found multiple genes presented differential PA site usage, including DNA repair genes. Most notably, we notice that many genes that exhibit differential APA were not differentially expressed at gene level, meaning they are potentially &#8220;silent drivers&#8221; that cannot be capture through standard differential gene expression analysis. These findings highlight the importance of studying APA, which can help shed light into another layer of regulation occurring between transcription and translation. This is especially important since these events can be source of neoantigens or targeted mRNA degradation which could be explore for new treatments. Finally, the CORE-PAD framework was designed to take advantage of our recently published recount3 resource making over 750,000 RNA-Seq samples of human and mouse origin readily available for analysis, enabling studies of APA across thousands of phenotypes in an accurate and accessible way.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5638342e-f26a-47bc-aa89-6ef6a616dd18\/@v03B8ZA9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Post-transcriptional regulation,Alternative Polyadenylation,DNA Repair,CDK12,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15844"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eddie L.

Multiple studies have shown that HLA-I heterozygosity and high sequence divergence across alleles positively correlates with response to ICIs. However the high degree of polymorphism and allele sequence similarities in HLA and KIR present a challenge to accurate allele calling. To address these difficulties we developed kmerizer, a novel allele caller optimized for short fragments, such as reads from a cfDNA assay.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We tested kmerizer on MHC class1 and class2 genes, and on KIR genes, on both simulated datasets and real samples (cell lines and plasma samples). To assess the capability of the algorithm to distinguish highly homologous allele pairs, we simulated cfDNA-like fragments with errors on randomly selected allele pairs, and on allele pairs with a high level of homology. Twelve plasma samples and 19 reference cell lines fragmented to cfDNA size were analyzed using a NGS cfDNA assay. For plasma samples, paired buffy coats were sent to an external vendor for HLA typing using multiplex PCR-based amplicon and sequenced by 300bp paired-end reads.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Of the 19 cell lines and 12 plasma samples for HLA typing (A, B, C, and DQB1 loci), kmerizer delivered 100% sensitivity with 98% specificity. On the simulated dataset, kmerizer achieved 99% sensitivity and specificity on all the MHC class1 and class 2 loci, and 90% sensitivity and specificity on all KIR loci, for both homozygous and heterozygous pairs. The novel allele caller kmerizer also demonstrated a lighter footprint on computational resource need: one deep-sequencing plasma sample on average can be processed in less than 2 minutes which is about 15 times faster than the most commonly used HLA typing tool HISAT2<sup>1<\/sup>, which does not support KIR typing.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: As utilization of ICIs increases, the use of genetic and genomic information to accurately identify patients more likely to respond to ICIs will be critical. kmerizer is a fast and highly sensitive and specific allele caller, and it can effectively call alleles on both HLA and KIR.<br \/><b>References<\/b>: [1] Kim, D., Paggi, J.

However, precise annotation of cell type remains a challenge, hindering the efficiency of data interpretation. Several existing tools for cell-type annotation have been developed to improve resolution and reproducibility, yet their performance is reduced when the reference dataset contains many cell types, subclasses of similar cell types, or malignant cells. Interpatient malignant cell heterogeneity often leads to reduced accuracy when classifying cancer cells as most methods rely on correlations to a reference from a different source. Given the challenges in the annotation of scRNA-seq data of cancer and its high impact for elucidating mechanisms associated with tumor heterogeneity, pathogenesis, and treatment, we developed a comprehensive, hierarchically organized, multi-layered classifier spanning diverse malignant and normal cells of the tumor microenvironment. We found that performance improves when each layer focuses on a smaller number of classes and each cell sequentially moves down a series of classifiers with increased cell type resolution. When applied to an external validation dataset of over 300 primary solid tumor biopsies spanning diverse cancer types, the classifier accurately annotated the tissue of origin of malignant cells, and relevant subtypes of stromal and blood cells, with average F1 scores of 0.91, 0.95 and 0.99 respectively. Using confidence thresholds at each layer, the classifier abstains from classifying ambiguous cells. We applied 4 existing annotators provided with the same reference to the external test dataset and found that cancer cells are misclassified or unclassified, while the blood and stromal cells are accurately classified, highlighting our tool&#8217;s unique ability to classify cancer cells. Moreover, we applied our classifier&#8217;s to scRNA-seq data derived from breast cancer metastasis to the liver and were able to uncover the tissue of origin, demonstrating the potential use for determining the source of a metastatic tumour. Finally, given that our classifier is modular, we leveraged two recently published single cell breast cancer atlases to add a breast cancer subtype classification layer, that consistently identified the correct clinical subtype of single breast cancer cells in external data. This study provides a flexible model for the annotation of cells comprising the tumor microenvironment in pan cancer settings, while existing methods require tissue-specific references for every cancer type. Our classifier provides a powerful method for investigating intercellular communication pathways between tumor cells and non-malignant cells of the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/28c6c47c-07ec-46f4-b677-66fc5a1ea26c\/@w03B8ZAa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Pan Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15846"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ido Nofech-Mozes<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Awadalla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sagi Abelson<\/i><\/presenter>.

A fundamental assumption in supervised machine learning is that the data to be classified is derived from the same distribution as the data used to train the classifier. However, challenges in data acquisition often mean few or no labeled examples are available for the distribution of interest. For instance, sample sizes may be insufficient to train on rare cancer types, and technological limitations can hinder label generation, for instance a lack of simultaneous profiling of gene expression and mutation information in single-cell data. For such situations where labeled target data is limited, the field of domain adaptation and transfer learning has established principled ways to develop predictors for the data of interest (target data) using labeled data from a similar but distinct distribution (source data). One recent method, weighted elastic net domain adaptation (wenda), leverages the complex interactions between features (such as genes) to optimize a model&#8217;s predictive power on both source and target datasets. It learns the dependency structure between features and prioritizes those that are similar across distributions. This has previously been shown to significantly improve accuracy on predictions from a mismatched distribution, overcoming the limitations of traditional supervised models. Unfortunately, wenda requires training a Gaussian process model for each feature separately, which is computationally expensive and resists parallelization, making it infeasible for researchers to use at genome-scale. We have developed and implemented a modified form of the underlying algorithm, called wenda_gpu, which allows for fast, efficient model training for genome-scale datasets on a single GPU-enabled computer. Our implementation exploits both quasi-Newtonian parameter optimization and the computational power of GPUs for significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy. Our implementation is able to tackle training tasks on data at the scale of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which was infeasible without our technical advances. We demonstrate the use of wenda_gpu on a range of TCGA-scale prediction tasks, making it possible to build accurate, predictive models that generalize to target datasets where supervised models could not be trained due to the lack of labeled data. We also trained models from gene expression data for cross-cancer type mutation prediction, which outperformed a regular elastic net. We anticipate that wenda_gpu will enable researchers to build accurate predictive models in cases where supervised models were previously not possible due to lack of labeled data, including rare cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82aba530-4a05-4ade-83ff-1c27ba676672\/@w03B8ZAa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15847"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ariel A.

Recent studies point to genetic and phenotypic differences between tumors in patient populations with differing genetic ancestries, and to the need for more data collection to power research in this area. We sought to facilitate such analysis by developing computational tools for genetic ancestry inference from cancer-derived molecular data, without the need for the patient&#8217;s cancer-free genotype or self-declared race or ethnicity. The ability to perform such inference accurately would unlock vast amounts of such data for ancestry-oriented studies of cancer from two major sources. One is the body of data stored by similar massive digital repositories. The other is the body of archival tumor tissues from which molecular data may be generated.<br \/>Methods: We developed methods for genetic ancestry inference from cancer-derived whole exomes, transcriptomes and targeted gene panels, in the absence of matching cancer-free genomic data. These are adaptive, endowed with the ability to optimize their performance for each input cancer-derived molecular profile. As a result, these inference methods perform consistently, and with quantifiable accuracy, across a range of profiling depths and qualities, and mitigate cancer-related damage to the genome, such as somatic copy-number variation.<br \/>Results: We examined the performance of these tools with molecular data from three cancer types: pancreatic and ovarian cancers as representative of epithelial tumor types, and acute myeloid leukemia as an example of hematopoietic malignancy. Three molecular data types were considered: whole-exome sequences, exome sequences targeting a panel of cancer-related genes and RNA sequences. The inference accuracy was found to be consistently above 97% across the three cancers and the three data types.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of accurate inference of genetic ancestry from cancer-derived data, with no need for matching cancer-free genotypes. Computational tools for this purpose will be made available as open-source software.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f41f5343-beeb-436f-9001-73fbd5182fa2\/@w03B8ZAa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Bioinformatics,Cancer genomics,Risk factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15851"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pascal Belleau<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Astrid Deschênes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David A.

Current strategies for analyzing pooled CRISPR screens usually rely on signals from single guide RNAs (sgRNA) with differential relative abundance between two experimental conditions. However, conventional approaches are susceptible to false positives and false negatives driven by outlier cell clones, since the sgRNA abundance does not account for the heterogeneous phenotypes resulting from different editing outcomes of the same sgRNA. To overcome this, we added DNA barcodes to each sgRNA to create unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for CRISPR libraries and developed a companion analytical platform that enables robust, industry-scale CRISPR screens. Here, we present UMIBB, a novel nonparametric Bayesian approach for analyzing UMI-CRISPR data. The number of UMIs with normalized count depletion or enrichment compared to the control experimental condition for each sgRNA is modeled by a beta-binomial distribution. The gene level statistics are derived by combining z-scores of the sgRNAs level posterior probabilities weighted by the number of UMIs in each sgRNA. This approach minimizes the impact of outlier cell clones on statistics and prioritizes genes with consistent count differentials across multiple UMIs in each gene. To assess the power of UMIBB, we benchmarked it on a low coverage (200X) genome-scale negative-selection screen, comparing with results from a high coverage (1000X) screen. These screens were conducted on KRAS mutant cancer celllines (A549) treated with trametinib or vehicle control. Despite the high noise level usually observed in lower coverage screens, our method was able to uncover most of the validated sensitizer genes for trametinib and achieved the highest sensitivity compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, we applied UMIBB on a genome-scale positive-selection screen and successfully identified novel genes (<i>RAD18<\/i> and <i>UBE2K<\/i>) as key mediators of <i>USP1<\/i> dependency in <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutant cell lines. Our studies demonstrate that UMIBB is highly robust against false positives due to clonal heterogeneity and is more likely to identify true genetic interactions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/34dce756-8937-4026-bc7f-13a6ec391490\/@w03B8ZAa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 Statistical methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR,Single cell,Bioinformatics,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15852"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ashley Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Meier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Fenoglio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tianshu Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Engel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Binzhang Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shangtao Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teng Teng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tenzing Khendu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jannik Andersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuewen Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yi Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Although low grade (G1) and high grade (G3\/G4) tumors have been shown to predict patient survival in many cancers, an intermediate histological grade (G2) does not have clear prognostic significance. Therefore, to allow a more accurate assessment of a patient&#8217;s risk, recent studies have focused on utilizing gene expression data to improve prognostic stratification of tumors into either a high-risk or low-risk group. Here, we present a molecular-based classifier that can use gene expression data from both RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarray profiling to achieve accurate prediction of tumor grade for breast cancer (BRCA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The tumor grade predictor was developed by training a machine-learning algorithm to classify tumors into categories of low (mG1) and high (mG3\/mG4) molecular grades for each cancer type using rank transformation of gene expression data from multiple datasets. This resulted in the revealing of features of the mG3\/mG4 groups not shown by histological methods (i.e., the Warburg effect, proliferation signaling pathways, inactivation of tumor suppressors, fibrotic and immunosuppressive microenvironment, and the loss of normal cell morphology), allowing for a more accurate stratification between the high- and low-grade groups. Importantly, by using rank transformation to analyze data from both RNA-seq and microarray profiling, the predictor functioned independent of various sources of batch effect, resulting in the ability to work with single samples and not only datasets. Validation of the tumor grade classifier with pathological classification of G1 and G3\/G4 samples from RNA-seq and microarray expression data into mG1 and mG3\/mG4 groups showed a more accurate performance than other gene expression-based methods, which was demonstrated by it&#8217;s sensitivity-specificity value (AUC scores: BRCA - 0.95, LUAD - 0.89, ccRCC - 0.83). Further, cox-regression analysis showed that prognostic value of mG1 and mG3 groups were comparable to histological grades (BRCA - 0.71 vs. 0.71; LUAD - 0.66 vs. 0.62; ccRCC - 0.74 vs. 0.71), demonstrating the ability of the classifiers to successfully split G2 histological samples into molecular grades. In conclusion, we developed a tumor grade predictor that utilizes expression data from multiple datasets to accurately classify tumors for three cancer types. The resulting prognostic ability of the molecular grades demonstrates their capability of assessing the levels of risk for G2 samples, suggesting the potential for molecular-based tumor grade classifiers to be used in future clinical application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c86b86be-3f16-4b06-a700-269fbe2b9ef0\/@w03B8ZAa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Renal cell carcinoma,Lung adenocarcinoma,tumor grade predictor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21041"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"640eb362-217a-4853-8923-4de551e68954","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/640eb362-217a-4853-8923-4de551e68954\/@w03B8ZAa\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zoya Antysheva<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria V.

The NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) Platform allows users to collect RNA expression data from manually selected Regions of Interest (ROIs) on FFPE tissue sections. Here, we extensively evaluated data from the DSP platform with its associated pipeline and identify significant background noise interference issues which compromise data interpretation. Alternative and more suitable workflows are presented for correct data analysis.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: In this study, 12 paired tumor samples were collected from six glioma patients who underwent two separate resections. For all patients, the first resection was a low grade astrocytoma (WHO grade II or III) and the second resection was a high grade astrocytoma (WHO grade IV). The DSP platform was used to collect expression data of 1,800 genes from 72 ROIs (i.e. 6 per sample). Biological replicates were made of eight tumors from four patients. Gene expression data was normalized with both standard NanoString methods and several alternative methods (e.g. DeSeq2, gamma fit correction and quantile normalization). Weighted Gene Co-expression Network analysis (WGCNA) was used for biological validation. In addition to our own study, six publicly available NanoString DSP datasets were evaluated.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Data distributions of all glioma samples, when exposed to standard data processing, were burdened with significant background noise interference. Notably, differences in noise interference were largest between biologically distinct tumor subgroups (i.e. between first and second glioma resections), which was confirmed in replicate experiments. The noise interference patterns were also present in all six publicly available NanoString DSP datasets which will invariably lead to incorrect interpretation of the underlying biology. To correct for noise interference, we tested several normalization methods. The relatively crude quantile normalization method provided the least biased result and showed the highest concordance with bulk RNA sequencing data. To evaluate the biological validity of our alternative approach, we used T cell counts from our tissue regions as an independent parameter, that were quantified using immune fluorescence. Unsupervised WGCNA identified gene clusters enriched for lymphocyte genes that highly correlated with T cell quantities in ROIs, confirming that alternative normalization can extract a biological signal from the DSP platform.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: The DSP Platform platform suffers from significant noise interference when using standard analysis tools that obscure its results. Here, we revised the workflow and provide an alternative normalization that adequately addresses noise interference and enables correct interpretation of gene expression data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-01 Analytic pipeline optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Spatially resolved transcriptomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21489"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Levi Van Hijfte<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marjolein Geurts<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wies R.
