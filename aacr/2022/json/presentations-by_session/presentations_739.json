[{"Abstract":"Background: Vidu is a first-in-class CpG-A TLR9 agonist in a virus-like particle that activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), thus bridging innate and adaptive immunity. Intratumoral (IT) vidu alone or in combination with intravenous (IV) anti-PD-(L)1 has shown evidence of antitumor activity in pts with anti-PD-(L)1-refractory melanoma or NSCLC. As biomarkers associated with anti-PD-(L)1 response were not predictive of vidu activity, we sought to identify novel transcriptional signatures.<br \/>Methods: RNA-Seq was performed on baseline biopsies from pts with anti-PD-(L)1-refractory melanoma (NCT02680184; RECIST v1.1 responders [R; n=20]; nonresponders [NR; n=78; 30 pts with stable disease + 48 pts with progressive disease [PD]]) or NSCLC (NCT03438318; N=11) treated with vidu &#177; anti-PD-(L)1. IFNg18 signature was used to characterize melanomas as non-T cell-inflamed (non-Tinfl), T cell-inflamed (Tinfl), or intermediate. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using MSigDB and other signatures (&#62;19,000) was performed on non-Tinfl melanoma in R vs NR (false discovery rate [FDR] &#60;0.25). Deconvolution of immune cells was performed using TIMER2.0. Prediction models were generated using QLattice. Signatures were characterized using both publicly available bulk and single-cell (sc) RNA-Seq datasets of pDC subsets or PD-1\/CTLA-4 blockade response datasets.<br \/>Results: GSEA on non-Tinfl melanoma biopsies revealed 2 gene signatures (COPII vesicle and Golgi targeting) most strongly associated with R (FDR &#60;0.16). Leading edge analysis of these signatures identified 35 common core genes (CC) that strongly differentiated RECIST 1.1 R vs PD. As independent validation, CC enrichment was also significantly associated with R in intermediate melanoma (p=0.009) and with tumor shrinkage in NSCLC (p=0.027). CC was significantly associated with R to vidu single-agent or combination treatment, but not with clinical baseline prognostic factors or IFNg18. In Tinfl melanoma, CC was not associated with R, but myeloid signatures were significantly associated with NR. A model based on CC and transcription factor <i>ELF2<\/i> predicted R in melanoma (AUC 0.93 [95% CI 0.82-1.00]). In public datasets, CC was not associated with R to PD-1\/CTLA-4 blockade, but CC was highly expressed in the type I interferon-secreting subset of pDCs and some myeloid cells. CC expression was prevalent in most tumor types and was independent of IFNg18 in TCGA.<br \/>Conclusion: In pts with anti-PD-1-refractory melanoma or NSCLC, transcriptional signatures of COPII vesicle and Golgi targeting (functionally related to TLR9 activation) were associated with antitumor activity of IT vidu &#177; IV anti-PD-(L)1. Ongoing bulk and sc RNA-Seq analyses may clarify the underlying biology and the signature&#8217;s potential role as a predictive biomarker for clinical response to vidu.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49526b8c-3057-4e4b-ac75-c5fa936602b6\/@t03B8ZX4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,Melanoma\/skin cancers,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"bc3f7a24-02b2-4fa1-934d-5e8f08105fa6","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bc3f7a24-02b2-4fa1-934d-5e8f08105fa6\/@t03B8ZX4\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hong Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luping Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ping Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riyue Bao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason J.

RUX discontinuation rate within 5 years is approximately 40%, and patients have poor prognosis after discontinuing RUX [1]. The definition of disease modification in MF is evolving. Reversal of bone marrow fibrosis (BMF) and reduction in driver gene variant allele frequency (VAF) have been suggested as evidence of disease modification; however, clinical benefits derived from achieving these responses have not been fully elucidated. Ultimately, benefits in patient survival are requisite to claim true clinically meaningful disease modification. There is also an unmet need of effective therapies for patients with MF with high molecular risk (HMR) mutations (<i>ASXL1<\/i>, <i>EZH<\/i>2, <i>IDH1\/2<\/i>, <i>SRSF<\/i>2, and <i>U2AF1<\/i> Q157). REFINE (NCT03222609) is a phase 2 trial evaluating navitoclax (NAV), a BCL-X<sub>L<\/sub>\/BCL-2 inhibitor, combined with RUX, in patients with MF who progressed on or had a suboptimal response to RUX monotherapy. Here, we report the exploratory analyses assessing BMF, VAF, and HMR with respect to outcomes. As BMF improvements were often observed in patients who achieved &#8805;35% reduction in spleen volume (SVR<sub>35<\/sub>), we explored if the survival benefit observed was due to this potentially disease modification-related response. All statistics were descriptive. As of May 6, 2021, 34 patients were enrolled in Cohort 1a and received &#8805;1 dose of NAV plus RUX. Of these, 32 were evaluable for BMF and 12 (38%) had &#8805;1 grade improvement during anytime on study, 4 of whom improved by 2 grades. For driver gene VAF reductions, 26 patients (<i>JAK<\/i>2, n=19; <i>CALR<\/i>,<i> <\/i>n=7) were evaluable and 6 (23%) achieved &#8805;20% reduction at Week 24. Five patients achieved both BMF and VAF responses. Median overall survival (OS) for patients who had &#8805;1 grade improvement in BMF was not reached compared with 28.5 months for those without improvement (P &#60;0.01). Similarly, the median OS was also not reached for patients who achieved &#8805;20% VAF reduction versus 28.5 months for those who did not (P=0.05). Furthermore, no deaths were observed in patients with improvements in BMF or VAF. Within the patient group who had an SVR<sub>35<\/sub> response at any time, median OS was not reached in those who had improved BMF (n=9), compared with an OS of 28.5 months for patients without BMF improvement (n=6; P &#60;0.01). Of 34 patients, 33 were evaluable for molecular risk; 19 (58%) had HMR and 14 (42%) were without (non-HMR); at the time of analysis, median OS was not reached in either subgroup; there was no statistical significance in survival between HMR and non-HMR groups. Taken together, the results of these analyses demonstrate the ability of NAV, combined with RUX, to induce BMF improvement and VAF reduction. These responses are suggestive of disease modification as<br \/>they were associated with improved OS for patients. In addition, the NAV plus RUX regimen potentially improved the outcome for patients with MF regardless of HMR status.<br \/>Reference 1. Palandri F, Breccia M, Bonifacio M, et al.

Early detection is critical for improving pancreatic cancer prognosis, but biomarkers for early detection are lacking. We conducted a two-stage study to identify circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer early detection using pre-diagnostic plasma samples, collected within 5 years prior to cancer diagnosis, from case-control studies nested in five prospective studies. The discovery stage included 185 case-control pairs from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial. Replication stage samples comprised 277 case-control pairs from diverse cohorts: Shanghai Women&#8217;s and Men&#8217;s Health Studies, Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), and Multiethnic Cohort. Controls were individually matched on age at enrollment, sex, recruitment site (SCCS), race\/ethnicity, and date of blood draw in each cohort. Cell-free small RNAs were extracted from plasma samples and miRNAs were measured by the NanoString nCounter Analysis System using the Human v3 miRNA Expression panel (a total of 798 miRNAs). Normalized miRNAs were categorized by decile. For miRNAs that have &#8805;10% samples with an undetectable level (0), the non-zero level was categorized by approximately 10% increment. Associations of circulating miRNAs with pancreatic cancer risk, measured in odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per decile change, were calculated using conditional logistic regression analyses in discovery and replication studies, separately within each cohort, and results meta-analyzed. We identified three miRNAs, hsa-miR-199a-3p+\/hsa-miR-199b-3p, hsa-miR-191-5p, hsa-miR-767-5p, being consistently associated with pancreatic risk in both discovery and replication sets, with combined ORs (95% CIs) of 0.89 (0.84-0.95), 0.90 (0.85-0.95), and 1.08 (1.02-1.13), and P of 9.09E-05, 6.95E-05 and 4.03E-03, respectively. Adjustment for age, BMI, smoking, diabetes and family history of pancreatic cancer did not change the associations. Stratified analyses by age at diagnosis found five additional replicated miRNAs: hsa-miR-640, hsa-miR-1299, hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-874-5p, and hsa-miR-449b-5p among those 65 years or older, with combined ORs (95% CIs) of 1.33 (1.16-1.52), 1.28 (1.12-1.46), 0.76 (0.65-0.89), 1.25 (1.09-1.43), and 1.22 (1.07-1.39), and P-value ranging from 4.75E-05 to 0.003.

Early detection of cancer via the cell free DNA represents the broadest vision and requires highly specificity. Ongoing disease monitoring is another important application of liquid biopsy and requires high sensitivity. Assay development requires analytical validation, and assays must be monitored for ongoing performance. These assays demand reference materials at specific variant allele frequencies for the assessment of specificity and sensitivity. Previously, obtaining reference materials was a laborious process of finding or engineering mutant cell lines. Here, we describe the design, manufacture, and quality control of a synthetic reference standard: the Twist Pan-Cancer Reference Standards, developed using Twist&#8217;s proprietary DNA printing platform to include a wide selection of both common and rare cancer targets for analytical validation. The reference material closely mimics the size distribution and content of cell-free DNA, with a primary peak at 167 bp and a secondary peak at 334 bp. The background cfDNA is derived from a single donor and highly characterized through NGS. The reference standard includes over 400 variant sites across 84 genes, including literature-curated, clinically-relevant variant sites. Additional panel-wide variants were included to aid in troubleshooting capture panels. The variant DNA is synthetically printed at 167 bp &#177; 5 bp and tiles over the site with extensive overlap, providing diversity of DNA termini relative to the position of the site of variation. Variant sites were printed and quantified independently so they can be pooled uniformly. NGS quality controls are implemented at multiple steps to ensure quality. The final products are available in a variant allele frequency (VAF) dilution series. The dilution series is quality controlled using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to ensure precision of variant allele frequencies. The Twist Pan Cancer Reference Standards provide a valuable solution for NGS-based assay developers seeking reference materials for a wide array of cancer variants, advancing adoption of liquid biopsy tests toward routine clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/45d4568c-6f7e-4771-99c0-523dc588c493\/@t03B8ZX4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,cfDNA,reference standard,Assay development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patrick D.

To our knowledge, this is the largest ctDNA study in breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.<br \/>Methods: Blood samples were collected at pre-treatment (T0), during treatment (T1 at 3 weeks, and T2 at 12 weeks) and after NAC (T3 at 24 weeks) from 106 HR+\/HER2- and 97 TNBC patients. Plasma samples (n=734) were analyzed using a personalized and tumor-informed mPCR NGS-based ctDNA test (SignateraTM). Patients, all high risk for recurrence by MammaPrint, received paclitaxel-based treatment +\/- experimental therapy followed by anthracycline. The median follow-up was 3.0 years (0.5 to 6.5). The predictive and prognostic value of ctDNA dynamics and status at different timepoints were examined. Our analysis is exploratory and does not adjust for other biomarkers.<br \/>Results: Pretreatment ctDNA positivity (Fisher p&#60;0.0001) and levels (mean tumor molecules\/mL, MTM\/mL, t test p=0.0062) were significantly higher in TNBC (90.7%, 14.7 MTM\/mL) than in high risk HR+\/HER2- (66.0%, 5.5 MTM\/mL). Early and late ctDNA clearance during treatment (3 and 12 weeks of NAC) was predictive of pathologic complete response (pCR) and residual cancer burden (RCB), class 0-III, in TNBC but not HR+\/HER2- (Table). In both subtypes: (1) ctDNA was a significant negative prognostic factor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) at all timepoints (p&#60;0.05) except at pretreatment; (2) all patients who achieved pCR were ctDNA-negative after NAC; (3) among non-responding patients, ctDNA-negativity after NAC was associated with improved DRFS (Table).<br \/>Conclusions: The predictive value of ctDNA for prediction of pCR and RCB differed between subtypes (HR+\/HER2- vs. TNBC), while similar prognostic value was observed. In TNBC, early clearance of ctDNA at 3 weeks was a significant predictor of favorable response to NAC. Compared to patients who were ctDNA-positive after NAC, ctDNA-negative status in both subtypes was associated with improved DRFS even in patients with residual cancer (no pCR or RCB-II\/III). These findings could inform on the design of future studies that seek to demonstrate the utility of ctDNA in the curative setting.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{B520FE7B-68C2-46FF-B578-790F2A38C08A}\"><caption>Predictive and prognostic significance of ctDNA in early breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>HR+HER2- (n=106)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>TNBC (n=97)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Predictive value for prediction of pCR and RCB<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Fisher p-value\u0009<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Fisher p-value\u0009<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Early ctDNA clearance (between T0 and T1) and pCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.4521<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Late ctDNA clearance (between T0 and T2) and pCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.8071\u0009<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0004<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Early ctDNA clearance (between T0 and T1) and RCB&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">(0-III)<\/span><span style=\"font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: medium;\"><\/span><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.1360\u0009<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Late ctDNA clearance (between T0 and T2) and RCB&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">(0-III)<\/span><span style=\"font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: medium;\"><\/span><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.4869<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0004<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Early ctDNA clearance at T1 and pCR rates<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>pCR rate<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>pCR rate<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ctDNA clearance (ctDNA+ at T0\/ctDNA- at T1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">67%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Late ctDNA clearance (betweeNo early clearance (ctDNA+ at T0\/ctDNA+ at T1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Prognostic value for prediction of DRFS<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">L<b>og rank p-value<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Log rank p-value<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">ctDNA at T3 and pCR vs no PCR<\/span><span style=\"font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: medium;\"><\/span><br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0002<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">ctDNA at T3 and RCB (0-I vs II-III)<\/span><span style=\"font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: medium;\"><\/span><br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0110<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><i>Timepoints: T0 - pretreatment; T1 - three weeks after treatment initiation; T2 - at 12 weeks, between paclitaxel-based and anthracycline regimens; T3- after neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery<\/i><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/238b1f6c-ee4c-459e-8df5-f557c0ad74c5\/@t03B8ZX4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Breast cancer,Predictive biomarkers,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mark Jesus Mendoza Magbanua<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lamorna Brown Swigart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derrick Renner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svetlana Shchegrova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gillian L.

Radiotherapy monitoring currently largely relies on longitudinal imaging with spatial and limited functional information on therapy response. Particularly, discrimination of radiotherapy effect on the tumor versus healthy tissue can be challenging and imaging response may lag behind actual response on the tumor cell level. Liquid biopsy monitoring promises to complement imaging by providing systemic biological information about the effects of radiotherapy. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood plasma contains genetic and epigenetic information about cell death processes, and cfDNA monitoring may thus lend itself to observing both tumor response and normal-tissue toxicity during radiotherapy.<br \/>Methods: Seven polymetastatic patients, seven healthy volunteers, seven oligometastatic patients (OMD) and seven head-and neck cancer patients (H&#38;N) were recruited for the study. OMD patients received stereotactic body radiation therapy in 5 fractions of 5-10 Gy, heterogeneously prescribed, while H&#38;N underwent homogeneously 2 Gy radiation to a total dose of 70 Gy. Blood samples were collected from all patients at baseline and from patients undergoing radiotherapy twice during and twice after treatment, with samples collected up to six months after treatment. cfDNA was isolated and low-pass (7x) whole-genome sequencing was performed to examine fragment-length distribution and copy number alterations. We applied in silico size selection for 90 to 150 bp long fragments to improve copy number variant detection. Clinical measures and imaging findings were compared to cfDNA fragment analysis.<br \/>Results: Samples showing high circulating tumor DNA content in copy number analysis (tMAD&#38;gt;0.03) also showed a higher proportion of short fragments (80-100 bp) compared to the samples of healthy individuals (ANOVA: p=0.0216, Tukey-pairwise: p=0.0287), whereas samples with low circulating tumor content did not (Tukey-pairwise: p=0.7540). We observed rapidly declining tumor fraction under treatment in a patient with prostate cancer and a high tMAD value at baseline. However, in the follow-up sample, residual tumor was detectable in the cfDNA copy number analysis, which was further confirmed by increasing PSA values. We observed a significant increase in the fraction of fragments between 200 and 250 bp in response to the treatment in oligometastatic patients receiving high-intensity radiotherapy, which returned to baseline in the follow-up measurements (ANOVA: p=0.0252, Tukey-pairwise: p=0.3138). A similar trend was observable (ANOVA: p=0.37) in head-and-neck patients, who received lower fractions of radiotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: Applying low-pass whole-genome cfDNA-sequencing, we were able to monitor radiotherapy response in oligometastatic and head-and-neck cancer patients. We have also observed short-term increase in the number fragments between 200 and 250 bp during treatment, which we hypothesize to be a necrotic signal. The minimal invasive nature and the relatively low cost of low-pass cfDNA-sequencing makes it a viable method for frequent monitoring, which may allow prediction of tumor response and patient outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bf634052-dcb5-4fc7-b6ff-c2029e84c247\/@t03B8ZX4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Radiotherapy,Head and neck cancers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zsolt Balazs<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivna Ivankovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Panagiotis Balermpas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todor Gitchev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Willmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Krauthammer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolaus Andratschke<\/i><\/presenter>.

To identify genomic biomarkers for clear cell RCC (ccRCC) risk-stratification we interrogated somatic mutation status of 12 RCC-relevant genes using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in tumor-normal pairs from 943 patients with matched follow up data from the Cancer Genomics of the Kidney (CAGEKID) study. We examined associations between genomically-defined patient groups, explained below, and disease-free as well as RCC-specific survival independently in two cohorts of patients (N=469 for cohort 1; 474 for cohort 2). We used the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests to compare survival functions, and Cox proportional hazards models to stratify for patient stage and age to estimate association of each group with survival. RCC-specific survival was assessed with a competing-risks method to include deaths from other causes. Within these cohorts, 76.4% of patients harbored somatic mutations in <i>VHL<\/i>, the most common driver gene in ccRCC. The most commonly mutated genes within VHL-mutated tumors were <i>PBRM1<\/i> (39.7%), <i>SETD2<\/i> (19%), <i>BAP1<\/i> (14.3%), and <i>KDM5C<\/i> (8.3%). Less frequently mutated genes included <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>COL11A1<\/i>, <i>DMD<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, and <i>TRRAP<\/i> (~3-5%).Among VHL-driven tumors, we identified a new genomic classifier on the basis of the number of mutations in additional RCC driver genes in the panel examined. Patients were classified based on the presence of mutations only in <i>VHL<\/i> (VHL+0), those with mutations in <i>VHL<\/i> and one other driver gene (VHL+1), two other driver genes (VHL+2), and 3 or more other driver genes (VHL&#8805;3). We observed within both cohorts that both the risk of disease recurrence as well as RCC-specific death were associated with an increased number of mutations within this classification. When stratified for patient stage and age, the hazard-ratio for 5-year disease-free survival for VHL&#8805;3 patients was 6.69 (p=0.000212), 4.31 for VHL+2 (p=0.000862), and 2.43 for VHL+1 (p=0.035662), compared to patients with only mutations in <i>VHL<\/i>. These observations were replicated in the second patient cohort, with hazards ratios of 4.55, 2.49, and 1.40, for VHL&#8805;3, VHL+2, and VHL+1 classified patients respectively, indicating that risk of disease recurrence increases with the number of driver mutations. Notably, tumor mutational burden (TMB) was not significantly different between the aforementioned groups, demonstrating that our classifier is independent of TMB. We created a model based on a set of 12 RCC-relevant genes, which can predict risk of relapse for the ~80% of patients with ccRCC that are VHL-driven. This classification can be defined based on a small panel of genes, making it easily applicable to the clinic, in the context of tumor or liquid biopsy analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/94896fe0-c299-45a0-8699-de885b01de80\/@t03B8ZX4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Genomics,Prognostic markers,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kate I.

In many other tumor types, radiotherapy is a mainstay therapy whose anti-tumor effects have partially been ascribed to T cell responses. The role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in radiotherapy tumor responses remains unclear. Here, we focused on the role of NK cells in radiotherapy of pancreatic cancer.<br \/>In a randomized controlled pancreatic cancer trial, we found that CXCL8 serum levels increased under radiotherapy and NK cells positively correlated with prolonged overall patient survival. Accordingly, NK cells preferentially infiltrated irradiated tumors and exhibited CD56dim like cytotoxic transcriptomic states. In preclinical experimental systems in mice and tumor cells, NF-&#954;B and mTOR signaling prompted radiation-induced CXCL8 secretion from senescent tumor cells causing directional migration of CD56dim NK cells into tumors. Thus, we link senescence-associated CXCL8 release to innate immune surveillance of human tumors. Moreover, combined radiotherapy and adoptive NK cell transfer improved tumor control over monotherapies in xenografted mice suggesting NK cells combined with radiotherapy as a rational cancer treatment strategy which may be integrated into PDAC treatment algorithms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/825f6384-a24d-4714-8341-6702b28fd7c6\/@u03B8ZX5\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-05 Radiation-immunotherapy and other radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Natural killer cells,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thomas Walle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joscha A.

Rapid identification of live CTCs may help to predict BCa prognosis and identify which patients may derive treatment benefit, especially for those with metastatic disease. However, CTCs are present at very low concentrations in the peripheral blood, and CTC enumeration is costly and technically challenging. We previously reported that cell-size based device utilizing a microfluidic cassette could be used to isolate live blood cells (Zhang et al. 2019 AACR). Here we describe a pilot study using novel microfluidic Parsortix workflow to identify live CTCs for patients with Stage IV BCa.<br \/>Methods: Four whole blood samples (7.5ml\/each) were collected from each of 10 patients with stage IV BCa patients who had continued clinical progression of their disease on systemic therapy, under a Northwestern University IRB-approved study (NU20B03). All samples were stored at 15-30 &#176;C in EDTA tubes. Live CTCs enrichment was performed using a cell size and deformability based Parsortix system (Angle) which utilizes a microfluidic based disposable cassette containing a step separation structure. The four samples from each patient were loaded onto the device and the separation procedure was started by using 4.5&#956;m, 6.5&#956;m 8&#956;m and 10&#956;m separation cassettes, respectively. After separation and cleaning, the CTCs captured by the Parsortix system were harvested by inverting the flow direction and then flushing from the cassette in 200&#956;L PBS. The harvested CTCs were multi-stained directly by fluorescence labeled antibodies for Anti-CK-PE (specific for epithelial cells), DAPI (for nucleus), anti-CD45-APC (specific for leukocytes) (Menarini). Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to identify the CTCs which were classified as CK<sup>+<\/sup>, DAPI<sup>+<\/sup> and CD45<sup>-<\/sup>. White blood cells from patient samples and the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.<br \/>Results: A total of 500 and 200 MDA-MB-231 cells were processed as controls, which were collected completely by Parsortix and identified by FCM confirming that Parsortix system could recover the CTCs effectively. CTCs were classified based on morphology and phenotype as CK+, DAPI+ and CD45-. Live CTCs (&#8805;1) were detected in 8 out of 10 (80%), 9 out of 10 (90%), 7 out of 10 (70%) and 5 out of 10 (50%) samples by using 4.5&#956;m (Group 1), 6.5&#956;m (Group 2), 8&#956;m (Group 3) and 10&#956;m (Group 4) separation cassettes. Maximum CTCs isolated from each group were 18, 32, 12 and 8 from Group 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The corresponding average CTCs isolated from each sample were 3.5 CTCs, 5.6 CTCs, 2.5 CTCs and 1.7 CTCs from Group 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The 6.5&#956;m cassettes (Group 2) using for CTCs collection had significantly higher efficacy on collection of CTCs compared to other three groups.<br \/>Conclusions: In this pilot study, our findings demonstrated that the cell-sized dependent Parsortix system using multiple staining and FCM is an effective and specific approach for rapid recovery and identification of CTCs from Stage IV BCa patients. With further optimization, this strategy can help to accurately evaluate CTCs and offers a potential technique for diagnosis and treatmentmonitoring of patients with metastatic breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Circulating tumor cells,Flow cytometry,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qiang Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marwa Manai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Davis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolina Reduzzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo D’Amico<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saya Liz Jacob<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianhua Jiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weijun Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Flaum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amir Behdad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massimo Cristofanilli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ami Shad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leonidas Platanias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Gradishar<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the United States, African American (AA) individuals carry a disproportionate share of the lung cancer burden, with higher incidence, later-stage diagnosis, and poorer 5-year overall survival rate when compared with that of Whites. However, there is yet to be a race-specific biomarker for lung cancer. Most genomic data continue to include a small proportion of AA individuals, further contributing to the racial health disparity. Thus, the goal of our study was to conduct a genome-wide analysis to identify lung cancer biomarkers specific for AA individuals, to understand the role that these biomarkers play in overall survival, and to discover how epigenetic modulations may impact outcomes by race.<br \/>Methods: We utilized clinical and genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We conducted a differential expression analysis to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) amongst AA individuals compared with Whites with LUAD. Two-tailed log rank tests with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models adjusted by age, gender, prior malignancy and stage were used to analyze overall survival for mRNA expression and DNA methylation for each racial subgroup. We investigated the epigenetic modifications that are correlated with the expression of the DEGs that play a significant role in the survival of AA individuals with lung cancer.<br \/>Results: CEACAM7 was the single gene that was both differentially expressed in AA individuals compared to Whites with LUAD and that had an impact on LUAD survival. CEACAM7 RNA expression showed trend towards significant direct correlation with LUAD stage in AA individuals but not for Whites. High RNA expression of CEACAM7 was associated with shorter median survival (P&#60;0.0001) and increased mortality risk HR: 11.84, 95% CI: 2.69-52.17 for AA individuals with LUAD, but there were no differences in survival time or risk for Whites. We also identified 5 CpG probes inversely correlated with the expression of CEACAM7 (cg22895231, cg25465322, cg01656853, cg17659920, and cg07940585). Each one of them showed that low methylation values had significantly shorter overall median survival. Only cg01656853 and cg07940585 showed association between lower DNA methylation levels and increased mortality risk in multivariate COX regression models.<br \/>Conclusion: This TCGA study suggests that the expression of CEACAM7 and its associated DNA methylation may play an important role in the survival of AA individuals with LUAD but not for Whites. Further studies are necessary to understand the mechanics of how the epigenetic regulation of CEACAM7 is associated with survival in AA individuals with LUAD and to identify new possible therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f32dda75-bc05-41fc-9cbe-6d1a09a6c5c5\/@u03B8ZX5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Prognosis,Race,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"95a5153b-c4a1-4d07-99df-f0f8d75ffcdb","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95a5153b-c4a1-4d07-99df-f0f8d75ffcdb\/@u03B8ZX5\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Richies Tiv<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ignacio Jusue-Torres<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Apurva Mallisetty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leglys Contreras-Vargas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludmila Danilova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lawrence E.

Discovering effective combination therapies and selecting patients to maximize therapeutic benefit are challenging due to the complexity of the molecular landscape of drug responses. Here, we provide a comprehensive resource of precision combination therapies tailored to oncogenic co-alterations that are recurrent across patient cohorts. To generate the resource, we developed REcurrent Features Leveraged for Combination Therapy (REFLECT), which integrates machine learning and cancer informatics algorithms. Based on multi-omic data, the method maps recurrent co-alteration signatures in patient cohorts to combination therapies. The resource matches &#62; 2,000 drug combinations to co-alteration signatures across 201 cohorts stratified from 10,392 patients and 33 cancer types. We validated the REFLECT pipeline using data from patient-derived xenografts (PDX), in vitro drug screens, and combination therapy clinical trials. These validations demonstrate that REFLECT selects combination therapies with significantly improved efficacy, drug synergy, and survival outcomes. In patient cohorts with immunotherapy response markers, HER2 activation, and DNA repair aberrations, we have identified therapeutically actionable and recurrent co-alteration signatures. REFLECT provides a resource and framework to design combination therapies tailored to tumor cohorts in data-driven clinical trials and pre-clinical studies.<b><u><\/u><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e0661b3-7396-4ff2-99d0-bc34f4161de7\/@u03B8ZX5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Bioinformatics,Machine learning,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anil Korkut<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xubin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gonghong Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zeynep Dereli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Behnaz Bozorgui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Parisa Imanirad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Elnaggar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Augustin Luna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Menter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Pilié<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Yap<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Kopetz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Sander<\/i><\/presenter>.

The PIONeeR trial (NCT03493581) aims to predict such resistances through a comprehensive multiparametric biomarkers analysis.<br \/>Methodology: Among the &#62;300 advanced NSCLC patients (pts) recruited in PIONeeR, we focused on the first 137 &#8805;2<sup>nd<\/sup> line ECOG PS0-1 pts treated with single-agent nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab. Tumor tissue was collected at baseline and pts were re-biopsied at 6 weeks, and blood-sampled every cycle throughout the 24 weeks post C1D1. Response to PD1\/L1 ICIs was assessed by RECIST 1.1 every 6 weeks. Immune contexture was characterized in tumor &#38; blood of each pt through FACS for circulating immune cell subtypes quantification and endothelial activation, blood soluble factors dosage, dual- &#38; multiplex IHC \/ digital pathology to quantify immune cells infiltrating the tumor, WES for TMB &#38; ICI plasma dosage, leading to 331 measured biomarkers in addition to routine clinical parameters. Multivariable (MV) logistic regression was used to examine the association of each biomarker (controlled by sex, age, smoking status, histological type &#38; PDL1+ Tumor Cells) with the risk of Early Progression (EP), i.e. within 3.5 months of treatment. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was conducted for association with PFS and OS.<br \/>Results: Overall, the 137 pts were mainly male (64%), smokers (92%) and &#60;70yrs (68%). Tumors were mainly non-squamous (79%) with &#62;1% PDL1+ TC in 36% of the cases, and 21% of pts were still on treatment at data cut-off. Archived samples were available for 80% of pts at inclusion and re-biopsy was available in 52.9% of these cases. The median follow up was 19.8 months, 22.5% of pts did not progress at data cut-off while 62% presented EP. Tumor Cytotoxic T-cells density, especially PD1+ were lower in EP (MV OR=0.45, p=0.022); conversely, higher proportions of circulating cytotoxic T-cells and activated T-cells (HLA-DR+) were observed in EP (MV OR=3.8, p&#60;0.001). Among other biomarkers, Tregs (MV OR=0.44, p=0.018), NK cell subsets (MV OR&#8804;0.44, p&#60;0.05), albumin (MV OR=0.4, p&#60;0.01) and PDL1 TC % (MV OR=0.27, p&#60;0.01) were decreased whereas alkaline phosphatase was increased (OR=3, p=0.018). &#62;65% inter-pt variability was observed in plasma exposures for all ICIs, with 8-10% of pts displaying trough levels below the target engagement threshold. Data will be presented through unsupervised clustering algorithms &#38; multi-modal supervised learning methods. Changes after 6 weeks of treatment will be analyzed to further investigate drugs mechanisms of action.<br \/>Conclusion: The PIONeeR trial provides with the 1<sup>st<\/sup> comprehensive biomarkers&#8217; analysis to establish predictive models of resistance in advanced NSCLC pts treated with PD1\/L1 ICIs and highlights how tumor and circulating biomarkers are complementary.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/38675d5f-5970-40fa-8582-cc9ec53c2e97\/@u03B8ZX5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immune checkpoint blockade,Resistance,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laurent Greillier<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florence Monville<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanina Leca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frédéric Vely<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephane Garcia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Ciccolini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florence Sabatier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gilbert Ferrani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nawel Boudai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lamia Ghezali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcellin Landri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clémence Marin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mourad Hamimed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurent Arnaud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie Karlsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Atsou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sivan Bokobza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pauline Fleury<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arnaud Boyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clarisse Audigier-Valette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stéphanie Martinez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hervé Pegliasco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrice Ray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lionel Falchero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Serre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Cloarec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louisiane Lebas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephane Hominal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Barre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Zahi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed Frikha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre Bory<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maryannick Le Ray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lilian Laborde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virginie Martin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Malkoun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Roumieux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Mazieres<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maurice Perol<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Vivier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastien Benzekry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacques Fieschi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabrice Barlesi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although genetic sequencing helps guide targeted therapy, recent proteogenomic studies emphasized the importance of protein expression in classifying tumor subtypes. Most drugs target proteins, but due to the gap in proteomics technology development, precision cancer treatment is largely based on genetic sequencing rather than proteomic testing. Therefore, to complement existing approaches for treatment and trial matching of lung cancer patients, we developed a multiplexed proteomic assay to quantify 97 biomarkers using small amounts of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue.<br \/>Methods: Candidate biomarkers were selected based on known biology and clinical relevance; unique proteotypic peptides were selected to have minimal biological and analytical complications. To build the assays, light and stable isotope-labeled standard peptides were analyzed with mass spectrometry to select fragment ions and optimize collision energies. Using a matrix prepared from 25 NSCLC cell lines, reverse calibration curves were used to evaluate assay sensitivity and linearity; repeatability experiments were also used to evaluate assay performance. When needed, samples were reviewed by a pathologist and processed with filter-aided sample preparation (Wi&#347;niewski <i>et al<\/i>. <i>Nat Methods.<\/i> 2009, <i>6<\/i>, 359).<br \/>Results: The multiplexed LC-MRM assay was successfully applied to NSCLC cell lines (n = 25), FFPE specimens (n = 30) and frozen tissues (n = 108). The resulting data differentiated subtypes of 25 NSCLC cell lines and frozen lung squamous cell carcinomas (LSCC) based on the expression levels of proteins to assess tumor phenotype, cancer signaling, and immune status. The samples prepared from FFPE sections with limited sizes demonstrated compatibility with biopsies. The LC-MRM data from tumor specimens were consistent with pathology evaluations. Finally, the 108 tumors from LSCC patients could be grouped into subtypes, including immune hot and immune cold tumors based on B and T cell markers. Quantitation of cancer antigens can also assist with direction of immunotherapy. In the future, we will explore the MRM assay results of 108 LSCC tissues by comparing to previous proteogenomics results (Stewart <i>et al<\/i>. <i>Nat. Commun. <\/i>2019, 10, 3578) to better understand the tumor biology.<br \/>Conclusions: A highly multiplexed targeted proteomics assay was developed and applied to quantify biomarkers in lung cancer cell lines, FFPE sections, and frozen tumor tissues. Further, we will implement the MRM assay with tumor biopsies to enable therapy selection and trial matching.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/59dfa2f7-16b0-464c-9274-e0b8e0806ea1\/@u03B8ZX5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Lung cancer,Therapeutic proteins,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sudhir Putty Reddy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aileen Alontaga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul A.
