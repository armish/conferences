[{"Abstract":"The CDK4\/6 inhibitor, palbociclib (PAL), significantly improves progression-free survival and overall survival in HR positive and HER2-negative breast cancer in combination either with letrozole or fulvestrant. However, resistance to the CDK4\/6 inhibition inevitably develops. Preclinical models and clinical transcriptome specimen analysis disclosed that abnormal activation of Cyclin E\/CDK2 due to <i>CCNE <\/i>gene<i> <\/i>amplification was one of the major reasons to CDK4\/6 inhibition resistance. And inhibition of CDK2 either by gene knockdown of <i>CCNE<\/i> or by pharmaceutic approach rescued the sensitivity of resistant tumor cells to CDK4\/6 inhibition. To overcome the resistance, a novel and selective CDK2\/4\/6 inhibitor, SCR-8079 was developed. In biochemical assay, SCR-8079 was demonstrated high potency on inhibiting CDK2\/4\/6 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 3 nM, 1 nM and 2 nM, respectively. And SCR-8079 showed good selectivity over CDK1\/9 isoforms (&#62;60 selectivity folds). SCR-8079 demonstrated closed inhibitory activities both on CDK4\/6 sensitive and resistant lines. In MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line sensitive to PAL, SCR-8079 potently inhibited Rb phosphorylation (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 53 nM) and cell proliferation (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 28 nM). Meanwhile, SCR-8079 showed high potency on inhibiting on the growth of OVCAR3, an ovarian cancer cell line with elevated CDK2 activation and resistance to PAL. SCR-8079 inhibited Rb phosphorylation (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 41 nM) and cell proliferation (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 21 nM). In order to further mimic CDK4\/6 resistance, a PAL resistant line (MCF-7R) was generated via induction of MCF-7 by gradient increased PAL. SCR-8079 potently inhibited MCF-7R cells growth (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 3 nM) but PAL didn&#8217;t (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62;1 &#181;M). Moreover, SCR-8079 showed high potency on growth inhibition in a broad of breast cancer cell lines, including HR-positive, Her2-positive and triple negative lines. SCR-8079 displayed good oral bioavailability in multiple pre-clinical species and robust anti-tumor activities both in OVCAR3 and MCF7 xenograft models. In summary, SCR-8079 is a selective CDK2\/4\/6 inhibitor, which overcomes the <i>CCNE<\/i>-mediated resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibition. Broad anti-tumor activity suggests SCR-8079 central role in breast cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/18d0464c-e4f6-41a8-b5db-ae210f107ebc\/@w03B8ZSB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Resistance,CDK2\/4\/6,CCNE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17829"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Feng Zhou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guimei Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenqing Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liting Xue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renhong Tang<\/i><\/presenter>.

The mitotic checkpoint prevents completion of mitosis until chromosomes have made bipolar kinetochore attachments to microtubules. Previous studies have shown that cells that experience a prolonged prometaphase(&#62;1.5 h) following treatment with microtubule destabilizing drugs will arrest in G1 following eventual exit from mitosis. Given its role in DNA damage checkpoints, p53 appears to be a likely candidate for involvement in this arrest. The goal of the current study is to investigate the role of p53 in this G1 arrest following prolonged prometaphase. Three cells lines were utilized:MCF10A, MCF10A\/&#945;p53 which overexpressed shRNA to p53, and MCF10A\/OD which overexpresses the p53 oligomerization domain. Cells were treated with 9 &#956;M RO-3306 for 18 h to synchronize cells at the G2\/M transition. The RO-3306 was then removed and cells were treated with a microtubule destabilizing drug, nocodazole, at a concentration of 0.08 &#956;M for 1.5 or 2.5 h to cause prometaphase arrest. The cells were then washed to remove nocodazole, and the cells were harvested at various time points and analyzed via flow cytometry and Western blot. Flow cytometry analysis in in all three cell lines showed an accumulation of cells in G1 at 12 hours in for both treatment times (1.5 and 2.5 h), with subsequent increases in sub-G1 populations by 24 hours. Western blot analysis revealed activation of p53 by phosphorylation of ser20 and activation of p21 in the MCF10A and MCF10A\/OD, but not in the MCF10A\/&#945;p53 for both treatment times. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of p53 alone is not sufficient to elicit the G1 arrest, as the MCF10A\/&#945;p53 cells arrested in G1 despite the absence of p53 protein.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4eda0047-ba13-45d8-9238-553d11c8c18d\/@w03B8ZSB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 Cell cycle checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Checkpoint,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17831"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Megan Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Aime A.

These kinases collaborate in activating the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) at the kinetochore (KT) to regulate chromosome alignment and segregation prior to mitotic exit. In vitro, BAL0891 has a combined prolonged effect on TTK and a transient effect on PLK1, leading to rapid disruption of the SAC that potentiates aberrant mitotic progression of tumor cells. In this work, efficacy of BAL0891 was investigated in mouse models of human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) including evaluation of dose-dependency, drug exposure, target occupancy and a screen of activity across a panel of PDX models.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The MDA-MB-231 cell line was grown sc in nude mice and treated with BAL0891, administered IV weekly (QW) or twice-weekly (2QW). Thirteen sc TNBC PDX models were screened for BAL0891 response using 2QW administration. Efficacy was quantified as deltaT\/C (treated\/control tumors). Plasma and tumor were analyzed for drug levels or TTK target occupancy by LC-MS\/MS. The latter used a biotinylated TTK-specific probe and streptavidin-mediated isolation of unoccupied TTK, trypsin digestion and quantification of TTK-representative peptides.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> BAL0891 efficacy was tested in the TNBC xenograft model MDA-MB-231 with QW or 2QW IV dosing schedules. All treatments were well tolerated, with no drug-related animal deaths. With MTD dosing, tumor regressions were observed, while different MTD fractions for both QW and 2QW schedules showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activity. The weekly MTD group was followed for an additional 20 days after treatment cessation on day 100. Strikingly, 3 of 8 tumors continued to shrink resulting in 2 (25%) pathologically confirmed cures. Consistent with the potent efficacy of intermittent MTD dosing, and prolonged tumor drug exposure, tumor TTK was fully drug-occupied for &#8805; 6 days after the last administration; target occupancy was also dose-and drug exposure-dependent. To further evaluate BAL0891 anti-cancer activity in TNBC, a screen in 13 TNBC PDX models was conducted. Seven models exhibited deltaT\/C &#60; 50%, with regressions observed in 3. Of these, 2 models showed persistent regressions &#8805; 70% vs. baseline. Interestingly, evaluation of TTK target occupancy in selected models showed high target occupancy independent of tumor response, indicating target dependency rather than drug availability is important for anti-cancer activity.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> BAL0891 is a novel dual TTK\/PLK1 mitotic checkpoint inhibitor with potent anti-cancer activity in TNBC models. Intermittent IV administration is well tolerated and associated with prolonged tumor drug exposure, prolonged TTK inhibition and notable anti-tumor efficacy. These data support further investigation of BAL0891 for the treatment of cancer patients (incl.

In this work, kinase inhibition by BAL0891 was linked to effects on SAC integrity and aberrant mitotic progression in tumor cells. Comparison with a TTK-specific inhibitor (CFI-402257, CFI) allowed further evaluation of the contribution of dual TTK\/PLK1 inhibition to anti-cancer activity, associated with a promising anti-proliferative profile across diverse tumor cell lines.<br \/><b>Me<\/b><b>thods:<\/b> Kinase assays used a radiometric assay. Target residency was measured using surface plasmon resonance with recombinant kinase. Anti-proliferative activity was assessed with crystal violet or YO-PRO assay (5 days incubation), in-cell target inhibition by immunoblotting for phospho-TTK following drug wash-out. Effects on SAC integrity were followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) mitotic progression by flow cytometry\/mitotic marker expression. Cells were blocked in mitosis using the microtubule-targeting agent nocodazole or the PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib. SAC KT accumulation was evaluated by immunofluorescence (IF) for co-localization of BubR1 with CENPC. Comparative studies with CFI used anti-proliferative IC50 concentrations.<br \/><b>Results<\/b><b>:<\/b> In vitro kinase profiling showed that BAL0891 has low nM IC50s against TTK and PLK1, with prolonged TTK (&#62;12 h) and transient PLK1 (4 min) target residency. Prolonged TTK inhibition (&#8805;38 h) was also observed in HT29 tumor cells. Consistent with a dominant TTK-targeting activity, BAL0891 treatment of HT29 cells blocked in mitosis with nocodazole or the PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib led to aberrant mitotic release and accumulation of polyploid cells. This was preceded by SAC disruption as visualized by IP assays. Effects on the SAC and mitotic exit were evaluated in comparative studies with CFI; BAL0891 exhibited faster kinetics for both parameters suggesting a contribution of PLK1 inhibition. This was confirmed by directly evaluating acute effects on SAC integrity at the KT by IF. Specifically, 1 h BAL0891 treatment of mitotic HT29 cells resulted in a highly reproducible and significant reduction in KT-associated SAC (p&#60;0.0001) which was not observed with CFI in the same conditions.

Despite advanced treatment, the cancer recurs frequently. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (<i>PTEN<\/i>) is a tumor suppressor gene whose mutations have been found to be one of the most frequent events in GBM. PTEN acts as a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. GBM transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a positive enrichment of cell cycle and PI3K pathway. Moreover, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on TCGA GBMLGG cohort revealed a cell cycle-related module (&#8216;cell-cycle&#8217; module), which was shown to be positively correlated with PTEN mutation status. This &#8216;cell-cycle&#8217; module also showed a positive correlation with glioma aggressiveness.We then utilized a<i> <\/i>nestin-cre;<i>Pten<\/i>-fl\/fl<i> <\/i>mouse model to investigate the consequences of PTEN loss that may be involved in GBM. Based on our preliminary data, transcriptomic profiling of primary astrocytes derived from <i>Pten<\/i> knockout mice revealed an overlapping enrichment of cell cycle related pathways with human GBM. Four cell cycle genes, <i>RCC1<\/i>, <i>RCC2<\/i>, <i>NEK2<\/i>, and <i>CHK2<\/i>, were validated to be significantly upregulated in <i>Pten<\/i>-null astrocytes by qRT-PCR. Regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1) and Regulator of chromatin condensation 2 (RCC2) both belong to the RCC1 family. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that both RCC1 and RCC2 are involved in tumorigenesis of multiple cancers and cell cycle progression. By siRNA inhibition, we demonstrated that silencing of either RCC1 or RCC2 in glioblastoma cell lines suppresses GBM cell growth. Moreover, we found that RCC2 is essential for both G1-S and G2-M transition. Additionally, RCC2 silencing and a PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibit glioblastoma cell viability in a synergistic manner. In summary, PTEN deficiency leads to the alteration of cell cycle progression, which may promote tumorigenesis of glioblastoma. RCC1 and RCC2 have been demonstrated to be potential targets regulated by PTEN and affects cell viability. RCC2 was shown to be a key regulator of cell cycle progression. To further explore the RCC1 and RCC2 roles, we will find the potential downstream target of RCC1 and RCC2 and its potential therapeutic effect <i>in vivo<\/i>.

However, the emergence of secondary mutations results in clinical resistance to available TKIs. GIST progression is driven by genomic events which incrementally target the p16-CDK4\/6-RB1 and p14-TP53-RB1 pathways to create CDK4\/6 and CDK2 oncogenic co-dependency. Based on limited efficacy of single-agent CDK4\/6-inhibitor (CDK4\/6i) therapy in GIST, we evaluated strategies of co-targeting CDK2 and CDK4\/6. Multiplexed protein imaging (via Immuno-SABER) was validated for the detection of cell cycle regulator aberrations in GIST clinical samples (N=18), 7 of which were TKI-resistant, and including 3 patients in whom multiple metastases were analyzed. The impact of various CDK perturbants using CDK2i (CDK2 inhibitor-II), CDK4\/6i (palbociclib or abemaciclib), and CDK2\/4\/6i (PF-06873600) was determined through cell proliferation and protein detection assays in GIST cell lines and murine xenografts. Mechanisms of acquired CDK2i and CDK4\/6i resistance were characterized in GIST cell lines after long-term exposure. Abnormal expression\/biallelic inactivation of <i>CDKN2A<\/i>\/p16, RB1, and TP53 were identified in 7 (39%), 2 (11%), and 2 (11%) of 18 GISTs, respectively. Identical aberrations of p16, RB1, and TP53 were present in all metastases from 3 patients. Since 5 of 7 RB1-intact advanced GISTs had co-dysregulation of the CDK2 and CDK4\/6 pathways, we evaluated co-inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4\/6 <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> which inhibited cell proliferation (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.01) and RB1 hyperphosphorylation. Intact RB1 predicted response to treatment, whereas RB1-deficient models were resistant. Two resistant sub-lines emerged after 11 and 14 months of palbociclib exposure: one with biallelic genomic <i>RB1<\/i> inactivation and the other with the first known example of a cyclin D1 coding sequence fusion with oncogenic properties (<i>CCND<\/i><i>1::<\/i><i>chr11.g:70025223<\/i>). The <i>CCND1<\/i> fusion deleted the cyclin D1 C-terminal Thr286 and Thr288 residues which mediate cyclin D1 proteasomal degradation, resulting in overexpression of an abnormal cyclin D1. Palbociclib-resistance properties were corroborated by lentiviral transduction of the <i>CCND1<\/i> fusion gene into fusion-negative GIST, leiomyosarcoma, and breast cancer cells. CDK2 and CDK4\/6 pathway perturbations with retained RB1 are frequent in advanced GIST and can be conserved across metastases, creating a compelling biologic rationale for therapeutic cell cycle restoration. We show that co-inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4\/6 is synergistic in GIST and highlight <i>RB1<\/i> inactivation and a novel oncogenic cyclin D1 as mechanisms of acquired CDKi resistance. Hence, combination therapies targeting CDK2 and CDK4\/6 with correlative biomarkers predictive of response should be evaluated in patients with metastatic or TKI-resistant GIST.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2497099c-7c80-4960-86cc-6959e0dd2a47\/@w03B8ZSB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,Cell cycle,GIST,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18774"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Inga-Marie Schaefer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meijun Z.

Our previous work identified CDK6 overexpression as a critical determinant of acquired resistance to CDK4\/6i. Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT) play important roles in regulating the expression of oncogenes in multiple cancer types. BET inhibitors (BETi), such as JQ1, have been extensively studied for the treatment of cancers. It has been shown that BRD4 is recruited to the CDK6 gene promoter and that BET inhibition reduces CDK6 mRNA and protein expression. In this study, we investigated the potential of BET inhibition to reverse CDK4\/6i resistance of ER+ breast cancer.<br \/>Methods: By long-term exposure to increasing concentrations of a CDK4\/6i, we developed MCF7 and T47D ER+ breast cancer cell lines with acquired resistance to several FDA-approved CDK4\/6 inhibitors demonstrating marked CDK6 overexpression. Cell viability and survival assays were performed to assess the in vitro efficacy of BETi. Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate cell cycle alterations as well as cell death. Gene expression was analyzed by Western blotting and qPCR to examine cell cycle-related molecular changes. Markers of apoptosis were also evaluated by Western blotting. CDK4\/6i-resistant ER+ tumors were established in immunodeficient mouse models to explore the in vivo efficacy of BETi.<br \/>Results: Our data showed that JQ1 significantly reduced cell viability and survival of CDK4\/6i-resistant ER+ breast cancer cells in the presence of palbociclib, a commonly used CDK4\/6i for the treatment of metastatic ER+ HER2- breast cancer. JQ1 also induced marked G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CDK4\/6 inhibitor-resistant MCF7 and T47D cell lines in a time and dose-dependent manner. Analyses of key molecular mediators of cell cycle progression identified CDK6 and cyclin D1 as the major targets of JQ1 in CDK4\/6i-resistant cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that JQ1 suppressed CDK6 expression at the mRNA level. Importantly, we determined that growth suppression and killing of CDK4\/6i-resistant cells by BETi were largely the consequence of CDK6 downregulation by BET inhibition. We have also established CDK4\/6i-resistant xenografts successfully from MCF7 cells to test the in vivo efficacy of BETi in reversing CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistance.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results suggest that BET inhibition has potent efficacy in reversing acquired CDK4\/6i resistance of ER+ breast cancer, mainly through its inhibitory regulation of CDK6. BET inhibitors are therefore promising candidate therapeutic agents for the treatment of CDK4\/6i-resistant ER+ breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/51076511-73db-44a9-9c14-f8f529710ba1\/@w03B8ZSB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BET inhibitors,Breast cancer,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18775"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Renyan Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Constantia Pantelidou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heta Jadhav<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geoffrey Shapiro<\/i><\/presenter>.

RP-6306 is a highly potent PKMYT1 inhibitor that displays single digit nM potency in an in vitro enzyme assay. RP-6306 dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of CDK1 on Thr14 in HCC1569 cells and had no impact on the Tyr15 phospho-site of CDK1 that is regulated by family member Wee1. Cell-based assays showed increased phosphorylation of replication stress and pre-mitotic entry biomarkers in RP-6306 treated HCC1569 cells. Micronuclei and Caspase-3 were detected in a dose-dependent manner in HCC1569 cells treated with RP-6306 indicating the onset of genomic instability and apoptosis in these cells. Growth assays confirmed irreparable damage and proliferation defects in cells treated with RP-6306. Experiments to evaluate the combination of RP-6306 with gemcitabine, an S-phase specific pyrimidine analog that inhibits DNA synthesis showed profound synergistic growth defects in HCC1569 cells. In vivo, RP-6306 inhibition of Thr14 phosphorylation of CDK1 in HCC1569 tumors was directly proportional to free circulating plasma levels and resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth in a dose and time dependent manner. In combination with gemcitabine, RP-6306 demonstrated tumor regression and superior efficacy compared to single agent treatment of either agent alone in multiple <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplified models, including HCC1569 and OVCAR3. Our studies show that inhibition of PKMYT1 kinase activity impairs the growth of <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplified cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo and stands to benefit cancer patients with <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification. A Phase I clinical trial (NCT04855656- Mythic Study) is currently underway to evaluate RP-6306 in patients with advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2e46556-558e-4506-a06d-eff2f873bb97\/@w03B8ZSB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 Cell cycle checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle checkpoints,PKMYT1,CCNE1,Replication Stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18776"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jimmy Fourtounis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Martino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rino Stocco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prasamit Baruah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Duffy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Gallo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Fournier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>JingJing Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elia Aguado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Petrone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Roulston<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yael Mamane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Morris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janek Szychowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Papp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mike Zinda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>C.
