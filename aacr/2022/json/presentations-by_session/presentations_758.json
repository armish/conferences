[{"Abstract":"CD70 is highly expressed on renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with limited normal tissue expression, making it an attractive CAR T target for an immunogenic solid tumor indication. Here we generated and characterized a panel of anti-CD70 scFv-based CAR T cells. Despite the expression of CD70 on T cells, production of CAR T from a subset of scFvs with potent <i>in vitro<\/i> activity was achieved. Expression of CD70 CARs was found to mask CD70 detection in cis and provide protection from CD70 CAR T-mediated fratricide. Two unique classes of CAR T cells were identified with differing memory phenotype, activation status, and cytotoxic activity. Epitope mapping revealed CARs binding to the membrane distal region of the CD70 extracellular domain (ECD) fall into the more active and differentiated class, as compared to CARs binding the membrane proximal region of the CD70 ECD. CD70 CAR T cells were evaluated with rituximab-based off switches to provide control over CAR T function and displayed robust antitumor activity against RCC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts in mouse models. Tissue cross reactivity studies to evaluate off-target binding with two lead CARs showed membrane staining in rare tissue-resident lymphocytes, thus matching the known expression pattern of CD70. Expected findings related to T cell activation, and elimination of CD70-expressing cells were observed in a cynomolgus monkey CD3-CD70 bispecific toxicity study and included cytokine release and loss of cellularity in lymphoid tissues. Lastly, highly functional CD70 allogeneic CAR T cells were produced at large scale through elimination of the T cell receptor by TALEN&#174; gene editing. Taken together, these efficacy and safety data support the evaluation of CD70 CAR T cells for the treatment of RCC and led to the advancement of an allogeneic CD70 CAR T candidate into Phase I clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f96f973-29d7-4f9e-a308-e88b51b5662c\/@y03B8ZXs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD70,Chimeric antigen receptor,Renal cell carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Siler Panowski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Surabhi Srinivasan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nguyen Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Tacheva-Grigorova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yvonne Mak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongxiu Ning<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Villanueva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dinali Wijewarnasuriya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shanshan Lang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zea Melton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adit Ghosh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathilde Dusseaux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roman Galetto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Heyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Sai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Van Blarcom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javier Chaparro-Riggers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbra Sasu<\/i><\/presenter>.

We recently described the identification of a tumor reactive natural killer (NK) cell population by its in vivo upregulation of PD-L1 in the presence of tumor, referred to here as TRACK-NK cells. PD-L1(+) NK cells are more potent than PD-L1(-) NK cells against tumor cell targets. Further, the administration of anti-PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab) functions as an immune agonist on TRACK-NK cells resulting in significantly enhanced degranulation (<i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.001) and secretion of IFN-gamma (<i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.001) in the presence of tumor. Here we investigated the functional activity and product safety of allogeneic, off-the-shelf TRACK-NK cells retrovirally transduced to express soluble (s) IL-15 to treat NSCLC without or with the addition of atezolizumab. TRACK-NK cells derived from umbilical cord blood NK cells were expanded over 1,000-fold <i>ex-vivo<\/i> in 17 days with ~50% of the final product engineered to express sIL15 and cytokine-activated to express PD-L1. The phenotype of the final TRACK-NK cell product showed a significant increase in the expression of PD-L1, CD25 and CD69 when compared to non-transduced (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01) or NK cells transduced to express sIL15 without cytokine activation (s15 NK cells) (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01). Following cryopreservation, our thawed TRACK-NK cell product demonstrated high recovery (&#62;85%) and viability (&#62;80%). In a <u>R<\/u>eal <u>T<\/u>ime <u>C<\/u>ell <u>A<\/u>nalysis (RTCA) <i>in vitro <\/i>cytotoxicity assay against a human NSCLC cell line (A549), TRACK-NK cells were 10 times more potent than non-transduced (NT) NK cells (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001) and 2 times more potent than s15 NK cells (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01). To assess the efficacy of our frozen, allogeneic off-the-shelf TRACK-NK cells <i>in vivo<\/i>, we utilized immunodeficient mice bearing human A549 metastatic NSCLC. Intravenous infusion of TRACK-NK cells resulted in significantly more suppression of luciferase-A549 NSCLC growth in mice compared to mice treated with NT NK<br \/>cells (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05) or s15 NK cells (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01). In terms of dose response, 1 &#215; 10<sup>7<\/sup> TRACK-NK cells per dose delivered every other day for a total of 4 doses showed significantly better tumor control compared to a dose of 5 &#215; 10<sup>6<\/sup> TRACK-NK cells (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001) but similar control compared to 2 &#215; 10<sup>7<\/sup> TRACK-NK cells. The combination of<i> <\/i>TRACK-NK cells plus atezolizumab showed better control of NSCLC growth <i>in vivo <\/i>compared to TRACK-NK cells alone (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01). Finally, we evaluated the safety of our TRACK-NK product in immunodeficient mice without tumor engraftment and did not observe any significant change in body weight, body temperature, liver enzymes, kidney function, or blood counts compared to mice treated with vehicle control. No cytokine release syndrome was observed. In summary, our studies using human allogeneic off-the-shelf TRACK-NK cells proved to be safe and non-toxic, demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity against NSCLC <i>in vitro<\/i> and enhanced control of tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>, further improved with atezolizumab. As the intravenous infusion of activated NK cells naturally traffic to lung, our TRACK-NK platform will move forward to the clinic for the treatment of relapsed and refractory NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/00b84d92-9c1c-4c3b-96be-fb61dedfa6ae\/@y03B8ZXs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Immunotherapy,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ting Lu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony G.

To this end, we genetically engineered TIL to express membrane-bound IL-15 (mbIL15) under the control of Obsidian&#8217;s cytoDRIVE&#174; technology (cytoTIL15<sup>TM<\/sup>), which allows regulation of protein expression via a drug-responsive domain upon acetazolamide (ACZ) administration. IL-15 is a preferred cytokine over IL-2 to mediate TIL activation and expansion, because it does not result in CD8 T cell exhaustion or stimulate regulatory CD4 T cells, and enhances development of a memory T-cell phenotype. We have previously demonstrated IL-2-independent, 3-6-fold increased cytoTIL15 persistence in an antigen-independent setting relative to unengineered TIL therapy with IL-2 (uTIL) (2). Due to the challenge of generating autologous tumor\/TIL-matched pairs and most importantly, to assess cytoTIL15 cell&#8217;s functional impact on anti-tumor growth across multiple donors, we developed an allogeneic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. To establish the model, different melanoma tumor digests were co-incubated <i>in vitro<\/i> with select HLA-A*02-matched, allogeneic melanoma TIL donors to assess their reactivity. Tumors were screened for expression of shared antigens, such as gp100 and MART1, and TIL donor TCRs were screened with tetramers. Once established, serially passaged tumor fragments were grown, measured, and randomized into groups to receive intravenous transfer of TIL (n=8\/cohort). Mice receiving uTIL were treated with four saturating doses of recombinant IL-2, and mice receiving cytoTIL15 cells received either vehicle or oral 200 mg\/kg ACZ daily for the entire study, without any IL-2. Three of four cytoTIL15 cell preparations from different donors dosed with ACZ achieved significant tumor growth inhibition compared to uTIL. Four mice developed complete responses as early as 17 days post cytoTIL15 cell transfer. The level of anti-tumor response was associated with increased frequency of MART1-reactive cytoTIL15 cells. On day 20 after TIL transfer, tumors and secondary lymphoid organs were collected (n=4\/cohort). Tumors treated with cytoTIL15 cells + ACZ showed an 8-10-fold increased TIL infiltration compared to uTIL or cytoTIL15 cells + vehicle. Moreover, enhanced cytoTIL15 cell infiltration and anti-tumor activity was associated with increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN&#947;). Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate the superiority of cytoTIL15 cells over uTIL for controlling or eradicating melanoma tumor outgrowth and the utility of an allogeneic PDX model for comparative evaluation of tumor-antigen specific TIL reactivity.<br \/><b>References:<\/b> 1.

Despite multi-modal aggressive therapies, relapsed, refractory or metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma remains a lethal disease with no significant improvement in outcome over decades of clinical trials. Therefore novel<i> <\/i>therapies are needed. FGFR4 is a developmentally regulated cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in RMS when compared with normal tissues, and mutationally activated in about 7.5% of RMS. Recently we showed that PAX3-FOXO1 establishes a super-enhancer in the FGFR4 genomic locus driving its high expression in fusion positive RMS. CAR T-cell therapy is effective in treating refractory and relapsed B-cell leukemia and lymphoma, with three CARs targeting CD19 approved by the FDA. Multiple CART trials are currently underway for solid tumors. Since FGFR4 is a cell surface protein, we hypothesized that FGFR4 will provide a rational target for immunotherapy in RMS. We confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining, western analysis, and Meso Scale Discovery that FGFR4 protein is highly differentially expressed in RMS samples. We developed a murine anti-FGFR4 antibody, 3A11, by immunizing mouse with FGFR4-IG fusion protein. 3A11 showed high affinity and specificity of binding to FGFR4. We then developed a second-generation CAR using the V<sub>L<\/sub> and V<sub>H<\/sub> domain of 3A11 antibody and found that the scFvFc retained its specificity and high affinity at nanomolar range. Human T cells transduced with 3A11 CAR construct were found to be highly potent at inducing IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945;, IL-2 and cytotoxicity when the FGFR4-CART was co-cultured with RMS cells, but not with RMS cells with FGFR4 knocked out or FGFR4 negative cells. 3A11 CART incubated with human primary cells obtained from liver, kidney, heart, and pancreas, did not elicit a cytokine response, indicating a low potential for &#8220;on-target off-tumor&#8221; toxicity. <i>In vivo<\/i> testing also found that 3A11 CART eliminated RMS cells in both murine xenograft metastatic and localized subcutaneous models.

However, its application has been limited due to severe toxicities associated with its high concentration administration. These side effects are attributed to the strong binding of IL2 to its receptor IL2R&#945; which is enriched on regulatory T Cells and Lung epithelial cells. We have engineered IL2 to significantly reduce IL2R&#945; binding and enhance IL2R&#946; binding. We further developed EPIM-001, a bi-functional IL2R&#946; agonist and Anti-PDL1 biologic, aiming to treat a broad set of solid tumors with improved therapeutic index.<br \/>Methods: We used mSCAFold<sup>TM<\/sup>, a unique protein engineering platform to redefine and improve pharmacologic properties of the cytokine through structure-based rationally designed libraries and mRNA display selection. The optimal IL2 candidate with enhanced IL2R&#946; and reduced IL2R&#945; binding was engineered with an internally discovered anti-PD-L1 antibody to generate EPIM-001, a bispecific IL2\/PD-L1 biologic drug candidate. EPIM-001 was characterized <i>in vitro<\/i> for receptor binding activity, immune cell activation, proliferation, and tumor cell killing assays. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy was evaluated in xenograft humanized mouse models, and PK\/PD and toxicity has been studied in Non-Human Primates (NHPs).<br \/>Results: We have shown that EPIM-001 is a strong agonist of IL2R&#946;, with significantly reduced binding to IL2R&#945;. It demonstrated much stronger CD8+ T cells and NK cell activation and proliferation compared WT-IL2, whilst only weaker activation and minimal proliferation with Tregs. <i>In vitro<\/i> cell killing assays showed that EPIM-001 promoted better immune cell killing of PD-L1 expressing target cells than WT IL2. In xenograft <i>in vivo<\/i> studies, EPIM-001 has shown significant tumor growth inhibition against the human lung cancer cell line H1975, which whilst expressing high levels of PD-L1, does not respond to PD-L1\/PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, EPIM-001 showed stronger tumor growth inhibition compared to Keytruda. PK\/PD and toxicity studies in NHPs showed that EPIM-001 is well tolerated. EPIM-001 greatly expanded CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, whilst having minimal effect on TRegs and Eosinophils associated with toxicity.<br \/>Conclusions: EPIM-001 is a promising immune modulating drug candidate that selectively activates CD8+ T cells and NK Cells with strong anti-tumor activity and safe profile for both immune checkpoint sensitive and insensitive PD-L1 positive tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a64cd2a0-1b04-4dee-a4e0-6bcb1f1a0cd8\/@y03B8ZXs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,Anti-PD-L1,Bispecific antibody,Immune modulator,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kehao Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Hassan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenna Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ning Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gening Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Feng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 (ILT3, also known as <i>LILRB4<\/i>) is highly expressed on tumor-associated myeloid cells and promotes their suppressive phenotype. Our team recently identified fibronectin as a functional ligand for ILT3. The fibronectin-ILT3 interaction serves as a &#8220;stromal checkpoint&#8221; through which the extracellular matrix actively promotes myeloid cell suppression in the tumor microenvironment. We now report the pre-clinical characterization of NGM831, a humanized IgG1 (N297G) antibody that binds to ILT3 of human and cynomolgus monkey origin with high specificity and sub-nM affinity and blocks the interaction of ILT3 with both its reported ligands, fibronectin and ApoE. In a gene expression profiling experiment, treatment of tolerogenic dendritic cells with NGM831 in the presence of fibronectin decreased their expression of inhibitory and scavenger receptors (<i>CD163<\/i>, <i>MRC1<\/i>, <i>MARCO<\/i>, <i>STAB1<\/i>, <i>LILRB2<\/i>) and markers of dendritic cell immaturity (<i>CD14<\/i>, <i>CD209<\/i>, <i>FOLR2<\/i>) and increased their expression of genes involved in antigen presentation (<i>TNFSF14<\/i>, <i>DCSTAMP<\/i>, <i>CD82<\/i>, <i>OLR1<\/i>) and TH1 polarization (<i>SPP1<\/i>, <i>TBX21<\/i>), suggesting that these cells had been remodeled to a more stimulatory phenotype. Consistent with these observations, treatment of tolerogenic dendritic cells with NGM831 increased their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to Fc&#611;R ligation, restored their responsiveness to maturation stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CD40 ligand (CD40L), and increased their production of chemokines that could induce the migration of other immune cells to sites of inflammation. In addition, NGM831 acted synergistically with pembrolizumab to increase the ability of dendritic cells to stimulate allogeneic T cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that NGM831 can block fibronectin-mediated immunosuppression and promote myeloid cell reprogramming. These data support the clinical development of the ILT3 antagonist antibody NGM831 alone and in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. NGM831 is expected to enter clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors in early 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/32368c7a-c9c7-4665-972e-0cfb2ea52727\/@y03B8ZXs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Cancer immunotherapy,Therapeutic target,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Peirong Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne C.

When T cells infiltrate the tumor microenvironment (TME), they encounter hypoxia and, in this condition, cells upregulate an evolutionary conserved Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription factor to adapt to the hypoxic stress. Hypoxia has been reported to alter specific aspects of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell biology through various mechanisms but in large part by the HIF1-&#945;, leading to immune suppression. Therefore, identification and development of drugs that target hypoxia is critical to augment immune cells' function and enhance the anti-tumor response of immunotherapy. Over the past decades, several cellular and pre-clinical studies have shown that ascorbic acid (AA) possesses anti-tumor properties and acts as an adjuvant to various cancer therapies. AA, as a proven redox potential modulator, has proved to also be effective in targeting oxygen sensing regulator (reducing Hif1-&#945; levels) and epigenetic reprogramming (increasing ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase enzymatic activity) in cancer cells. Most recently, immunomodulating potential of AA has been recognized as it enhanced the efficacy of checkpoint blockade by increasing immune cell infiltration within the TME. However, the exact mechanisms by which AA exerts immunotherapeutic effects in cancer have not been fully understood. Here, we hypothesized that AA exerts its immunotherapeutic effects by targeting tumor-induced hypoxic stress in CD8 T cells. Indeed, we found that AA induces a robust anti-tumor response by decreasing tumor volume and increasing mice survival. Immune profiling in the TME revealed that AA increases the infiltration of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells with enhanced cytotoxic cytokine production and proliferation. To further evaluate the underlying mechanism, we challenged CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells with a cognate antigen ex vivo under the hypoxic\/normoxic conditions. We found that hypoxia negatively affected the effector functions and proliferation of CD8 T cells. Interestingly, AA could reverse these effects, bringing the function and proliferation of cells back to the normoxic level by increasing the expression of Granzyme B, Interferon gamma and Ki-67. This reversal of hypoxia-induced adverse effects on CD8 T cells was achieved by AA-mediated decrease in the Hif1-&#945; levels (a hypoxia mediator) and increase in TET-2 protein expression and function (characterized by increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmc) levels). Moreover, AA treatment could significantly enhance the metabolic fitness of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (characterized by improved glycolytic ability and mitochondrial function) that were exposed to severe hypoxia. In conclusion, our data indicate that AA treatment shows enhanced anti-tumor effects via restoring cytotoxic T cell functions under hypoxic TME. These results also provide new insights into the immunomodulatory effects of AA via targeting hypoxia in CD8 T cells. Given that hypoxia in the TME is a barrier for generation of effective immune response, our results suggest that AA treatment is an effective strategy against cancer and may further enhance the anti-tumor effects of immunotherapeutic agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a327505-35dc-48ec-a95c-25daf0b50b72\/@z03B8ZXt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Ascorbic acid,CD8 T cells,Hypoxia-inducible factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nazli Jafarzadeh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pankaj Gaur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dareen Sarhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nour Shobaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wael Traboulsi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zainab Ramlaoui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivek Verma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seema Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samir N.

Nevertheless, its pleiotropic effect has led to prohibitory side effects and immune restraint. In contrast, the PD-1 blockade-based cancer immunotherapy has a good safety profile by targeting and sustaining the activity of tumor-antigen specific T cells within cancer tissues. To take full advantage of complementary antitumor activity of PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and IL-2 as well as supreme intratumoral T-cell-targeting property of PD-1, a bifunctional fusion protein composed of PD-1 mAb and IL-2 mutein (&#945;PD-1-IL-2c) is designed. IL-2c is a chimeric molecule that contains a fragment from IL-15 and does not bind to IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R&#945;). &#945;PD-1-IL-2c stimulated greater pSTAT5 activation and proliferation in PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells than PD-1<sup>-<\/sup> T cells. &#945;PD-1-IL-2c also induced a much stronger anti-tumor immune response compared to PD-1 mAb, IL-2c, or PD-1 mAb in combination with IL-2c in multiple syngeneic models such as B16F10, CT26, and MC38. In CT26 and MC38 models, &#945;PD-1-IL-2c achieved complete response starting from 0.3 mg\/kg dosing. In B16F10 model, &#945;PD-1-IL-2c showed greater than 70% tumor growth inhibition (TGI). Global gene expression profiling studies showed that PD-1-IL-2c treatment significantly elevated expression levels of <i>Cd3d, Cd3e, Cd8a, Il2r&#945;,<\/i> <i>Cxcr3<\/i>, <i>Cxcr6, Zap70, Lck, and Pdcd1<\/i> in tumor tissues compared to treatment with PD-1 mAbs or IL-2c, indicating a specific expansion and activation of T cell in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The safety profile of &#945;PD-1-IL-2c was assessed and compared to WT IL-2 and a leading &#8220;No-&#945;&#8221; &#945;PD-1-IL-2 fusion protein &#173;(&#945;PD-1-IL-2x). WT IL-2 and &#945;PD-1-IL-2x induced significant body weight loss and severe splenomegaly when dosed at 1.25 mg\/kg. In contrast, &#945;PD-1-IL-2c dosed at 10 mg\/kg did not cause appreciable body weight loss and only led to minimal splenomegaly. In summary, we have developed a safe and highly potent &#945;PD-1-IL-2 mutein that achieves full PD-1 blockade and TME-specific T cell activation and expansion without appreciable toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e0dc3787-9b51-4bb0-97d5-dafacd27711a\/@z03B8ZXt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,PD-1,Cytokines,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fan Ye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianing Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoey Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Liao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ella Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison Quach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenny Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanna Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hua<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Savannah Yung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lili Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ziyang Zhong<\/i><\/presenter>.

Emerging research suggests that effective anti-tumor immunity and responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy, may be subverted by the presence of collagen and tumor stroma. LAIR1 functions as an inhibitory receptor for collagen, and is highly expressed on tumor-associated macrophages, and to an extent on T cells. LAIR1 expression correlates with poor overall survival and CPI therapy resistance. To test the hypothesis that LAIR1 mediates tumor stroma-driven immune suppression and promotes CPI resistance, we generated NGM438, a monoclonal mAb to antagonize LAIR1 activity in solid cancers. Herein, we describe NGM438, characterize LAIR1 expression and distribution in human tumors, and provide evidence that LAIR1 antagonism reverses collagen-driven immune suppression and improves CPI responsiveness in immune cell-based assays and preclinical animal models.<br \/>Methods: NGM438 was identified and developed based on its ability to bind specifically to LAIR1, antagonize ligand binding, and reverse collagen-based immune suppression. NGM438 was tested using several immune cell-based functional assays, alone and in combination with the anti-PD1 mAb, pembrolizumab. Expression and distribution of LAIR1 was evaluated using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry on healthy donor and cancer patient samples. A surrogate anti-mouse LAIR1 antagonist mAb was also developed and evaluated in preclinical animal models in combination with anti-PD1 mAbs.<br \/>Results: NGM438 reversed collagen-induced immune suppression in myeloid cells and promoted anti-PD1 mAb-driven T cell responses in immune cell-based functional assays. LAIR1 was expressed on circulating immune cells from cancer patients actively receiving CPI therapy, and was elevated on patient-matched intratumoral macrophages. Histological assessments revealed LAIR1 expression on mononuclear immune cells that infiltrated the parenchyma and collagen-rich tumor stroma across indications. Finally, LAIR1 antagonism, in combination with anti-PD1 mAb treatment, led to significant tumor growth inhibition in a preclinical model resistant to either treatment alone.<br \/>Conclusions: NGM438 is a novel LAIR1 antagonist mAb that reverses collagen-based immune suppression. LAIR1 was expressed on cancer patient circulating and intratumoral immune cells, and LAIR1-expressing cells were often found in collagen-rich tumor stroma. Preclinical data demonstrated that LAIR1 antagonism sensitized a resistant mouse tumor model to respond to anti-PD1 mAb treatment. These data support clinical evaluation of LAIR1 antagonist mAb NGM438. We aim to test the hypothesis that LAIR1 mediates collagen-driven immune suppression, alone and in combination with PD1 inhibition, in patients with solid cancers. As such, we will be advancing NGM438 to the clinic in early 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d15e6ada-ac15-4857-a163-6119dd0e9709\/@z03B8ZXt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Cancer immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sisi He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiawei Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leticia Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Czrina Cortez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Betty Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmence Ho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amir Ashique<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kalyani Mondal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vicky Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie Roda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bin Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Mikaelian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Sissons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee Rivera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Don Gibbons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jonathan Sitrin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

OX40 activation has been explored as a potential treatment for solid malignancies, using mainly agonistic anti-OX40 antibodies. These antibodies rely on Fc gamma receptor (Fc&#947;R)-mediated crosslinking to activate the OX40 pathway and have shown so far only limited antitumoral efficacy in clinical settings. One underlying hypothesis is that Fc&#947;R crosslinking of these antibodies may not allow optimal activation of the OX40 pathway to fully exploit the potential of this target for immunotherapy of cancer. To overcome this limitation, we designed PRS-352\/S095025, a strong PD-L1-dependent OX40 agonistic bispecific molecule, that allows combination of OX40 costimulation and PD-L1 blockade.<br \/>Methods: We generated an Anticalin protein that binds with high affinity to human OX40. Anticalin&#174; proteins are approximately 18-20 kDa protein therapeutics derived from human lipocalins that can be engineered to bind with high affinity and specificity to different targets. The PRS-352\/S095025 bispecific fusion protein was obtained by genetic fusion of OX40-targeting Anticalin protein to a PD-L1-targeting monoclonal antibody with a modified IgG4 backbone, allowing an optimal activation of OX40 in the presence of PD-L1, but not Fc&#947;Rs.<br \/>Results: We showed that PRS-352\/S095025 retains binding to PD-L1 like the anti PD-L1 antibody backbone alone and binds with high affinity to both human and cynomolgus OX40. We showed that PRS-352\/S095025 inhibited the PD-1\/ PD-L1 pathway, as the parental PD-L1 targeting antibody and an approved anti PD-L1 antibody. In addition to its PD-L1 blocking properties, we showed that PRS-352\/S095025 activates OX40, and that this activity is dependent on the expression of PD-L1 and not on Fc&#947;R, consistent with the desired mechanism of action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PRS-352\/S095025 activity is superior to both PD-L1 benchmark antibodies and to the combination of clinically relevant OX40 and PD-L1 benchmark antibodies. We could also show that PRS352\/S095025 strongly stimulated human CD4 T cells. In vivo, we showed that PRS-352\/S095025 has a PK profile similar to that of the PD-L1 antibody alone.<br \/>Conclusions: We provide here the preclinical characterization of the fusion protein PRS-352\/S095025, a bispecific molecule composed of a PD-L1 blocking moiety and an Anticalin protein agonizing OX40. In vitro, this molecule showed the desired MoA, PD-L1 blocking and potent OX40 agonism driven by binding to PD-L1, with superior activity to a clinical stage OX40 agonist.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7bbaf76b-e95b-4a52-8277-a0001a839e5b\/@z03B8ZXt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"OX40,PD-L1,Bispecific antibody,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lucia Pattarini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Pavlidou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aizea Kastresana Morales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janet Peper-Gabriel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthieu Riviere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Didier Demarles<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alix Scholer-Dahirel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronique Blanc<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shane Olwill<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have previously reported that Bi-Sialidase - an engineered human sialidase-Fc fusion - potentiates antitumor immune response by cleaving terminal sialic acids from sialoglycans (desialylating) on tumor cells and immune cells. Furthermore, we have shown that a tumor-targeted sialidase, a heterodimeric molecule consisting of one chain of sialidase-Fc and a second chain of a HER2-targeting antibody (trastuzumab), leads to more efficient desialylation of tumor cells than the non-targeted Bi-Sialidase and demonstrates antitumor activity in trastuzumab-resistant and low HER2-expressing tumor models. To evaluate the potential of targeted desialylation of both tumor cells and immune cells, we designed and characterized a PD-L1-targeted sialidase in preclinical models, since PD-L1 is expressed on both tumor cells and immune cells. Furthermore, the design of the PD-L1-targeted sialidase enables the combinatorial blockade of two orthogonal immune checkpoint pathways, inhibiting both the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis and immunosuppressive sialoglycans. We generated a humanized anti-human PD-L1 antibody with comparable PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade potency to the existing anti-PD-L1 drugs, atezolizumab and avelumab. Subsequently, we constructed a bifunctional heterodimeric molecule, consisting of one chain of sialidase-Fc of a third generation of engineered human sialidase (Neu 2) and a second chain of the in-house generated anti-PD-L1 antibody. The PD-L1-targeted sialidase maintained its potency for inhibiting the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis as compared to its parental anti-PD-L1 antibody, and demonstrated improved desialylation of PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and immune cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. We tested the PD-L1-targeted sialidase in transgenic mouse tumor models that express human PD-1 and PD-L1 replacing their murine counterparts, since the parental PD-L1 antibody doesn&#8217;t cross-react with the mouse antigen. In the transgenic human PD-L1-expressing mouse colon carcinoma CT26 subcutaneous tumor model, the PD-L1-targeted sialidase exhibited enhanced efficacy compared to the Bi-Sialidase or the anti-PD-L1 antibody. Furthermore, the PD-L1-targeted sialidase demonstrated a dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and modulation of immune cell infiltration. In conclusion, these results suggested that PD-L1-targeted sialidase offers a promising cancer immunotherapeutic approach, which simultaneously inhibits immunosuppressive sialoglycans and the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis through targeted delivery of engineered human sialidase to PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and immune cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a7ace08a-30cc-4b42-8a99-be7ea3f0aa0d\/@z03B8ZXt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Targeted therapy,Immunomodulation,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jenny Che<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lihui Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wayne Gatlin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert LeBlanc<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lizhi Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Broderick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Li Peng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
