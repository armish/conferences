[{"Abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. DNA mutations drive colon tumor formation by disrupting gene regulatory mechanisms that facilitate cell survival and growth. Distinct combinations of mutations can result in unique changes to these gene regulatory mechanisms leading to variability in responses to available therapeutics. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression in CRC and it is known that their expression can be altered by oncogenic mutations. However, it is unknown how distinct combinations of CRC-risk mutations differentially affect the regulation and expression of miRNAs. <i>We hypothesize that some miRNAs will exhibit strong genotype-dependent changes in CRC whereas others will be altered irrespective of genotype<\/i>. Utilizing sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cutting-edge intestinal organoid (enteroid) models with different combinations of oncogenic mutations that commonly occur in CRC, we identified several distinct patterns of genotype-dependent miRNA expression. We also found a suite of miRNAs that are up-regulated in a mutation-independent manner. Among these, we demonstrated that miR-24-3p is a candidate master regulator of genes that are down-regulated in all mutational-contexts. RT-qPCR for miR-24-3p in genetically modified human colonoids with different combinations of oncogenic mutations further supports that miR-24-3p is elevated across various mutational contexts. Functional studies in the HCT116 cell line revealed that miR-24-3p controls the number of metabolically active, viable cells by regulating apoptosis but not proliferation. Moreover, follow-up ex vivo studies in mouse enteroids confirmed that miR-24 controls intestinal cell survival. To identify candidate gene targets that mediate the function of miR-24-3p, I performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and identified <i>HMOX1<\/i> and <i>PRSS8<\/i> as top candidate miR-24-3p targets. These findings suggest that miR-24-3p is a genotype-independent regulator of tumor cell apoptosis in CRC and merits further investigation. Overall, our findings provide a novel perspective on approaches for precision medicine in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/34e97bd8-a0da-41fe-9ac3-e1f85be91b91\/@C03B8ZJk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-03 miRNA profiling in cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,MicroRNA,Genomics,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14243"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jonathan W.

Despite advances in treatment, PDAC has a 5-year survival rate of only ~9%, necessitating a better understanding of its etiology. Risk factors for PDAC are both environmental and genetic, with heritability estimated at around 20%. However, highly penetrant coding variants are rare within the population and have been estimated to account for as little as 1% of the phenotypic variance for PDAC.<br \/>In an effort to identify common PDAC susceptibility alleles, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 17 loci at which germline variants associate with PDAC risk. Mostly localizing to non-coding loci, many such risk variants are expected to confer risk via allele-specific changes in transcription factor binding, leading to altered target gene expression over a lifetime. The identification of functional variants from GWAS is complicated by the correlation of alleles through linkage disequilibrium (LD).<br \/>Here, we have leveraged Bayesian fine mapping to identify a credible set of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in high LD at the 7q32 risk locus. Fine-mapped variants were annotated using epigenomic datasets we previously generated from a range of pancreatic cell lines, organoids and primary patient samples, encompassing histone modification marks (ChIP-seq), open chromatin (ATAC-seq) and chromatin conformation capture (Capture-HiC, HiChIP). Two variants from the credible set (rs6971499 and rs6970779) were found to consistently lie within regions annotated as super-enhancers and marked by open chromatin within our data. Both SNPs exhibit chromatin looping to the promoters of nearby plausible target genes <i>LINC-PINT <\/i>and <i>miR29a<\/i>. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) illustrate that rs6971499-T and rs6970779-G exhibit allele-specific protein binding in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines, while luciferase reporter assays in the same cell lines demonstrate that both alleles drive significant changes in transcriptional activity.<br \/>Ongoing proteomic experiments aim to identify the transcription factors differentially bound to these alleles, while CRISPR methods are being employed to validate enhancer variants in their native chromatin context. Future experiments may further characterise these transcription factors&#173;&#173; and their target genes with an eye toward better understanding their roles in PDAC carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d54f4a7c-cd76-4b60-94e7-4724d56746cb\/@C03B8ZJk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-01 Epigenetic control of miRNA expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic susceptibility,MicroRNA,Transcriptional regulation,CRISPR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14238"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aidan O'Brien<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason W.

RNA profiles have been investigated; however, obtaining reliable RNA data has been a challenge due to rapid degradation by RNases. miRNAs are short non-coding regulatory RNAs that are more stable as they are complexed with proteins or packaged in exosomes. Thus, circulating miRNA profiles have the potential to serve as a diagnostic test for cancer. Optimization of collection protocols is a crucial next step for widespread use.<i> <\/i><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Whole blood was drawn after Institutional Review Board approval. Blood was processed into either plasma or serum aliquots. The samples were stored at different temperatures (0 or 25&#176;C) for varying periods of time (0-24 hours). miRNA was extracted using a Qiagen miRNeasy Serum\/Plasma kit. Changes in profiles were assessed with RT-qPCR using a previously established panel of consistently expressed miRNAs (miR15b, miR16, miR21, miR24, miR223). Values were compared using two-tailed t-tests and values are presented as mean &#177; standard deviation.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Mean Cq values were similar at 0 and 24 hours when serum was stored on ice, suggesting negligible miRNA degradation: miR15b (29.6&#177;0.5 vs 29.8&#177;0.4, p=0.11), miR16 (23.5&#177;0.8 vs 23.3&#177;1.0, p=0.55), miR21 (28.6&#177;0.5 vs 28.9&#177;0.6, p=0.17), miR24 (27.4&#177;0.7 vs 27.0&#177;0.5, p=0.09), and miR223 (22.9&#177;0.5 vs 22.9&#177;0.7, p=0.90). There was similar stability over time for 60% of tested miRNAs when serum was left at room temperature: miR15b (30.3&#177;0.7 vs 30.7&#177;0.9, p=0.22), miR16 (23.9&#177;0.7 vs 24.3&#177;1.0, p=0.28), and miR21 (30.0&#177;0.6 vs 29.9&#177;0.6, p=0.38). Two of the miRNAs demonstrated a statistically significant increase in mean Cq after 24 hours: miR24 (27.6&#177;0.7 vs 28.2&#177;0.7, p=0.03) and miR223 (23.4&#177;0.4 vs 24.6&#177;0.6, p=&#60;0.01). In general, these trends were similar when plasma was collected, as compared to serum, at both room temperature and on ice. miRNA profiles collected from serum were overall like those obtained from plasma.<i> <\/i><br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These data confirm and expand upon past reports demonstrating the remarkable stability of miRNA. Even in suboptimal processing conditions (i.e., room temperature for 24 hours), the miRNA profile is remarkably consistent. Although blood processing and transport times may vary between institutions, our data suggest these discrepancies may not affect the efficacy of miRNA as a blood biomarker. We plan to validate our findings using bulk small RNA sequencing, which we hypothesize will similarly demonstrate minimal changes in the entire miRNA landscape in different conditions. We will then utilize our institutional biorepository to identify potentially unique miRNA profiles present in patients with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3f2f384c-2a9d-4069-adf7-7083e59bbbc6\/@C03B8ZJk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-03 miRNA profiling in cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Diagnostic marker,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14242"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erryk S.

Specifically, microRNA-21 (miR-21) is a known oncomir overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that regulates multiple gene targets downstream of KRAS, the site of the primary driver mutation in PDAC. Past efforts to target mutant KRAS have been limited by compensatory activation of other growth pathways and treatment-related toxicity. Inhibiting miR-21 expression is a novel therapeutic strategy to target KRAS effector function through post-transcriptional regulation. We previously demonstrated that systemic inhibition of miRNA-21 (miR-21) intercepts tumorigenesis in the transgenic <i>Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>;Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup>;Pdx-1-Cre <\/i>(KPC) mice without causing overt toxicity. Our major goal was to verify the translation of the previous findings to human models and examine the mechanistic implications of miR-21 inhibition in PDAC.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures: <\/b>Using publicly available data from a cohort of patients with PDAC in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we performed differential expression analysis of miR-21 and KRAS-related gene targets as well as gene set enrichment analysis of oncogenic pathways identified by the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Concurrently, de-novo patient-derived organoid (PDO) models were generated from core biopsies and surgical resection specimens. To evaluate the effects of miR-21 inhibition on KRAS pathway activity in a human model system, we selected 6 PDO cell lines and determined miR-21 gene expression by quantitative PCR at baseline and after knockdown using a lentiviral construct.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Analysis of TCGA PDAC cohort identified heterogeneous endogenous expression of miR-21, which was validated ex vivo in our PDO model system. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of gene sets associated with KRAS dependency, MEK, AKT, and MTOR signaling in patients with higher endogenous miR-21 expression. MiR-21 knockdown in PDO cell lines was stable at multiple intervals following lentiviral transduction.

This aggressive variant arises from CRPC-Adenocarcinomas (CRPC-Adeno) via a reversible trans-differentiation process, referred to as neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) wherein cells undergo a lineage switch and exhibit neuroendocrine (NE) features, characterized by expression of neuronal markers such as enolase 2 (ENO2), chromogranin A (CHGA) and synaptophysin (SYP). Currently, histopathological assessment combined with immunohistochemical detection in PCa tissues\/serum levels of neuronal markers including SYP, NSE, CHGA and CD56 is used to monitor NED in CRPC patients. However, these markers are not sufficiently specific, highlighting the urgent need of novel molecular markers to assess emergence of NED in CRPC patients. We demonstrated that progression of CRPC-Adeno to CRPC-NE states is associated with a characteristic set of miRNA alterations. Here we validate a &#8216;novel miRNA classifier&#8217; to robustly stratify CRPC-NE tumors from CRPC-Adenocarcinomas in independent clinical cohorts and deduce the optimal miRNA genes required for NEPC diagnosis.<br \/>Methods: Human FFPE sections from CRPC-Adeno and CRPC-NE patients were microdissected, RNA were extracted and small RNA sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Sequencing data were analyzed and machine learning algorithms were applied (random forest machine learning technique with leave-pair-out cross validation (LPOCV)). The performance of classifier was measured using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric.<br \/>Results: Unsupervised analysis of sequencing data by principal component analyses (PCA) revealed distinct clustering of the CRPC-NE tumors from CRPC-Adenocarcinomas based on miRNA profiles suggesting that miRNA profiles can be used to stratify these tumor types. We applied the &#8216;43-miRNA classifier data&#8217; we deduced earlier to these validation cohorts. Our analyses showed that a set of 5 miRNAs of the classifier are important in distinguishing between CRPC-Adeno vs CRPC-NE with an AUC=0.8318.<br \/>Conclusions: A &#8216;5- miRNA&#8217; classifier was validated to be of significance in two independent validation cohorts employing clinical samples from two independent sites.

In principle, tumor-suppressive miRNAs, such as miRNA-34a (miR-34a) are excellent anti-cancer agents; however, due to toxicity associated with currently used delivery vehicles and poor in vivo miRNA stability, the clinical application of miRNAs is thwarted. To overcome these challenges, we engineered two modifications to the miRNA. The first entails conjugating the miRNA to a ligand that promotes delivery specifically to cancer cells while the second involves using a fully chemically modified miRNA (FM-miR) to enhance miRNA stability. The ligand chosen for delivery, 2- [3-(1,3-dicarboxy propyl) ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA), is a high-affinity binding partner of the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), which is significantly upregulated on prostate cancer cells. We show that DUPA-miR-34a is specifically targeted to tumor cells overexpressing PSMA, is rapidly internalized by the cells, and induces target gene silencing. The binding and uptake of miR-34a by the tumor cells is dependent on conjugating the miRNA to DUPA. In vivo, DUPA-conjugates bind specifically to PSMA expressing prostate tumors with no significant uptake from normal organs or tumors with no PSMA expression. Additionally, Incorporation of the ionophore nigericin in the DUPA ligand enhances miR-34a silencing activity through facilitating its endosomal escape. However, since RNAs are inherently unstable a second modification was engineered to enhance the miRNA stability. Modifying miRNA through the inclusion of phosphorothioate linkages and 2&#8242;-fluoro and 2&#8242;-O-methyl modified ribose bases, enhances miRNA stability without compromising its activity. Fully modified miR-34a (FM-miR-34a) exhibits enhanced silencing activity of its target genes such as MET, and CD44 in comparison to partially modified miR-34a (PM-miR-34a). In addition, both PM-miR-34a and FM-miR-34a significantly inhibit cell proliferation in vitro, and the silencing of target genes requires the presence of argonaute 2 (AGO2) protein. We plan to identify the targeting differences between FM- and PM-miR-34a and will combine the DUPA ligand with FM-miR-34a to enhance both delivery and activity of miR-34a.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/77e82657-e0c4-4b1c-a113-ad61f615cd0a\/@D03B8ZJm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Targeted therapy,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14280"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ahmed M.

The high prevalence of acquired resistance to androgen deprivation therapy, as well as first and second generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonists, drives the development of lethal castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). As a result, PCa remains one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in men. AR amplification, gain of function mutations and constitutively active splice isoforms of the AR, and the overexpression of AR coregulators, play considerable roles in promoting CRPC by sustaining AR activity in the presence of the low androgen environment and\/or AR antagonists. The development of specific small molecule inhibitors of AR splice isoforms has been largely unsuccessful, and inhibitors of individual AR coregulators have not translated well into the clinic, likely due to their large number and functional redundancies. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies for targeting androgen signaling in CRPC are necessary. Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated RNAi-mediated PCa cell death through seed region (nucleotides 2-8) complementarity of shRNA\/siRNA guide strands to the 3&#8217;UTR of the AR and multiple AR coregulators and essential genes. In the current study, we used an unbiased novel seed-based shRNA screen to identify seed sequences that are toxic to different PCa cells, including CRPC cells expressing the clinically relevant constitutively active AR variant 7 (AR-V7). Common motifs were identified among toxic seed sequences, and the miRDB target prediction database was used to select those seeds that were predicted to target the AR and AR coregulators. Using RNA-seq analyses we confirmed that selected seed sequences inhibited global androgen signaling and identified potential direct targets known to be relevant to PCa. Conclusions: These studies have identified androgen signaling inhibitory sequences that have the potential to be used in RNAi-seed based therapies for PCa. The ability to inhibit the expression of the AR and multiple essential AR coregulators simultaneously with one agent, and the reduced likelihood of developed resistance, are considerable benefits of this approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/77598dfc-8dc1-4028-8038-14aa8b8a480f\/@D03B8ZJm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,siRNA,Androgen receptor,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14283"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joshua M.

The current method of clinical screening is mainly based on colonoscopy. However, many CRC patients are unwilling to undergo colonoscopy because of the high procedure cost and the discomfort during examination. Therefore, it appears necessary to find novel and non-invasive biomarkers that would improve CRC early detection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs with critical regulatory roles in fundamental cellular processes, such as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. They can act as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressors in cancer development. Numerous studies have shown significant differences in miRNAs expression in serum or plasma of CRC patients and healthy subjects. Thus, the potential use of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers in CRC seems to be a fast and relevant alternative to traditional and invasive methods. Here, we reviewed selected studies which identified dysregulated circulating miRNAs in CRC and evaluated their diagnostic value.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This meta-analysis study was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The articles were searched in online databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar to identify all eligible studies that evaluated the diagnostic value of miRNAs for CRC. Then we explored the diagnostic accuracy of each miRNA using the random-effects model to estimate the pooled sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), Positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and Negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and the area under the curve (AUC), along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager (Revman) 5.4 software and the Meta Disc software.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> Thirteen studies involving five microRNAs were included in our analysis.

Aberrant expression of micro-RNAs leads to different diseased conditions such as cancer. Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the second most prevalent cancer in Pakistan and contributes to 9.1 % of mortality annually due to late stage diagnosis and ineffective treatment. This research attempts to identify novel miRNAs candidates for their potential role as diagnostic, prognostics or therapeutic biomarkers in HNSCC patient-derived primary cells in the Pakistani population. miRNA species and their gene targets reported in HNSCC were identified using the miRbase, miRNet, and miRCancer databases, and a total of 69 miRNAs with differential expression levels in HNSCC were selected to seed a miRNA-Gene interaction network that was created using BioGrid and STRING data. Hub genes that were targeted by over-expressed miRNAs were predicted using miRTarbase. GO and KEGG analysis was carried out for the 181 interacting genes including TP53, SMAD4, PTEN, NOTCH2, and STAT3. Enrichment analysis demonstrated the increased involvement of these miRNAs in Cancer Pathways such as Hippo signaling Pathways and FoxO signaling pathways. We prioritized hub genes that were targeted by the highest number of tumor suppressor genes, and identified five miRNA species, including miR-21-5p, miR-16-5p, miR30a-5p, miR-93-5p, and miR106b-5p, as the best biomarker candidates for experimental validation.

We have previously demonstrated that miR-199a-5p is markedly downregulated in esophageal cancer cell lines compared to esophageal epithelial cells. In several miR-target sequence analysis programs, miR-199a-5p is predicted to bind JUN-B mRNA with high affinity. JUN-B is an important component of the AP1 transcription factor. The objective of this study was to determine expression of JUN-B in esophageal cancer cells as well as to investigate the interaction between miR-199a-5p and JUNB in these cells and to characterize the functional implications of this interaction.<br \/>Methods: Studies were performed in human esophageal epithelial (hESO) cells and in TE7, SK-GT-4 and OE21 human esophageal cancer cells. Expression of miR-199a-5p and JUNB mRNA in these cell lines was measured by real-time PCR. JUNB protein expression levels were examined by Western blot. Function of miR-199a-5p was tested through its overexpression and silencing. Cellular proliferation was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.<br \/>Results: Levels of miR-199a-5p in TE7, SK-GT-4, and OE21 esophageal cancer cells are markedly reduced compared to hESO cells. JUN-B mRNA and protein expression are correspondingly elevated in these cells compared to hESO cells. JUN-B mRNA and protein expression levels were decreased following miR-199a-5p overexpression in TE7, SK-GT-4 and OE21 cells. In reciprocal experiments, silencing miR-199a-5p in hESO cells resulted in increased JUN-B protein and mRNA levels. Forced expression of miR-199a-5p in TE7, SK-GT-4 and OE21 cells led to a marked decrease in cellular proliferation.<br \/>Conclusions: MiR-199a-5p expression is significantly reduced in TE7, SK-GT-4, and OE21 esophageal cancer cells relative to hESO cells. Forced expression of miR-199a-5p results in significantly decreased JUN-B mRNA and protein expression in these cells, leading to decreased cellular proliferation. These results add our understanding of the roles by which miR-199a-5p functions as a tumor suppressor in esophageal cancer cells. Further studies will investigate the association of miR-199a-5p with JUN-B mRNA using biotinylated RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays, in addition to determining the effect of Jun-B downregulation on AP1 promoter activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fb57f37e-33c9-4926-8a3e-a91f7989553d\/@D03B8ZJm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14288"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pornima Phatak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohan E.

Abnormal expression of miRNAs in cancer is associated with enhanced tumorigenesis and metastatic potential. Our previous data has shown that extracellular vesicles (EV) secreted by human lymph node stromal cells (LNSC) enhance tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). By systemic searching and modifying miRNAs carried by EV through overexpression and inhibition on LNSC, we aim to demonstrate their effect on CRC progression <i>in vitro <\/i>and orthotopic mouse model.<br \/>Methods: Total microRNA sequencing was analyzed using in-silico computer prediction models. Four overexpressed miRNAs in the LNSC-EV were selected (miR-155-5p, miR-199a-3p, mi-143-3p, and mi-214-3p). Tumor cell proliferation assay was performed using a CRC SW620 cell line transfected with selected miRNA mimics or inhibitors or controls. In our mouse model, miRNA transfected SW620 cells tagged with luciferase\/RFP, were injected into the rectal submucosa of NOD\/SCID mice. Tumor growth and metastases were observed by weekly bioluminescent imaging (BLI). At week 7, tumors were weighed and BLI of the tumors and organs were recorded. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed on the paraffin sections of tumors, livers and lung collected from these mice.<br \/>Results: In vitro proliferation assays, cells transfected with the mimic of miRNA 199a-3p significantly increased CRC SW620 cell proliferation (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01) while cells treated with the inhibitor showed decreased proliferation (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). In our orthotopic mouse model, mice with SW620 cells transfected with the mimic had increased frequencies of tumorigenesis (94% vs. 14%) and liver and lung metastasis comparing to control group (56% vs 9.5%, 50% vs 0%). Mice injected with SW620 cells transfected with the miRNA inhibitor had decreased tumor growth compared to the negative control (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: Our study shows that miRNAs carried in LNSC-EV are crucial for CRC progression. Specifically, inhibition of miRNA-199a-3p may serve as a therapeutic target in the treatment of CRC. Understanding the role and mechanisms of this miRNA in CRC could lead to the improved management of patients with CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17a574f5-9dd5-4bb0-bc47-dd61f61c6c5b\/@D03B8ZJm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,MicroRNA,Extracellular vesicles,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14290"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hallie Baer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Simon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lara McKean-Baste<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alicia N.

Prior work characterized lung PML molecular subtypes by identifying co-expressed gene modules associated with histologic severity and progression\/persistence. The proliferative subtype was enriched for PMLs with dysplasia. Genes related to interferon signaling and antigen processing\/presentation (Module 9) were decreased in progressive\/persistent lesions within this subtype, suggesting early immune suppression is related to PML progression. However, the mechanisms that drive these alterations are unclear. We investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating gene expression associated with PML outcomes.<br \/>mRNA and miRNA were extracted and sequenced from longitudinally collected endobronchial biopsies from patients with PMLs (148 samples, 30 patients). miRNAs targeting each gene co-expression module were identified based on target gene enrichment and the degree of negative correlation between the miRNA expression and its targets. Expression association with outcome within the proliferative subtype was tested with a mixed effects model adjusting for batch and patient as random effect. Cell type specificity of miRNA expression was tested based on cell type specific sequencing data from FANTOM5 and cell type marker correlation analysis. Genes regulated by NLRC5 were identified with ChIPseq data from Ludigs et al. Target gene suppression was confirmed by transfecting SW900 cells with miR-149-5p. miR-149-5p level in PML biopsies was examined by miRNA <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization (miR-ISH).<br \/>miR-149-5p is identified as potential regulator of Module 9 gene expression and is significantly up-regulated in progressive\/persistent PMLs. Its expression is highly enriched in epithelial cells in FANTOM5 and positively correlates with basal cell markers within PMLs. Predicted targets of miR-149-5p are down-regulated in the progressive PMLs in both our and data from Merrick et al. MHC-I and related gene expressions are down-regulated in progressing\/persistent PMLs. These genes are regulated by the transcriptional coactivator NLRC5 which is a predicted target gene of miR-149-5p. We find that overexpressing miR-149-5p in SW900 cells decreases the expression levels of both NLRC5 and NLRC5 regulated genes. Additionally, miR-ISH targeting miR-149-5p in proliferative biopsy samples confirm its expression in epithelium compartment and association with outcome.<br \/>Our data suggest epithelial miR-149-5p might be a key regulator of gene expression contributing to PML progression. We hypothesize that by suppressing NLRC5, miR-149-5p inhibits MHC-I gene expression of epithelial cells, promoting early immune depletion and lesion progression. miR-149-5p might therefore be a therapeutic target for preventing PML progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6bc8b045-2b12-4d23-ba60-1f348ef69869\/@D03B8ZJm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Premalignancy,MicroRNA,Immunosuppression,Progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14287"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Boting Ning<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roxana M.

Limited or extensive-stage SCLC patients have limited therapeutic options due to a lack of potential drug targets. In the quest for novel therapeutic molecules, we performed micro-RNA sequencing from the serum samples and also analyzed bulk RNA-sequencing data from tumors of SCLC patients. We found a consistent downregulation of miR-1 in SCLC. These results were recapitulated in SCLC cell lines and tumor tissues compared to their matched normal. To assess the therapeutic potential of miR-1, we overexpressed miR-1 in SCLC cell lines that translated into decreased cell growth and oncogenic signaling. Mechanistic studies revealed that CXCR4 is a direct target for miR-1 in SCLC. Intracardiac injection of SCLC cell lines in the mouse models showed that overexpression of miR-1 decreases the distant organ metastasis, whereas miR-1 sponging potentiates aggressiveness and metastasis. Furthermore, we identified FOXM1-RRM2 as a unique downstream target of the miR-1\/CXCR4 axis involved in the growth and metastasis of SCLC. Our results showed that FOXM1 directly binds to the promoter site of RRM2 and regulates its activity. Overexpression of miR-1 decreases the expression and activity of FOXM1-RRM2 through CXCR4 that reduces cell growth and metastasis. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-1 decreases SCLC metastasis by targeting the CXCR4\/FOXM1-RRM2 axis and has a high potential for the development of novel SCLC therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb0749cb-77a8-43be-a071-22424a1c36cf\/@E03B8ZJn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,MicroRNA,Metastasis,Tumor suppressor gene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14285"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Parvez Khan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jawed A.

Despite innovations in cancer therapeutics, due to resistance to these therapeutics, the 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic lung cancer has remained poor. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop new and effective therapeutics, including the study of RNA-based therapeutics. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) modified tumor suppressor miRNAs significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy, stability, and deliverability of miRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic cancer. In this study, we have characterized the therapeutic potential of miR-129 modified with 5-FU (5-FU-miR-129) in non-small cell lung cancer<i> in vitro<\/i> via Annexin V staining, cell cycle analysis, and Western Blot. 5-FU-miR-129&#8217;s therapeutic potential was also assessed<i> in vivo<\/i> via IVIS imaging of NSCLC xenografts. We have demonstrated that 5-FU-miR-129 can induce apoptosis (7.2-fold in A549 and 2.9-fold in Calu-1) and cell cycle arrest (12.7-fold change in G1\/S phase ratio in A549) in NSCLC<i> in vitro<\/i>. Furthermore, 5-FU-miR-129 has been found to retain target specificity by downregulating miR-129 targets BCL2 and HMGB1 in a cell line-dependent manner. As was observed in previous studies, we have also demonstrated the ability of 5-FU-miR-129 to be delivered in cancer cells without the use of a transfection vehicle<i> in vitro<\/i>. Finally, we were also able to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of 5-FU-miR-129 in inhibiting NSCLC tumor growth<i> <\/i><i>in vivo,<\/i> as seen by a significantly decreased change in tumor growth by 37 days post-treatment in the 5-FU-miR-129 treated group compared to the negative control group (79.8% reduction in tumor growth). In addition, we observed a significant increase in survival probability and a reduced hazard ratio in mice treated5-FU-miR-129 when compared to the negative control group. Furthermore, we did not observe any visible side effects (hair loss) of mice treated with 5-FU-miR-129 compared to chemotherapeutic drugs 5-FU and gemcitabine (Gem). 5-FU-miR-129&#8217;s therapeutic potential in NSCLC further demonstrates the potential for modified miRNAs as a platform technology in cancer therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cd6c124f-1d64-438c-9121-a1ffafd961a1\/@E03B8ZJn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,5-Fluorouracil,miR-129,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14278"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ga-Ram Hwang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John G.

Although the treatment of GC patients has improved during the last decades, thanks to advancements in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the long-term survival rates of patients with GC remains around 20%. In addition, late diagnosis usually occurs due to the absence of symptoms or the presence of non-specific symptoms in early stages of the disease. Thus, the continuous study of new strategies for early diagnosis and identification of novel therapeutic approaches is of great interest, to reduce the need for mutilating surgeries and morbid adjuvant therapies. Next-generation sequencing technologies unveiled new roles and functions of RNAs, particularly, non-coding RNAs. Among the most studied molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play important roles in different physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. Therefore, the goals of this project are (1) to determine the miRNA profile of patients with GC using tumor tissue samples using next-generation sequencing; and (2) to validate the expression profile of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in serum from patients with GC. To identify DE microRNAs between GC tissues and gastric tissues from individuals without cancer, 24 samples (17 cancer and 7 controls) were sequenced using the Ion Torrent PGM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) sequencing equipment. Preliminary results indicate that there are 54 DE miRNAs among the 269 known human miRNAs identified, where 44 were upregulated, while 10 were downregulated in samples from GC patients when compared to samples from individuals without cancer. As expected, Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) revealed that the disease most frequently associated with these DE miRNAs is the digestive system neoplasm. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that neoplasm metastasis is the phenotype most associated with this subset of DE miRNAs, indicating that these miRNAs possibly contribute to cell invasion and migration in gastric tumors. To confirm these findings, further experiments are now being performed, such as validation of the DE miRNAs by qRT-PCR in tissue and serum of GC samples, as well as functional studies. Thereby, the identification of a circulating signature of miRNAs will allow a better understanding of physiopathology of gastric carcinogenesis and the identification of possible biomarkers, which may help in early diagnosis, prognosis, and development of novel anticancer therapies.Funding: MACS, Funda&#231;&#227;o de Amparo &#224; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#227;o Paulo (FAPESP) grant # 2016\/25562-0; MACS, Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq) grant # 2018\/301127-2; MACS, Coordena&#231;&#227;o de Aperfei&#231;oamento de Pessoal de N&#237;vel Superior (CAPES) 23038051640\/2009-01; BTRK, Postdoctoral Fellowship, FAPESP 2019\/20592-6; CAP, CAPES Doctoral Fellowship 88882.430351\/2019-01.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e7e851fd-1b9d-47ac-bbda-14618718be0d\/@E03B8ZJn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-03 miRNA profiling in cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,MicroRNA,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Serum,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14240"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bruno Takao Real Karia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camila Albuquerque Pinto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leonardo Caires<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeda Beatriz Louredo dos Santos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fernanda Wisnieski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolina Gigek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marilia De Arruda Cardoso Smith<\/i><\/presenter>.

In our study, we performed the expression analysis of miR-27a-5p in a retrospective cohort of 232 breast cancer (BC) patients with a median follow-up of 99.4 months enrolled according to the REMARK guidelines. Of those patients, 9 showed synchronous metastases (MTX), 45 developed metastases during the follow-up time (M0&#62;M1), and 178 were free from metastases after a follow-up of at least 5 years (M0). As controls, 13 normal breast tissues (NBTs) from reductive mammoplasty and 11 pre-invasive breast lesions (PreBr) were also profiled. Overall, miR-27a-5p showed higher levels in NBTs (Median 2.28, IQR 1.50-5.40) and pre-invasive breast lesions (Median 3.32, IQR 1.68-4.32) compared to tumour samples. In particular, miR-27a-5p was less expressed in patients with synchronous (Median 1.03 IQR 0.83-1.58) or metachronous (Median 1.83, IQR 1.29-3.17) metastases than in patients free from metastases after a 5-year follow-up (Median 2.17, IQR 1.19-3.64). Thus, we found that miR-27a-5p expression (log values) is negatively correlated with breast pathology evolution (R= -0.13, P=0.038). Next, we assessed the potentialities of miR-27a-5p as BC-specific prognostic biomarker in the subgroup of patients without metastases at diagnosis (n=222). Moreover, increased miR-27a-5p levels were associated with reduced risk of disease progression (Progression Free Survival (PFS) HR 0.43, 95%CI 0.18-0.99, P=0.048), metastases development (Metastases Free survival (MFS) HR 0.42, 95%CI 0.18-0.96, P=0.039), and cancer-related death (Overall Survival (OS) HR 0.30, 95%CI 0.12-0.74, P=0.009) in the subgroup of <i>HER2<\/i>-amplified tumours (n=26). Then, we extended our analysis to the TCGA BRCA dataset by selecting a total of 561 cases without synchronous metastases, for whom miR-27a-5p expression levels, and clinical and follow-up data were available. Among them, 19 were <i>HER2 <\/i>amplified according to clinical guidelines (i.e. score 3+ at immunostaining or FISH-positive). Similarly to our internal cohort, high miR-27a-5p was associated to reduced risk of disease progression (PFS HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.10-3.61) and death (OS HR 0.62, 95%CI 0.08-5.05) in the subgroup<i> <\/i>of <i>HER2-<\/i>amplified cases, although the association did not reach statistical significance. Overall, our data support the tumour suppressive role of miR-27a-5p in breast cancer, and suggest miR-27a-5p as putative prognostic biomarker in <i>HER2<\/i>-amplified tumours.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-04 miRNA-based diagnostics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Biomarkers,MicroRNA,HER2\/neu,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14258"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Barbara Pasculli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Fontana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Serena Barile<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morritti Maria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luigi Ciuffreda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo Graziano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evaristo Maiello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Paola Parrella<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Drug resistance is one of the key barriers in the treatment of cancer, contributing to the poor prognoses in patients. To overcome this hurdle, we sought to exploit the inherent multi-targeted nature of miRNAs for the development of cancer therapeutics. Despite its potential, it remains a challenge to deliver nucleic acid-based therapies, including miRNAs, to cancer cells. We recently developed a novel approach to modify miRNAs by replacing its uracil bases with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the guide strand of tumor suppressor miRNAs. This modification combines the therapeutic effects of a traditional chemotherapeutic with the effect of a tumor suppressor miRNA to create a potent, multi-targeted therapeutic molecule. We have previously demonstrated that 5-FU-modified miR-15a (where the prefix 5-FU- refers to the modified miRNA mimetic, i.e., 5-FU-miR-15a) and 5-FU-miR-129 have several key features such as the retention of target gene specificity, vehicle-free delivery, enhanced potency, and stability in colon and pancreatic cancer. To demonstrate the general applicability of this approach for other tumor suppressor miRNAs we selected 12 well-studied tumor suppressor miRNAs and modified them with 5-FU. The efficacy of these 12 different miRNA mimetics were screened in several cancer types including gastric, lung, breast, pancreatic, and blood cancer. Our results show that 5-FU-modified miRNAs are more effective at inhibiting cancer cell proliferation than its unmodified counterparts. In gastric cancer, there is an 8.4-fold increase in efficacy after modifying let-7a (let-7a IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 59.5 nM vs. 5-FU-let-7a IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 7.1 nM) and a 4.3-fold increase for miR-145 (miR-145 IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 20.9 nM vs. 5-FU-miR-145 IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 4.9 nM). Similarly in lung cancer, there is a 6.3-fold increase in efficacy after modifying let-7a (let-7a IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 143.5 nM vs. 5-FU-let-7a IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 22.8 nM) and a 13.8-fold increase (miR-145 IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 51.7 nM vs. 5-FU-miR-145 IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 11.0 nM). We also show that these miRNA mimetics can be delivered into cancer cells without the aid of a delivery vehicle. Additionally, this modification preserves miRNA target gene suppression activity and has 5-FU activity from its breakdown products. Lastly, in a CT26 syngeneic mouse colon cancer model, we demonstrate that 5-FU-miR-15a inhibits tumor growth by 58.2% without vehicle and is enhanced to 97.2% with a low concentration of vehicle. Notably, there was no observable toxicity in the animal studies. This work demonstrates the potential of fluoropyrimidine-modification that can be applicable to a broad spectrum of tumor suppressor miRNAs in different cancer types and represents an advancement in the development of therapeutic miRNAs for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d6eb6cd-a633-4477-b74a-c268720e7178\/@E03B8ZJn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Therapeutics,Chemoresistance,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14282"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John G.

Because miRNA downregulate translation proteins associated with cancer progression, miRNA-based therapeutics have great potential as anticancer drugs. Nonetheless, the therapeutic potential of miRNA replacement is limited due to lack of safe and efficient delivery vehicles, and inability to target miRNAs to the intended cells\/tissues. Thus, identifying molecules that are able to deliver therapeutic miRNA is of critical need. This could be achieved by targeting receptors that are overexpressed on target tumor cells. For example, the folate receptor (FR) is overexpressed on various tumor types including breast, lung, ovarian and brain tumors. Our laboratory has previously developed a unique strategy that directly links a miRNA mimic to the high affinity FR ligand, folate (FolamiRs). In the present work, to further improve the potency of FolamiRs, we introduce the reduced folate metabolite, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) that maintains nanomolar affinity for the FR at pH 7, but disengages from the FR at a significantly higher pH than that of folate, which is important when including an endosomal escape agent that typically disrupts endosomal acidification. We synthesize and conjugate 5-MTHF ligand to the potent tumor suppressor miRNA-34a (5-MTHF-miR-34a). We show that 5-MTHF-miR-34a uptake is specific to the cells overexpressing FR and represses target gene expression. Our data supports the use of 5-MTHF in combination with the endosomal escape agent, nigericin, to achieve robust cytosolic localization of therapeutically relevant miRNAs such as miR-34a. This work provides the foundation for future studies using 5-MTHF- conjugated therapeutic agents for targeting additional FR expressing cells, including myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and macrophages. Collectively these studies will pave the way for developing 5-MTHF-based small RNA conjugates for treating FR-expressing cancers. The details of these intriguing results will be discussed in the poster.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b66a569f-f3af-43b2-809c-a815b384102f\/@E03B8ZJn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,MicroRNA,Targeted drug delivery,Folate receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14276"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sudarsan R.

Indeed, some RNAi products (e.g., siRNAs) have been approved for clinical practice by the United State Food and Drug Administration while many others, including genome-derived miRNAs, are under active investigations. However, current research and development relies predominantly on the use of chemo-engineered RNA mimics made in vitro that are different from natural RNA molecules produced and folded in vivo. This is also in sharp contrast to protein research and therapy that primarily uses bioengineered or recombinant proteins produced and folded in vivo, instead of synthetic polypeptides or proteins made in vitro. Therefore, we have devoted large efforts to producing true biologic RNA molecules to better recapitulate the properties of natural RNA molecules for research and drug development. Herein I will present our one-of-a-kind RNA bioengineering technology that achieves high-yield, large-scale and cost-effective, in vivo fermentation production of biologic RNAs (BioRNAs) consisting of target RNAi molecules (e.g., miRNAs or siRNAs). Examples will be presented to demonstrate the precise release of payload RNAi molecules from BioRNAs in human cells and subsequently, modulate target gene expression and various cancer cellular processes. In addition, biologic RNAi prodrugs are effective to control tumor growth and metastasis in clinically relevant xenograft mouse models. Our results demonstrate that bioengineered RNA molecules are a novel class of agents for cancer research and drug development.

In both blood and cervical cells, higher miR-21 expression (p= 0.032 and 0.198, respectively) and lower miR-125b expression (p= 0.050 and 0.004, respectively) were observed in HIV+ women compared with HIV-women. In blood, a lower expression of miR-146a was observed in HIV+ women compared with HIV- women (p= 0.036) whereas in cervical cells, lower expressions of miR-182 and miR-200c were observed in HIV+ women compared with HIV- women (p= 0.035 and 0.045, respectively). The low expression of miR-146a, miR-182, and miR-200c in HIV+ women could be due to immune exhaustion, viral immune evasive mechanism, or an indicator of viral latency while the higher expression of miR-21, and lower expression of miR-125b and p53 could be early indicators of genetic instability prior to epithelial transformation.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study suggests that circulating high expression of miR-21 and low expression of miR-125b and p53 gene could be used in identifying individuals at risk of developing Ca, especially among immunocompromised patients.<br \/><b>Keywords:<\/b> Human immunodeficiency virus, Cervical cancer, Detection, Biomarkers, MicroRNAs","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/147f3ae8-cc0e-4c06-a3a6-b15f732b9fc4\/@E03B8ZJn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,AIDS-related malignancies,p53,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14286"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jude Ogechukwu Okoye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Ajuluchukwu Ngokere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Chinedum Onyenekwe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Ifedioranma Ogenyi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olaposi Omotuyi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Persistent infections with high-risk HPV (hrHPV) genotypes can lead to high-grade lesions (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 2 or higher, CIN2+), that if left untreated progress to cancer. hrHPV test has high sensitivity to detect CIN2+, but it has low specificity because close to 90% of women spontaneously clear the infection. Biomarkers to stratify hrHPV+ women with cervical lesions that may progress to cancer are needed. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression, can be detected in cervical scrapes, and are differentially expressed between high- and low-grade lesions.<br \/><b>Aim<\/b> To identify miRNAs differentially expressed between CIN3+ and &#8804;CIN1 lesions and evaluate their potential use as biomarkers to distinguish CIN3+ in hrHPV+ women.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> We used miRNAseq to compare miRNAs expression patterns in cervical scrapes of hrHPV+ women: 35 with low-grade lesions (NEG= 26; CIN1= 9) and 36 with high-grade lesions (CIN3= 32; SCC= 4). The samples were collected through the ASCUS-COL Trial in Medellin, Colombia. Women with low- or high-grade cervical lesions exhibit similar sociodemographic characteristics (Chi-square p-values&#62;0.05). The RNAseq data were processed in GeneGlobe-QIAGEN, which incorporates cut-adapt, bowtie and DeSEq2. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses with a 95% confidence interval of Area Under the Curve (AUC) were made to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each miRNA differentially expressed, to detect CIN3+. Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis using normalized counts of mapped reads identified a combination of the differentially expressed miRNAs that best predicted CIN3+. We identified putative pathways using MetaCore.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> An average of &#62;9 million reads by sample and around 3.5 million reads mapped to miRBase V21 was obtained. The principal component analysis did not show factors that could introduce bias to differential gene expression analysis. We identified 38 miRNAs differentially expressed. Compared to <u>&#60;<\/u>CIN1 lesions, 9 miRNAs were overexpressed and 29 underexpressed in CIN3+ lesions. Six miRNAs presented AUC&#62;0.60 (p-value &#60;0.05) to detect CIN3+. The best predictive combination of 9 miRNAs exhibits an AUC of 0.89, 95% CI (0.83 - 0.97), of which 4 were overexpressed and 5 underexpressed in CIN3+ vs <u>&#60;<\/u>CIN1. Interestingly, 5 miRNAs underexpressed in CIN3+, target VEGF, a known angiogenic mediator linked to malignancy.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> We identified miRNAs differentially expressed with good diagnostic performance to distinguish high- from low-grade lesions in cervical scrapes samples. Further validation on a larger cohort of cervical scrapes samples is needed to confirm the potential role of these miRNAs to triage hrHPV+ women.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e622c01-6e4d-40eb-a125-2740e1c50d62\/@E03B8ZJn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-04 miRNA-based diagnostics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Cervical cancer,MicroRNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14256"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Martha Isabel González Ramírez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Agudelo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Cecilia Agudelo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jone Garai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Alberto Orozco Castaño<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jovanny Zabaleta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gloria Inés Sánchez Vásquez<\/i><\/presenter>.
