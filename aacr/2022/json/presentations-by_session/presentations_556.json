[{"Abstract":"Cancer metastasis remains the key barrier for patient&#8217;s cure. Tumor metastasis initiating from a single disseminated cell into the invasive nodule in the foreign microenvironment is poorly understand. In this study, we established the intravenous injection pulmonary metastatic model followed by single-cell RNA sequencing of disseminating cells from mice lungs at different timepoints, we identified a cluster of SLPI-high esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells that mediates the lung metastasis evolution and predicts worse overall survival of ESCC patients. GSEA analysis reveals that the SLPI-high subset is functionally associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and neutrophil activation during lung metastasis. Immune infiltration prediction from TIMER also confirmed that high SLPI is tightly correlated with more abundance of neutrophils in the ESCC tumor microenvironment. SLPI is reported to drive the metastasis progression through regulating the vascular mimicry. In the next step, further in-vitro and in-vivo studies is required to explore the role of SLPI in ESCC cells in promoting lung metastasis evolution. We identified a SLPI+ ESCC cells with high pluripotency that particularly initiates the metastasis process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7647313e-720f-41cf-8df9-64de03a6a517\/@q03B8ZTA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,ESCC,neutrophil,SLPI,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17992"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yu Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ching Ngar Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lanqi Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin-yuan Guan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beibei Ru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beilei Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

The title of metastatic-initiating cells (MICs) has been designated to describe tumor subpopulation with heterogeneous genetic background and behaviors that potentially displays stemness features and favors metastatic lesion formation. However, preceding studies have overpassed the early surviving MICs due to limitations in bulk transcriptomic sequencing at macrometastatic stage. With the aim of denoting and characterizing MICs in ESCC, we established the pulmonary metastatic mice model via intravenous injection and followed by multiplex single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of tumor cells collected from lung tissues along longitudinal end-points. The scRNA-Seq results uncover a 7-gene surface marker signature panel that could depict the early surviving MICs of ESCC, including CD44, TACSTD2, TM4SF1, S100A14, RHOD, CST6, and C19orf33. <i>In silico<\/i> gene ontology (GO) enrichment of the early surviving MICs subpopulation reveals numerous migration and adhesion-related biological processes (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). In addition to scRNA-Seq, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor cells in mice lungs collected in sequential order evidenced the survival heterogeneity of tumor subpopulations. Likewise, flow cytometry fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of signature-enriched tumor cells was performed to resemble the target MICs.

While EMT cooperates with MMP activity in glioblastoma multiforme, the molecular crosstalk between TGF-&#946; signaling and MT1-MMP however remains poorly understood. Here, the existence of common EMT biomarkers, induced through TGF-&#946; and MT1-MMP inducer Concanavalin A (ConA), was explored using RNA-seq analysis and differential gene arrays in human U87 glioblastoma cells. TGF-&#946; and ConA triggered SNAIL and Fibronectin expressions in a dose-dependent manner. Those inductions were antagonized by the TGF-&#946; receptor kinase inhibitor Galunisertib, the JAK\/STAT inhibitors AG490 and Tofacitinib, and by the diet-derived epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Transient gene silencing of MT1-MMP prevented the induction of SNAIL by ConA and abrogated TGF-&#946;-induced cell chemotaxis. Moreover, ConA induced STAT3 and Src phosphorylation suggesting these pathways to be involved in the MT1-MMP-mediated signaling axis that led to SNAIL induction. Our findings highlight a new signaling axis linking MT1-MMP to TGF-&#946;-mediated EMT-like induction in glioblastoma cells, which process can be prevented by the diet-derived EGCG<b><i><\/i><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/503ff355-d916-43b9-9069-1d04a4e256b8\/@q03B8ZTA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),EGCG,Snail,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17995"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"b4c88c24-7353-4507-b6d4-d1788515040f","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b4c88c24-7353-4507-b6d4-d1788515040f\/@q03B8ZTA\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Souad Djediai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Narjara Gonzalez Suarez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoé Joly-Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Borhane Annabi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although the research on breast cancer treatment has made some progress, metastatic breast cancer is still incurable. Bone is the most common site for breast cancer metastasis. This work is dedicated to the use of mass cytometry and single cell analysis to explore the molecular alterations in the marrow immune microenvironment which participates the dormancy and activation of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). Firstly, four Balb\/c mouse breast cancer bone metastasis groups were established. Animals were divided into intracardiac injection group (n=10), subcutaneous injection group (n=10), tumor resection and suture group (n=10), and control group (n=10). In the intracardiac injection group, a breast cancer bone metastatic model was constructed by directly injecting mCherry-labeled 4T1 cells into the left ventricle. After detecting obvious bone metastasis by bioluminescence imaging (BLI), femur and tibia bone marrow were excised for flow cytometry cell sorting, mass cytometry and single cell analysis. Both the subcutaneous and the resection and suture groups were injected with mCherry-labeled 4T1 cells into the right-back of Balb\/c mice. In the tumor resection and suture group, the tumor was removed at the time when the subcutaneous tumor was just palpable. In the subcutaneous injection group, the animals were sacrificed when tumor volume reached 1 cubic centimeter. The classification of bone marrow cells was determined by using fluorescent dye labeled CD45, CD4, CD8, CD19, NK1.1, CD11b, CD11c, IA\/IE, Ly6C, Ly6G and other antibodies. Constructed as a local immune landscape in the marrow, certain numbers of B cells and T cells, in the bone marrow of mice with breast cancer bone metastasis were significantly less than those in control mice, indicating that the acquired immunity of the mice with bone metastasis is diminished. In addition, the proportions of CD11b<sup>+<\/sup> myeloid cells and neutrophils in the marrow of mice with bone metastasis were significantly higher than that in the control group, whereas the proportion of macrophages and eosinophils were all significantly decreased indicating that the bone marrow immune environment has changed in the process of tumor occurrence and metastasis. Research is ongoing, including ex-marrow spleen cell analysis in those animals, to explore the mechanism of the interaction between the immune microenvironment and tumor cells that determines tumor heterogeneity and sensitivity to therapy.

Among its variants, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is considered the most aggressive due to its early age of diagnosis, invasive and metastatic properties with poor prognosis. TNBC is a type of breast cancer that lacks expression of the receptors that are commonly found in this type of cancer (estrogen, progesterone, and HER2), which makes it a more difficult target for treatment. Cancer invasiveness and metastasis are known to be promoted by increased cell motility and upregulation of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and WASP family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) - WAVE1, WAVE2, and WAVE3. While the contribution of WAVE2 to cancer progression is well documented, the WAVE2-mediated regulation of TNBC oncogenic properties is still under investigated. In this study, we show that WAVE2 plays a significant role in TNBC development, progression, and metastasis. To investigate this notion, we used CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing to successfully inhibit WAVE2 expression in several TNBC cell lines. In vitro, loss of WAVE2 expression inhibited 3D tumorsphere formation and invasion of TNBC cells. In vivo, in mouse models for TNBC, loss of WAVE2 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, we show that the WAVE2-mediated modulation of the oncogenic behavior of TNBC cells is in part due to its phosphorylation downstream of EGF. At the post transcriptional level, we found WAVE2 expression to be regulated by miR29. Together, our findings identify a novel post-translational WAVE2\/EGF oncogenic signaling axis, along with a post-transcriptional regulatory axis downstream of miR29, which together regulate the oncogenic activity of WAVE2 in TNBC and open a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/59211a96-0a5e-4626-b780-566fdd9a3dbe\/@r03B8ZTB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),EGF,MicroRNA,Phosphorylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17997"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Priyanka S.

The prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer remains poor, with a 5-year metastasis survival rate of 20%-30%. Membrane spanning 4 domains subfamily A (MS4A) is an evolving family of structurally related cell surface proteins. Previous studies demonstrated that MS4A12 expression in CRC was significantly higher than that in the normal tissues. And low expression of MS4A12 in CRC was associated with poor survival in patients. However, the impact and mechanism of MS4A12 c.C211T stop-gain single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2298553) on the metastatic phenotype of CRC have not previously been examined. Current opinion holds that SNP introducing premature termination codons could alter the stability and function of transcripts and proteins. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between MS4A12 stop-gain SNP and invasion and migration of CRC cells. Methods: Whole exome sequencing and target sequencing were used to screen SNP related to distant metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray was used to detect proteins in CRC tumor cancer and normal tissues. Recombinant plasmids carrying wild-type (CC) and MS4A12 c.C211T stop-gain SNP (TT) were constructed and then transfected to colon cancer cell lines DLD1, RKO. Knockdown of MS4A12 used the short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Western blot was performed to detect the level of protein expression. Wound healing essay, migration and invasion assays were used to detect metastatic ability of CRC. RNA-seq analysis, co-immunoprecipitation and mass assays were performed to further mechanism. Results: MS4A12 c.C211T stop-gain SNP (rs2298553) was screened and identified to be associated with CRC metastasis. Tissue microarray revealed that the expression of MS4A12 was lower in the colorectal tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. The low expression of MS4A12 in CRC was associated with a poor prognosis in patients. The expression level of the TT group was close to that of the basal level of empty vector transfected groups, which suggested that the c.C211T stop-gain SNP (rs2298553) inhibited truncated MS4A12 protein expression. Compared to the CC group, the TT group showed significantly increased invasion and migration ability. Meanwhile, MS4A12 knockdown also promoted invasion and migration. GO and KEGG pathway analysis suggested that the Hippo signaling pathway might be associated with the inhibition of migration and invasion by MS4A12. Compared to the CC group, the TT group impedes YAP\/TAZ phosphorylation and facilitates YAP\/TAZ nuclear translocation. Conclusion: MS4A12 c.C211T stop-gain SNP (rs2298553) promotes the invasion and migration of CRC. These results provide an important theoretical basis for studying the invasion and migration of CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d5b4586-26e3-4eef-9a15-626969ee4042\/@r03B8ZTB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SNP,Hippo,stop-gain,MS4A12,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17999"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shuang Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ting Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haina Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiwei Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuanhong Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiwei Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Lung cancer and breast cancer account for most brain metastasis. KRAS-mutant NSCLC compose a third lung adenocarcinoma, among which 17% to 55% will develop brain metastases. Likewise, more than a third HER2-positive breast cancer will develop brain metastasis. Among existing animal models, the ectopic injection in brain cannot reflect the mechanism of tumor invasion and metastasis, while tail vein and intra-cardiac injection usually produces extra-cerebral metastatic disease and the animals have to be sacrificed before brain metastases appeared. Here we developed several metastasis models injected by intra-carotid artery (ICA) to address these problems. Two KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and two HER2-positive breast cancer cells selected by their metastasize potential were luciferase labeled for in vivo imaging and drug evaluation. The tumor pathology in brain was evaluated by H&#38;E staining. Compared to ectopic models, these ICA models have natural dissemination and progression in the brain, which recapitulate the different pattern of metastatic lesions in the clinic. With synchronized growth rate and little variation compared to tail vein and intra-cardiac models, these tumor growth kinetics allow for more appropriate animal efficacy study. Both KRAS-sensitive and insensitive models have been developed and validated for the next generation drug development; HER-2 positive breast models with ICA method also showed a good discriminative power on anti-HER2 modalities including antibodies, small molecules and ADC. Meanwhile, ICA models with human immune cell reconstitution were also developed to support immune therapies in pre-clinical stage. In summary, we have developed a panel of intra-carotid artery brain metastatic models for drug evaluation, and demonstrated their superiority in growth kinetics, brain microenvironment, drug selectivity and immune component. These models can be a promising predictive tool for novel drug\/modality discovery to target brain metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e7352ed-3a74-4029-a4bb-4ff79b847d94\/@r03B8ZTB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,KRAS,HER2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18001"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fuyang Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuying Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haoxia Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunlei Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bingrui Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengyao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xia Xiong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuzhen Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qunsheng Ji<\/i><\/presenter>.

Nearly 80% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 60% of them are diagnosed at the metastatic stage. Brain metastases affect more than 20% of NSCLC patients with poor prognosis and disabling symptoms. However, few therapies have been approved for the treatment of lung cancer brain metastases. A panel of rapid, predictive and clinically-relevant animal models are urgently needed to study the biology of brain metastases and to identify effective therapeutic approaches.Considering both progression and treatment of lung cancer brain metastases will be limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), here we describe methods for efficient establishment of brain metastases mouse models via different injection route (intracranial, intracardiac or intracarotid), to identify a model that permits tumor cell growth in the unique brain microenvironment without compromising BBB. Meanwhile, we established a novel ROS1 positive patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model together with its PDC sub-line, in which the exon 2 of SDC4 was fused to the exon 32 of ROS1 (SDC4ex2-ROS1ex32). The cell has been transduced with firefly luciferase expression vector for <i>in vivo <\/i>imaging detection. Three ROS1 inhibitors were tested on these brain metastasis and subcutaneous models to compare their efficacies. In summary, we established brain metastases lung cancer PDX models as reliable platforms for interrogation of targets and kinetics related mechanism and for drug screening. The use of such techniques will increase our knowledge of the metastatic process and help identify new targets of cancer metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/809cb153-7152-4aae-8ec4-eb3dc1c9c6e3\/@r03B8ZTB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Brain metastasis,ROS1,Blood-brain barrier,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18002"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hui Qi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xia Xiong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huanhuan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuying Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunlei Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haoxia Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bingrui Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuzhen Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qunsheng Ji<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite their FDA approval, the therapeutic benefits of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are limited to BRCA1\/2 mutated malignancies. Moreover, the PARPi olaparib has been shown to upregulate the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) leading to immune suppression. The purpose of this study is to investigate if a novel nanoparticle formulation of oligomer hyaluronic acid (oHA) and doxorubicin (DOX) co-loaded in an iRGD-conjugated polymer-lipid nanocarrier (iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLN) can inhibit DNA damage repair and suppress PD-L1 in both mutant and non-mutant TNBC cells and reduce tumor progression and lung metastasis compared to the PARPi olaparib. We postulate that the co-administered oHA will block the signaling pathways of native hyaluronic acid (HA) receptors, the cluster of differentiation 44 (CD 44) and receptor for HA mediated motility (RHAMM), that regulate DNA damage repair and immunosuppression and enhance DOX efficacy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In vitro cellular uptake of various DOX formulations by TNBC MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells and MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1 mutant) cells was examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy or spectrophotometer. The expression level of RHAMM, PD-L1, and PARP1 parylation (PAR) was evaluated after treatment with iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLN or olaparib in both cell lines using western blot or confocal laser scanning microscopy. The therapeutic efficacy of iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLN compared to olaparib was determined by monitoring the tumor progression and lung metastasis development in orthotopic breast tumor models of MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN or MDA-MB-436 cell line.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The expression of native HA receptor RHAMM was profoundly reduced by ~5 folds in vivo and the DNA DSB was significantly increased by the iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLN treatment with 40 % of &#947;H2AX positive cells in tumor tissue sections. The iRGD-functionalized PLN enhanced DOX cellular uptake compared to DOX free drug or non-targeted NPs by ~3- and ~1.5-fold, in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells, respectively. While olaparib upregulated PD-L1 and free DOX increased PAR level, the iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLN reduced the parylation and PD-L1 expression in both TNBC cell lines. The iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLN treatment (two dose of 10 mg\/kg i.v. biweekly) outperformed olaparib (twenty doses of 50 mg\/kg i.p 5x\/week) in preventing tumor progression and lung metastasis in vivo over a 4-week period.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The results suggest that the iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLN can effectively inhibit DNA damage repair and immunosuppression of cancer cells and could be a promising multitargeted nanomedicine for the treatment of both BRCA1-mutant and non-mutant metastatic TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea8af5cd-de14-4522-96eb-12d029677096\/@r03B8ZTB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,DNA repair,Immunosuppression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18003"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ibrahim Alradwan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pei Zhi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>HoYin Lip<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdulmutalib Zetrini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunsheng He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffery Henderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Rauth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Yu Wu<\/i><\/presenter>.

It has been reported that about 83,730 new cases of bladder cancer and 17,200 deaths from bladder cancer occurred in 2021. Therefore, the discovery of new alternative medication becomes extremely important for reduction of cancer mortality. Isorhapontigenin (ISO), a phytopolyphenol, is derivative stilbene isolated from the Chinese herb Gnetum cleistostachyum. It has been reported that ISO exhibits multiple anticancer activities in human high grade invasive bladder cancer cells. Our previous study has demonstrated that ISO treatment increased methyltransferase 14, N6-adenosine-methyltransferase subunit (METTL14), subsequently decreased vimentin, a key member of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), resulting in reduced invasion of bladder cancer T24T cells. Autophagy maintains normal cell homeostasis through the removal of oncogenic protein substrates, toxic unfolded proteins and damaged organelles. Tumor-promoting or tumor-inhibiting functions of autophagy depends on the cancer type and stage. Sestrin 2, a member of stress-inducible protein family which is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, is involved in the autophagy initiation. Beclin 1, a key autophagy regulator, is involved in multiple stages of autophagy. The present study investigated the mechanisms of ISO-inhibited migration and invasion in bladder cancer cells by focusing on Sestrin 2 and Beclin 1 pathways. Our results showed that ISO treatment in bladder cancer T24T decreased both migration and invasion as assessed by using transwell assays. However, in T24T cells with Sestrin 2 knockdown or Beclin 1 knockdown ISO lost the inhibitory effect on migration and invasion. The results from immunoblotting analysis showed that knockdown of Sestrin 2 or Beclin 1 increased N-cadherin and vimentin, two important members of EMT. While treatment with ISO in T24T wildtype cells decreased N-cadherin and vimentin, ISO did not have any effect on N-cadherin or vimentin in T24T cells with Sestrin 2 or Beclin 1 knockdown. Furthermore, ISO treatment reduced protein levels of Atg7 and Bcl-2 in T24T wildtype cells. ISO failed to decrease Atg7 and Bcl-2 in those T24T cells with Sestrin 2 or Beclin 1 knockdown. The present study suggested that ISO inhibits migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells and the inhibition of ISO is dependent on Sestrin 2 and Beclin 1, and induction of autophagy by ISO reduces migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells. The present study provides evidence that ISO can be a candidate of chemotherapy.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5ac22937-c5fa-4e13-aa53-378e775a1599\/@r03B8ZTB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Sestrin 2,Beclin 1,Migration\/Invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18384"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zhuo Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingxia Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Huailu Tu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Max Costa<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, due to a scarcity of CTC among the millions of nucleated blood cells, there is an unmet need to improve CTC assays. <i><u>Acoustophoresis<\/u><\/i> uses standing ultrasound waves in a flow-through microfluidic chamber to discriminate cells based on the size, density, and compressibility. The technique is label-free as opposed to assays that rely on the cell surface marker EpCAM to detect CTCs. We will use label-free two-step acoustophoresis method as the initial separation step followed by a density medium purging step, to obtain efficient recovery of CTC of very high purity.<br \/>Experimental procedure:<i> <\/i>Acoustic cell separation of CTCs from blood is challenging in reference to overlap of acoustic properties between small-sized CTCs and densely granular WBC. To obtain high recovery of CTC, we must apply a sufficiently large acoustic focusing amplitude which leads to a contaminating cell population comprising 2% white blood cells, (WBCs) that mainly contain eosinophil cells. To obtain high purity cancer cell fractions there is a critical need for an additional cleaning step. Therefore, we used the density medium iodixanol in a purging step where the optimal iodixanol medium concentration is intended to provide one cell type with positive, and the other with negative acoustic contrast.<br \/>Preliminary results: show that the granulocytes can be transferred by the ultrasound field into the high-density medium (iodixanol) and can thereby be removed through a first outlet. The cancer cells do not transfer into the iodixanol medium and will be collected in a pure PCa cell fraction in the low-density medium through a second outlet<i>.<\/i> The samples were processed at a flow rate of 75 &#956;l\/min. The limiting factor regarding flow rate when purging the sample from granulocytes is overheating caused by the ultrasound transducer. The separation efficiency for cancer cells was 99.5% with 2.2% contaminating granulocytes. Theoretically, by combining the two separation steps only 0,044% of the WBC would remain in the cancer cell fraction.<br \/>Conclusion: It is unclear which are the functional properties that enable a primary tumor to shed CTCs, and comprehensive characterization is urgently needed to identify key features of these processes. CTC fractions of high purity will enable single cell analysis with validated Fluidigm-based RT-PCR panels, mass spectrometry, and RNA-sequencing. We propose to use a two-step acoustic separation method, with a primary acoustic separation step and a second high-density medium purging step.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d314e17d-58f1-4988-b6a8-72b85795e0c3\/@r03B8ZTB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,microfluidics,Metastasis,acoustofluidics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18901"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cecilia Magnusson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahdi Rezayati Charan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hans Lilja<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Per Augustsson<\/i><\/presenter>.

According to the prognostic model by Sonpavde et. al, post platinum treated mUC pts with liver metastasis had a 50% higher risk of death on immunotherapy compared to pts without liver metastasis (PMID 32552295). Herein, we hypothesize that pts with liver metastasis harbor a distinct tumor genomic landscape compared to pts without liver metastasis.<br \/>Methods: In this IRB-approved retrospective study, mUC pts with and without liver metastasis at baseline and available tumor comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) from a CLIA-certified laboratory were included. Variants of unknown significance and mutated genes present in &#8804; 5% of pts were excluded. A Chi-square test was used to compare the frequency of mutated genes between both groups. The p-value was adjusted for false discovery, significance was preset at 0.25.<br \/>Results: 114 pts were included. 16\/114 pts had a liver metastasis. Median age was 69 and 67 years, male\/female 12\/4 and 72\/26, smokers\/non-smokers 6\/10 and 46\/52, for pts with and without liver metastasis respectively. The most frequent genomic alterations (GAs) were seen in <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>CDKN2B <\/i>and <i>FGFR3<\/i>. Pts with liver metastasis had significantly higher GAs in <i>MYC<\/i> (unadjusted p=0.009, adjusted p=0.24) compared to pts without liver metastasis. The median number of GAs per patient and the tumor mutation burden were not significantly different between groups.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results indicate GAs in <i>MYC<\/i> are significantly enriched in pts with liver metastasis compared to those without liver metastasis.

However, currently liquid biopsy is mostly focused on analyzing cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Though analyzing RNA provides more accurate analysis for functional gene fusions, little is known about the stability and availability of cfRNA (cell free RNA). Here we report our one-tube robust cfTNA (cell free total nucleic acids) assay to analyze ctDNA and ctRNA simultaneously.<br \/>Methods: We assessed Pillar&#8217;s cell free TNA panel performance on 2 confirmed fusion positive and 5 fusion negative samples that were serially diluted to obtain a total of 88 samples including replicates. An input of 10ng cfTNA was used for fusion positive samples with fusion frequency ranging from 0.2% to 20%. A range of 5 to 30ng input was used for fusion negative samples. The amount of input cfRNA was estimated as equal to the cfDNA input. Total nucleic acids were extracted and cfRNA was reverse transcribed. Amplicons targeted the specific breakpoints of 36 known fusion transcripts. Fusion positive samples were diluted for library prep to achieve fusion frequency of 0.5%, 1%, 4%, 5% and 20%. Novaseq was used for sequencing with an average depth of 200,000X and downsampled by 25%.

While recent studies have demonstrated a critical role of tumour cell CCDC25-ILK complex in promoting NET-DNA-induced tumour metastasis in breast cancer, here we have investigated the presence and function of NETosis-induced CCDC25-ILK signaling in the context of pancreatic cancer. We demonstrate that CCDC25 and ILK are expressed in human PDAC cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines and in cell lines derived from the KPCY genetic model of PDAC. Importantly, co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that endogenous CCDC25 and ILK interact in PDAC cells, and the addition of neutrophil-derived NET-DNA resulted in a greater amount of ILK associated with CCDC25 and in increased wound-induced migration. Time-lapse imaging demonstrated a dramatic effect of inhibition of ILK activity on NET-DNA-induced migration by tumour cells in vitro. In vivo, co-localization of CCDC25 and ILK was observed in tumours and liver metastases from both the KPCY GEMM and the MIA PaCa-2 human PDAC xenograft models that were stained by multispectral immunofluorescence for these markers and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Similarly, both tumours and liver metastases showed the presence of infiltrating neutrophils and NETs as indicated by staining for myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histone H3. Collectively, these data identify the neutrophil extracellular trap-induced CCDC25-ILK interaction as an important contributor to PDAC progression and suggest the potential for targeting this axis to prevent NET-induced PDAC progression and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/50f6b2a3-bea9-4fb9-8a07-997cf0ebb0ce\/@s03B8ZTC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Migration,Metastasis,NET-DNA,signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18904"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul C.

Literature review suggests that Prx4 upregulation in colorectal cancer is associated with higher tumor metastasis and shorter survival of patients. However, the function and mechanisms of Prx4 in cancer development are not well understood. The goal of this study is to validate the oncogenic role of Prx4 and to identify potential mechanisms of invasion and metastasis. Western Blot was performed to compare the expression of Prx4 protein in a normal colon cell line and seven colorectal cancer cell lines. shRNA mediated knockdown of Prx4 was performed in cancer cell lines with higher expression of Prx4. Stable vector control and Prx4 knockdown cells were used to perform Scratch Wound healing assay to compare the rate of migration. Transwell Matrigel invasion assay was performed using the same cell lines with 10% FBS containing-medium as chemoattractant. Vector control and Prx4 knockdown HCT116 cells were orthotopically implanted into the cecum wall of immunodeficient mice and humanely euthanized four weeks later. Prx4 expression is upregulated in colorectal cancer cell lines compared to normal colon cell line NCM356. Stable knockdown of Prx4 in HCT116 and RKO cell lines resulted in a significant decrease in migration and invasion rates of cancer cell lines <i>in vitro <\/i>compared to vector control. Orthotopic implantation of HCT116 vector control and Prx4 knockdown cells into cecum wall resulted in a lower metastasis rate to the liver and the lungs. We are currently conducting mechanistic studies to determine how the loss of Prx4 leads to a decrease in malignancy of colorectal cancer cell lines. Prx4 promotes colorectal cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Our study suggests Prx4 is a critical oncogenic protein that can be used as a therapeutic target for patients.

The molecular mechanisms that drive bone metastatic PCa are not well understood. Recent reports have increasingly shed light on the role of cancer-cell-derived extracellular vesicles (exosomes) in driving the metastatic cascade including priming the secondary site for metastatic manifestation. We have previously reported that TBX2 promotes multiple facets of the PCa bone metastatic cascade via a cell-intrinsic manner. In this study, we sought to determine if the bone metastasis promoted by TBX2 is driven by microRNAs (miRs) in an exosome-mediated paracrine manner.<br \/>Methods: Two converse approaches were utilized for the genetic modulation of TBX2: <i>a)<\/i> TBX2 was blocked in the metastatic PC3 and C4-2B human PCa cells using a dominant negative (DN) approach, and <i>b)<\/i> TBX2 was over-expressed in the low-TBX2 expressing LNCaP human PCa cells. Exosomes isolated from TBX2-modulated human PCa cells were added to MC3T3 pre-osteoblastic cells or mouse calvaria bone cells to examine the differential effects of TBX2 modulation on osteoblast or osteoclast differentiation. Next, unbiased next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to identify the differential miR expression in exosomes derived from the TBX2-blocked PC3 cells.<br \/>Results: Our results demonstrate that compared with control exosomes, exosomes derived from TBX2-blocked PC3 cells slowed the proliferation and migration\/wound healing when added to 22Rv1 cells. Further, compared with control exosomes, exosomes derived from TBX2-blocked C4-2B cells resulted in reduced osteoblast differentiation when added to: <i>a)<\/i> MC3T3 pre-osteoblastic cells, or <i>b)<\/i> mouse calvaria bone cells. Along similar lines, when compared with the control exosomes, exosomes derived from TBX2-blocked PC3 and C4-2B cells resulted in reduced osteoclast differentiation when added to bone-marrow derived cells. These results were confirmed by q RT-PCR analysis of the osteoblastic\/osteolytic bone markers. In order to identify exosomal miRs downstream of TBX2 signaling, NGS analysis of exosomal miRs obtained from TBX2-blocked PC3 human PCa cells identified miR-375-3p as the top-most differentially-expressed (over-expressed miR) when compared with control exosomes. <i>In silico<\/i> analysis revealed that miR-375-3p could potentially bind and target the 3&#8217;UTR of RBPJ, an established driver of PCa bone metastasis. In agreement, q RT-PCR analysis revealed that rescue of miR-375-3p in TBX2 modulated human PCa cells rescued RBPJ expression.<br \/>Conclusions: Our studies have identified the exosome-mediated TBX2\/miR-375-3p\/RBPJ signaling axis as a promoter of the bone-metastatic phenotype in human PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c80d0a6-9b77-4a0e-ad5a-001636ae9a6f\/@s03B8ZTC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-10 Premetastatic niche,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Extracellular vesicles,Bone metastasis,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18906"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Girijesh Kumar Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sayanika Dutta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hamed Khedmatgozar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manisha Tripathi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Srinivas Nandana<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Tumor-derived factors (TDF) induce pathological changes in distant organ niches that render these organs more receptive to colonization by disseminated tumor cells. This process, termed premetastatic niche (PMN) cultivation, is characterized in part by pathological activation of stromal cells and induction acute extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. There is an urgent and unmet need for models of PMN cultivation in human cancers to accelerate the discovery of mechanisms and develop PMN-targeting therapies. We engineered 3D culture models of aggressive carcinoma and quiescent organ interstitium and integrated them in a millifluidic device that enables interconnected coculture. Our devices are engineered for ease of adoption by labs with experience culturing cells and organoids in 3D hydrogels. Cultures can be performed in static, with continuous gravity-driven flow, or with a rocker for recirculating flow. Here we present a form of the model in which a patient-derived triple negative breast cancer microenvironment is linked with a quiescent lung interstitium. Fibroblast activation and ECM synthesis indicative of PMN cultivation are quantified relative to a physiological resting state. All device cultures were maintained with fibroblast growth medium containing 0.1% FBS and 1% ITS which maintains the lung compartment in a quiescent state in the absence of endogenous activating factors in the system. The TME compartment in our devices exhibited features of aggressive cancers after 7 days of culture including widespread 3D invasion of tumor cells and formation of a dense stroma comprised of myofibroblast-like CAF with prominent smooth muscle actin (SMA) cytoskeleton and nuclear translocation of activated Yes-associated protein 1 (aYAP1). These cellular features of the engineered tumor microenvironment were accompanied by a dense anisotropic matrix of newly-synthesized fibronectin. TNBC-derived factors transported in the system induced PMN cultivation in the lung compartment by 7 days, as evidenced by quantitative increases in focal deposition of fibronectin and a spectrum of activated phenotypes defined by SMA and aYAP1 expression patterns in previously quiescent fibroblasts. Thus, we have captured cancer-induced changes in the density and architecture of newly-synthesized ECM in a distant tissue that would support tumor cell adhesion.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a47bc410-03b3-43a8-b049-0002e7d73d1b\/@s03B8ZTC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-10 Premetastatic niche,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Premetastatic niche,Stromal-epithelial interactions,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18907"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elisabet A.

This disease is the cause of most cancer death among Puerto Rican men, representing 18.9% of overall cancer deaths. However, a patient outcome depends on the type of tumor, which can be indolent or aggressive. The indolent PCa is of slow tumor growth and favorable prognosis, whereas the aggressive form is of rapid tumor spread and high mortality. The discrimination between the indolent and aggressive forms of PCa has resulted in a significant problem of overtreating those patients with the indolent form of the disease. Thus, biomarkers that aid in the decision-making process regarding active surveillance in very low-, low-, and favorable intermediate-risk PCa face a large unmet need. For this purpose, we evaluate the expression of phospho-Rb S249 and epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, B-catenin) to create a combination that can help distinguish between the indolent and aggressive forms of PCa. We hypothesize that the biomarkers E-cadherin, and B-catenin could be useful to identify indolence among PCa patients, whereas phospho-Rb S249 and N-cadherin could identify the aggressive form of the disease. As part of our methodology, we have conducted immunohistochemistry (N=182) against the expression of these biomarkers on PCa tumor microarrays (TMA&#8217;s). Correlation coefficient analyses were conducted to assess if the expression of these biomarkers could correlate with any of the patient&#8217;s clinical parameters (stage, grade, tumor size, lymph nodes metastasis, metastasis to distant sites, Gleason score, and Gleason grade). In addition, we created a linear regression analysis to determine if the combined proteins could precisely predict the staging, grade, or Gleason score of the patients. Results have shown that the combination of phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and B-catenin had a precision of 68% correctly predicting the staging of the patients, and adding the tumor size, lymph nodes metastasis, and metastasis to distant sites to the equation increased the prediction to a 96%. Additionally, we identified that E-cadherin and B-catenin negatively correlated with the tumor size, grade, stage, Gleason grade, and Gleason score of the patients. Whereas N-cadherin and phospho-Rb S249 positively correlate with the tumor size, stage, and Gleason grade. These results suggest that the expression of phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and B-catenin could be used as a potential tool to discriminate between the indolent and aggressive forms of PCa. This will contribute to enhancing the clinical decision of which patients should be treated or undergo active surveillance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/201799a8-7daf-4ad5-af40-f917ec041639\/@s03B8ZTC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Biomarkers,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Retinoblastoma protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18908"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sheila M.

Interestingly, recent evidence has also suggested that the mechanical response of cancer cells is intimately related to their pathological state. Physically, a reduced modulus will make it easier for cancer cells to change their morphology when squeezing through tight endothelial cell-cell junctions or pores in the extracellular matrix. However, the deformed cell will fully restore to its original shape if the response is purely elastic or viscoelastic. In this regard, the capability of cells to retain irreversible deformations, and hence effectively &#8220;memorize&#8221; the characteristics of the physical confinement that they have encountered, could greatly facilitate their subsequent passage through similar barriers, which is a common scenario in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Here, we developed a method, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, to quantitatively measure the apparent plastic response of tumor cells and examine its correlation with their invasiveness.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> A microfluidic device was designed to deform the cell and then extract its viscoelastic and plastic characteristics from its shape recovery. The chip was casted by molding of silicon wafer which was fabricated using photo etching method. During the test, cells were pushed to squeeze through the deformation channel of the chip. Deformations of the cell and its nucleus were monitored under a fluorescent microscope. Two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), one nasopharyngeal cell line (NP69), and one carcinoma counterpart (HONE-1) were used. To verify the correlation of plastic response with cytoskeleton damage, Latrunculin A was added to block F-actin formation. SYTO fluorescent dye was used for live imaging of the cell nucleus.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> After being deformed in the narrow channel for a few seconds, cells were released free and recovered the deformation. Interestingly, the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 and HONE-1 cells underwent irreversible deformation even after 10 minutes. However, NP69 and the poorly invasive MCF-7 cells fully recovered to the original round shape in a few minutes. But after blocking the F-actin formation with Latrunculin A, MCF-7 cells retained partial plastic strain. The nucleus elongated when the cell deformed, but fully recovered in 5 minutes. The results indicated the irreversible deformation of cells originated from cytoskeleton damage, but not the nucleus deformation.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> No apparent irreversible deformation was observed in the less invasive cell lines, suggesting that the plastic response of tumor cells might be correlated with their invasiveness. In addition, it was found that the plastic deformation of highly invasive cancer cells is caused by their cytoskeleton damage rather than plasticity of the nucleus.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ecabc7bd-8008-4aab-8d47-3658a052a1cd\/@s03B8ZTC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer cell,Deformation,Invasiveness,Plastic response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18909"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xingyu Xia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zishen Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>William C.

However, the estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-positive (ER-\/PR+) subtype does not receive the benefits of tamoxifen. Therefore ER-\/PR+ breast cancer have a poor clinical outcome, but drug development for ER-\/PR+ breast cancer is not well studied. Here, we found that gene expression in ER-\/PR+ HR+ breast cancer is positively related to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and not HR+ breast cancer using 4,319 breast cancer patients database. Especially, inflammation-related genes, A20\/TNFAIP3, CDC20 and CASP1\/Caspase-1, which are highly expressed in TNBC, are also upregulated in ER-\/PR+ HR+ breast cancer. Suppression of A20\/TNFAIP3, CDC20 and CASP1 inhibit cancer cell growth and metastasis in ER&#945; KO (ER-\/PR+) cell lines. Interestingly, loss of ER&#945; in HR+ cell lines is not responsive to tamoxifen, but highly sensitive to inflammation inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO. In in vitro and ex vivo models, inflammation inhibitor specifically blocks ER-\/PR+ tumor proliferation and migration. These findings suggest that the inflammation inhibitor might be the first potential target therapy for ER-\/PR+ HR breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7bd95458-b995-4647-92b3-89bd53e5ad24\/@s03B8ZTC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Inflammation,Metastasis,Estrogen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19046"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chaeun (Christine) Song<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Val J.

In addition, in some circumstances, they produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which is unfolded DNA fibers showing such a web-like structure containing histone and various proteins. However, recent studies have suggested NETs can promote tumor metastasis. In fact, many neutrophils are infiltrating in tumor tissues which are called tumor associated neutrophils (TAN) and high TANs are associated with poor prognosis. However, the detailed effects of TAN on tumor cell behavior are still not fully understood.<br \/>Methods: Human peripheral polymorph neutrophils (PMN) collected from healthy donor were stimulated with 1&#956;M PMA or 10&#956;g\/ml LPS for 15 min, washed extensively, and incubated for another 3 hours. Using trans-well system with culture inserts with 8&#956;m pore membrane, we examined the migration of human gastric cancer cells NUGC-4 or MKN45 to 2% FBS placed in lower chamber with or without PMN. Random migration was also examined with time-lapsed analysis. Lamellipodia were detected with F-actin stained with phalloidin-488 and immunostaining to vinculin.<br \/>Results: PMN stimulated with either PMA or LPS produced large amounts of NETs stained with SYTOX. NUGC-4 and MKN45 showed little migration to unstimulated PMN, while many cells did migrate when PMA-activated PMN were present in lower chamber. Although NET-depleted supernatants (SN) also induced significant migration, the number of migrated cells was reduced to about 50%. When catalase (800U\/ml) catalase was added, the migrations of NUGC-4 was significantly reduced (37%). Random migration was markedly enhanced by NET-depleted SN. Addition of the SN induced many lamellipodia in NUGC-4 within 30 min. The migration of NUGC-4 was also increased by PMN stimulated by LPS, but not by their NET-depleted SN.<br \/>Summary and Conclusion: PMA-stimulated neutrophils induce robust migration of cancer cells which is partly dependent on H2O2. LPS-stimulated neutrophils appear to produce less amounts of ROS, but can also enhance the NUGC-4 migration through NET dependent manner. Activated neutrophils in tumor microenvironment can stimulate migration of cancer cells through multiple mechanisms, and assist the initial step of metastatic process of primary tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1504c9b5-c3ff-4f98-bc98-fc229afc9c5b\/@s03B8ZTC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuropilins,Gastric cancer,Reactive oxygen species,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21076"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kazuya Takahashi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideyuki Ohzawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Kaneko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yurie Futoh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kohei Tamura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Kimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akira Saito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mineyuki Tojo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rihito Kanamaru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideyo Miyato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naohiro Sata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joji Kitayama<\/i><\/presenter>.

We used siRNA to inhibit CD44 expression and realized RT-qPCR, western blot, flow cytometry analyzes and promoter reporter assays to monitor regulations of our gene of interest. Furthermore, we realized <i>in vitro<\/i> clotting assays and TF activity assays to examine coagulant properties, and <i>in vivo<\/i> experimental metastasis assays to assess early metastatic potential. We first confirmed by WB, RT-qPCR and FACS analyzes that CD44 is over-expressed in our EMT<sup>+<\/sup> and EMT-induced (EMTi) cellular models, concomitantly with TF expression. Using siRNAs, we showed that CD44 silencing in these same EMT+ and EMTi cellular models decreased both mRNA and protein levels of TF. Clotting assays and TF activity assays further showed that CD44 silencing decreased pro-coagulant properties of our EMT+ and EMTi cellular models <i>in vitro<\/i> and of their pro-metastatic properties <i>in vivo<\/i>. Examining further the molecular mechanisms of TF regulation by CD44, we employed truncated TF promoter reporter vectors to identify key transcription factors linking CD44 to TF transcription. These experiments revealed that a TF promoter region containing Sp1 binding sites is sufficient to mediate the diminution of TF promoter activity seen after CD44 silencing. Mutations in the Sp1 binding sites abrogated the activity of the TF reporter vector. Further pointing to Sp1 as a key transcription factor implicated in TF regulation by CD44, we observed that silencing CD44 inhibited Sp1 expression and that silencing Sp1 decreased TF mRNA levels. Our results thus demonstrate a key role of CD44 in regulating TF expression in EMT+ cancer cells, and point to Sp1 as a transcriptional mediator of this regulation. This modulation of TF expression by CD44 in EMT+ cells led to a concomitant regulation of pro-coagulant properties, and impacts metastatic potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/830519f5-d2fb-4ce9-af21-7104719b9836\/@t03B8ZTD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Tissue factor,CD44,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21372"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"ed0e6305-03f8-4f05-865e-5c6b82908f4d","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed0e6305-03f8-4f05-865e-5c6b82908f4d\/@t03B8ZTD\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amélie V.

Our group previously reported that brain tumor microenvironment (TME)-mediated <i>PTEN<\/i> downregulation in brain metastatic tumor cells increases the secretion of the chemokine CCL2, which enhances the infiltration of CCR2<sup>+<\/sup> bone marrow derived myeloid cells, eventually promoting brain metastasis outgrowth. However, the mechanism of CCL2-CCR2 axis promoting brain metastasis is not clear, and the efficacy of targeting either CCR2 or CCL2 remained to be assessed. Here we show that Ccr2 antagonism significantly blocked Ccr2<sup>high<\/sup> myeloid cells trafficking in the blood and infiltration into the brain TME. However, Ccr2 antagonism did not sufficiently impede breast cancer brain metastasis in multiple preclinical models. Nevertheless, knocking down CCL2 or targeting CCL2 exhibited significant inhibition of brain metastasis growth. Subsequent analysis of the brain TME through mass cytometry demonstrated dramatically decreased infiltration of both Ccr2<sup>high<\/sup> and Ccr2<sup>low<\/sup> myeloid cell populations in the CCL2 targeted group, implying that the Ccr2<sup>low<\/sup> myeloid cells are also involved in promoting brain metastasis growth. Our data highlights the differential responses between targeting CCR2 or CCL2 in multiple preclinical brain metastasis models, which direct us to explore the function of Ccr2<sup>low<\/sup> myeloid cells in regulating brain metastasis progression. Our findings also suggest that carefully choosing between CCR2 or CCL2 as a target to control brain metastasis is important in clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82ee062d-9f9b-4c2f-a672-c51be0fefd31\/@t03B8ZTD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Breast cancer,Immune cells,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21478"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yimin Duan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yutao Qi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangliang Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dihua Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

The aggressiveness of GBM and OC during recurrence creates a need to identify potential therapeutic targets. The cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotype and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been shown to contribute to cancer aggressiveness, which makes CSCs and EMT viable targets for therapeutic intervention. EMT is a normal process during development and wound healing, but its reactivation in cancer cells contributes to metastasis. To detect CSC phenotypes in live cells without the use of antibodies, we are analyzing core stem cell transcription factors in which a SOX2\/OCT4 response element, designated as SORE6, regulates a GFP reporter system. Also, to detect EMT we are using a GFP based reporter regulated by Zeb1 3&#8217; UTR, a common EMT marker. Our aim is to detect changes in stemness and EMT in response to proton and photon ionizing radiation (IR). We hypothesize that proton and photon IR have similar effects on aggressiveness in OC and GBM. To investigate this, 2 GBM cancer cell lines, 1 breast cancer cell line, 1 OC cell line, and two patient derived samples were exposed to 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy of 250 MeV proton and 6 MeV photon beams. 72 hours post IR exposure, flow cytometry analysis quantified reporter activity. We found an increase in stemness as radiation dosage increased in most cell lines. Results suggest that proton radiation increases stemness more than photon exposure.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cell,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Radiation,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21710"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aaron Keniston<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alondra Enciso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeonkyu Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Antonissen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Fuller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ann Morcos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonella Bertucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcello Vazquez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juli Unternaehrer<\/i><\/presenter>.
