[{"Abstract":"Mucin 1 (MUC1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are co-expressed at high prevalence in multiple cancer indications such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Tumor-associated MUC1 is hypoglycosylated and exposes peptide epitopes within its extracellular domain, which are not accessible to antibodies in normal epithelial tissue. MUC1 co-localizes with EGFR as a result of loss of cell polarity in tumor cells. M1231 is a bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) based on a SEED (strand-exchange engineered domain)-antibody scaffold targeting tumor-associated MUC1 and EGFR. Sutro Biopharma&#8217;s cell free expression system Xpress CF+&#8482; enables incorporation of non-natural amino acids at precise positions in the SEED-antibody for site-specific linker-payload conjugation. The cytotoxic payload of M1231 (SC209) is a hemiasterlin-related microtubule inhibitor. The cleavable linker (ValCit-PABA) maintained ADC stability in human plasma in vitro, ensuring low systemic payload release. Pre-clinical activity of M1231 was assessed in vitro in cancer cell lines and in vivo in NSCLC and ESCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. M1231 inhibited tumor cell viability in vitro at sub-nanomolar IC50 values. The bispecific MUC1xEGFR antibody has demonstrated superior internalization and lysosomal trafficking compared to monospecific bivalent antibodies. Efficient ADC uptake resulted in superior antitumor activity of M1231 in PDX models compared to monospecific bivalent ADCs. M1231 demonstrated durable and dose-dependent antitumor activity in PDX models. Strong antitumor activity with complete regression was observed in NSCLC and ESCC PDX models following a single treatment of M1231. M1231 antitumor activity was associated with high target expression in NSCLC PDX models and was observed across a range of target expression levels in ESCC models. In summary, efficient payload delivery to tumor cells and strong antitumor activity of M1231 indicate that M1231 may have the potential to deliver an efficacy benefit to patients with tumors co-expressing MUC1 and EGFR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7503dedd-ef16-4c55-9b99-1ed69aea3557\/@o03B8ZRG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-01 Antireceptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),MUC1,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17699"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c0f811ee-e367-4c56-b966-5905b3203d51","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0f811ee-e367-4c56-b966-5905b3203d51\/@o03B8ZRG\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christine Knuehl<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Toleikis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Dotterweich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianguo Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seema Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edith Ross<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Wilm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Schmitt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hans Juergen Grote<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christiane Amendt<\/i><\/presenter>. the healthcare business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, EMD Serono R&D Institute, Billerica, MA, EMD Serono R&D Institute, Billerica, MA, the healthcare business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, the healthcare business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"72c66cf3-2c89-4767-9225-be858ebc0c8b","ControlNumber":"3011","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

Among them, MIBC has been recognized as hard to treatment type of cancer for many decades. Therefore, to develop a new treatment strategy for MIBC is urgently needed. Transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#954;B) plays important role in various cancer progression, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and MIBC. Thus, NF-&#954;B may be a potential target to suppress the progression of MIBC. Fluoxetine is FDA approval antidepressant agent, belongs to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Interestingly, recent study indicated that Fluoxetine inhibited NF-&#954;B and induced apoptosis in the HCC both <i>in vivo <\/i>and<i> in vitro<\/i>. However, whether Fluoxetine may regulate NF-&#954;B and inhibit MIBC tumor progression is remaining unknown. Therefore, the aim of present study is to verify the treatment efficacy and underlying mechanism of fluoxetine on MIBC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Human MIBC cells TSGH8301 and T24 cells and mice bearing with MIBC MB49 cells was used in this study. Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and metastasis ability of cells after fluoxetine treatment was validated through MTT assay, cleaved caspase-3, -8, -9 activation using flow cytometry and transwell migration\/invasion assay, respectively. In <i>in vivo<\/i> study murine MB49 cells were subcutaneous inoculated into right flank of C57B6\/J mice and treated with fluoxetine for 15 days.<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> Fluoxetine markedly induced cytotoxicity, cleaved caspase-3, -8, -9 expression, and inhibited migration and invasion in both TSGH8301 and T24 cells. Western blotting and reporter gene assay indicated that fluoxetine may suppress the phosphorylation and activity of NF-&#954;B. In <i>in vivo <\/i>results<i>, <\/i>fluoxetine inhibited tumor growth and the expression of NF-&#954;B within tumor. Tumor immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining results proved that the apoptosis marker such as Caspase-3, -8, -9 were all increased by fluoxetine. AST and ALT value that represent as liver function showed no significant difference between vehicle group and fluoxetine treatment group. Body weight and H&#38;E results also proved the safety of fluoxetine usage.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Fluoxetine induced cytotoxicity via both extrinsic\/intrinsic apoptotic pathway and inhibited metastasis ability as well. Fluoxetine may also suppress the phosphorylation and activity NF-&#954;B <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In sum, we suggested that fluoxetine may effectively suppress tumor progression via inactivate NF-&#954;B signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79db146c-cd7c-45a0-92b1-ee02062e36f9\/@o03B8ZRG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-02 Apoptosis: Therapeutic manipulation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Fluoxetine,NF-&#954;B,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17700"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhao-Lin Tan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>I-Tsang Chiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei-Ting Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei-Ting Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>.

The anti-ROS1 fusion gene is a successful therapeutic target with a 72% objective response rate in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC patients. However, it has yet to be determined whether wild-type ROS1 plays a role in cancer development or could serve as a therapeutic target as its ligand was unknown. Our study unexpectedly identified that RNase7, a RNase superfamily protein, is specifically pulled down by ROS1 and acts as a ROS1 ligand. In HCC patient-derived xenograft and an orthotopic mouse model of HCC, we found that crizotinib, an FDA-approved ROS1 inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-tumor activity in the mice harboring RNase7-expressing tumors. In addition, clinical data analysis indicated that ROS1 and RNase7 co-expression occurs in about 30% of HCC patients and is highly correlated with poorer survival. The plasma level of RNase7 is positively correlated with phosphorylated ROS1 in HCC patients. Our current report provides a rationale to choose RNase7 as a potential plasma biomarker to stratify HCC patients for anti-ROS1 targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/91609af2-7693-4245-9fa9-24a2266c890f\/@o03B8ZRG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Biomarkers,ROS1,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17701"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chunxiao Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengyu Zha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chenhao Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dihua Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ning Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mien-Chien Hung<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, patients treated with trastuzumab generally develop resistance to the drug within a year after initiation of the treatment. Pertuzumab, another anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody developed by Roche, targets the domain 2 of the HER2 excellular domain (ECD) instead of the domain 4 to which trastuzumab binds and demonstrates enhanced antitumor activities when combined with trastuzumab. Here, we developed a tetravalent bispecific antibody (BsAb) which targets the domain 2 and 4 of the HER2 ECD simultaneously. Using time-lapse microscopy, we showed that the BsAb induced aggregation of HER2 on NCI-N87 tumor cells, possibly indicating that the receptors could be crosslinked by the BsAb intermolecularly. Furthermore, the tetravalent BsAb induced aggregation faster than did the bivalent BsAb. Importantly, the tetravalent BsAbs exhibited superior tumor cell growth inhibition to that of the two parental monoclonal antibodies alone or combined. In line with the aggregation rates, the tetravalent BsAb was also more potent in inhibiting tumor cell growth than that of the bivalent BsAb. Thus we provide a piece of evidence that the BsAbs targeting two distinct domains of HER2 simultaneously might induce the receptor aggregation which might associate with the enhanced inhibition of tumor cell growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8945a752-f4f4-48a8-9e8b-9bef4f7b68e4\/@p03B8ZRH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,HER2\/neu,Bispecific antibody,Antitumor activity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17702"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lan Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoqing Meng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aotian Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenping Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Haomin Huang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

It serves as a major barrier against malignant transformation and the p53 pathway is inactivated in almost all human tumors. A large percentage of tumors inactivate p53 by point mutations in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the protein. Most mutations destabilize p53 protein folding, causing its partial denaturation at physiological temperature. Thus a high proportion of human tumors overexpress a potential potent tumor suppressor in a non-functional, improperly folded form. Previously, we reported the use of phage display technology to select for peptides that reactivate mutant p53 by stabilizing a wt protein conformation, taking advantage of a unique combination of selection steps (Tal P, at al Oncotarget. 2017 Jan 3;8(1):164-178). We now describe further progress in the development of one lead peptide, pCAP-250, which contains 9 amino acids and a myristic fatty acid at its N-terminus. The pCAP-250 sequence bears 100% homology to RAD9, a known p53 interacting protein. We show physical interaction between pCAP-250 and the p53DBD. Characterization of this interaction by NMR reveals a significant chemical shift of amino acids located in the p53DBD L1 loop and Helix-2, two regions critical for p53 transcriptional activity and interaction with DNA. We also report the optimization of our lead sequence by rational design to yield more potent derivatives with higher efficacy in cancer cell elimination and longer in vivo half-life. RNA-seq analysis shows that our lead peptides induce robust activation of p53 target genes. Furthermore, we report that in addition to p53 activation, pCAP-250 also has a p53-independent anti-cancer activity. Overall, our lead peptides cause specific cell death in a wide spectrum of mutant p53 expressing cell lines, with an IC50 of 0.1-12&#181;M, while having no effect on non-transformed cells at these concentrations. The pharmacokinetic profile of pCAP-250 and its derivatives shows that they are completely stable in human serum and have plasma half-life of 1.5-10h in vivo when administered IV or subcutaneously, presumably due to interaction with albumin through the fatty acid moiety. Remarkably, our lead peptides elicit remarkable regression of very aggressive tumors in several preclinical mouse models of renal, colon, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. In vivo efficacy can be achieved through several routes of administration, including intra-tumor injection as well as systemic subcutaneous continuous slow release and subcutaneous bi-daily injections. Thus, such peptides might serve as novel therapeutic agents for p53-mutated human cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/39008550-f498-41dc-8642-426183ac15a6\/@p03B8ZRH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Phage display,Peptides,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17703"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Perry Tal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moshe Oren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Orna Palgi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Varda Rotter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>KWANGIL JEONG<\/i><\/presenter>.

Lacking effective treatment leads to a poor prognosis for advanced iCCA so new targeted therapy is warranted. Impaired wild-type (WT) p53 tumor suppressor function by its negative regulators frequently occurs in iCCA. Therefore, restoration of WT p53 function by inhibiting its negative regulators is a therapeutic strategy being explored for cancer treatment. Both MDM2 inhibitor (MDM2i, RG7388) stabilizing p53 and WIP1 inhibitor (WIP1i, GSK2830371) increasing p53 phosphorylation lead to maximize p53 function. The combination of MDM2i\/WIP1i has been reported in severe cancer types but no in vivo study has been done. In the current study, both liver adenocarcinoma cell lines, RBE and SK-Hep-1, were treated with the RG7388 alone and in combination with GSK2830371. Cell proliferation, clonogenicity, protein and mRNA expressions, and cell cycle distribution were performed to investigate the effect and mechanism of growth suppression. To evaluate the antitumor efficacy of RG7388 and GSK2830371 in vivo, xenografts with SK-Hep-1 cells were treated with combination therapy for two weeks in NOD-SCID mice. The combination of MDM2i and WIP1i significantly increased the growth inhibition, cytotoxic activity, increased p53 protein expression, and phosphorylation (Ser 15), leading to transactivation of downstream targets (p21 and MDM2). The in vivo test demonstrated that the combination treatment can significantly inhibit tumor growth. In this study, liver adenocarcinoma cell lines were inhibited by the combination via reactivation of p53 function evidenced by increased p53 expression, phosphorylation and its downstream targets. This efficacy was also validated by in vivo study. The current research provides a novel strategy for targeting the p53 pathway in liver adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/afa25f58-cb37-4994-b162-a787fd40204c\/@p03B8ZRH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDM2,p53,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17704"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chiao-Ping Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chun-Nan Yeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Ru Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Tien Hsiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Hong Lo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cai-Jhen Jhuang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiao-En Wu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although pertuzumab itself did not exhibit substantial clinical benefit as monotherapy, it was approved to be used in combination with trastuzumab because of its ability to enhance the clinical efficacy of trastuzumab. Currently, the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab is being used as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. However, while the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab has been effective, there is still opportunity for greater effectiveness by identifying anti-HER2 mAbs that will be better synergistic partners of trastuzumab, allowing for better efficacy and\/or broader indications.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A SynAb<sup>TM<\/sup> Platform was used to identify BSI-001, an anti-HER2 mAb, through trastuzumab-based synergistic functional screening. A competitive ELISA was used to perform epitope binning of the anti-HER2 antibodies. BSI-001 was further characterized in combination with trastuzumab for its bioactivity<i> in vitro<\/i>, including inhibition of cell proliferation and antigen-mediated internalization of HER2 positive cell lines. The synergistic effect of BSI-001 with trastuzumab was also evaluated in trastuzumab-resistant cell lines. Multiple animal models were then employed to investigate the synergistic antitumor activity of the combination <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>BSI-001 is the best functional partner of trastuzumab identified through the SynAb<sup>TM<\/sup> platform. BSI-001 binds to a unique epitope, distinct from the binding epitopes of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. It exhibits superior bioactivity and efficacy <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> when combined with trastuzumab. The combination of BSI-001 and trastuzumab inhibits HER2-positive cancer cell growth more potently than that of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. The combination of BSI-001 with trastuzumab also shows inhibition of cell growth of the trastuzumab-resistant cell line BT-474 Clone 5, whereas the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab did not. In addition, BSI-001 is able to synergize with trastuzumab to promote antigen-antibody internalization. In animal models, BSI-001 demonstrates superior synergistic antitumor activity when combined with trastuzumab as compared to pertuzumab.<br \/><b>Summary: <\/b>The combination of BSI-001 and trastuzumab showed significantly better <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> activity than the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. In addition, because of the activity of the BSI-001\/trastuzumab combination in a trastuzumab-resistant cancer cell line, there is the potential for this combination to be used to treat patients with trastuzumab-resistant cancer or patients who experienced relapse following trastuzumab and pertuzumab treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7732857d-511a-4a80-9ba6-da7e720c0e56\/@p03B8ZRH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synergism,Combination therapy,HER2,ErbB2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17705"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shukai Xia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Zeyu Peng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyu Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wanjian Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yujie Zhong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinyu Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyao Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaodong F.

Patients typically present at an advanced stage and less than 50% reach the maximum 1-year survival rate, when given as first-line treatment, Sorafenib. This highlights the need for early detection and novel therapeutic targets crucial to increase overall survival (OS) for patients with HCC. Given the important role of angiogenesis in HCC from its early stage and its rich immune composition, anti-angiogenic and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), are two therapeutic approaches when combined marked the first treatment in more than a decade to significantly improve the overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with advanced HCC compared to Sorafenib. While the combination of agents inhibiting angiogenesis and ICI have recently entered the clinic, the interplay between angiogenic factors and immunity in the context of this approach remains poorly understood. Here we focus on understanding the interplay between the vascular state of the tumor and the immune response in HCC. As a first step, we focus on defining the immune and vasculature landscape of the central tumor, peripheral tumor, adjacent liver to the tumor, and distal liver regions of each lesion by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Forty (40) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human liver tissue samples containing untreated and non-viral HCC tumors, obtained from the Liver Disease Biobank of the RI-MUHC were used to perform IHC. Images were viewed and scored using the Aperio ImageScope software. With respect to the vasculature, we observe that all tumors have a combination of both angiogenic (CD34\/Ki67+ve) and co-optioning (CD31 +ve) features, with no uniform distribution. Our immune markers demonstrate that both adaptive and innate immune cells are present at the interface and different tumors demonstrate different levels of infiltration. Next, to identify the immune subtype populations (ie macrophage M1 vs M2, Treg, etc) present, we will use the NanoString Whole Transcriptome Atlas spatial profiler technology. We will also then link the vasculature to any specific immune profile. For example, it has been shown in other cancer types that macrophages are associated with co-option. This project presents preliminary evidence for the interaction of vascular factors with immune cells, thus providing insight into the biological rationale of why 30% of patients responded to combined angiogenic and immunotherapy treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17791316-8710-4f4c-804a-c139838d95d5\/@p03B8ZRH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Angiogenic factors,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17706"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Audrey Kapelanski-Lamoureux<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Flemming Kondrup<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucyna Krzywon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie K.

Genomically stable gastric cancers (GSGCs) represent 20% of all GCs and GSGC patients have the worst prognosis among all GC subtypes. Although two HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), RC48 and DS8201, have shown promising clinical efficacies, most GSGC patients do not benefit from these ADCs due to the infrequent and heterogeneous HER2 expression. Therefore, there remains a significant and unmet medical need for developing novel ADCs targeting GSGC tumors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this presented study, a quantitative and unbiased approach was first used to identify potential targets for GSGC in a panel of human GSGC cell lines in reference with two normal human gastric epithelial cells. Cell membrane localizations of potential targets on GSGC cell lines were determined by immunofluorescent (IF) staining. To correlate it with clinically-relevant GSGC tumor samples, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of potential targets were performed in human diffuse GC tumor tissues along with normal gastric tissues. Next, GSGC cellular internalization capability of antibodies against potential targets was evaluated. Then, an optimized target was selected for developing GSGC-targeted ADCs. A series of ADC formulations with different linkers and payloads were constructed and characterized. Their anti-tumor activities against GSGC cell lines were subsequently screened in order to identify the optimized ADC formulation. Eventually, the anti-tumor activity and biosafety profile of the optimized ADC formulation were determined in suppressing tumor growth, progression and metastasis by using established orthotopic and peritoneal metastasis models of GSGC.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We first identified CD54 as a potential molecular target for human GSGCs using comparative flow cytometric analysis. We next evaluated its potential as an ADC target for GSGC-targeted therapy by determining its overexpression levels, cell membrane localizations, and cell internalization activity in GSGC cells. Furthermore, we constructed and characterized a panel of CD54-targeted ADCs and identified an optimized ADC formulation by quantitatively determining their half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) and validated its anti-tumor efficacy against GSGC<br \/>tumors.

Overexpression of ANXA1 has been observed in multiple cancers, including triple-negative breast (TNBC), colorectal, lung, pancreatic, gastric and prostate, and correlates with poor prognosis and decreased overall survival. ANXA1 has also been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration and drug resistance, and to modulate the tumor microenvironment. MDX-124 is a novel humanized antibody targeting ANXA1. Previously we presented data demonstrating its significant anti-proliferative activity. Here we provide further data on the mechanism of action of MDX-124, notably its impact on tumor growth, cell cycle arrest and migration in several preclinical cancer models. Incubation of pancreatic (BxPC-3), lung (A549) and TNBC (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines with MDX-124 for 24 h decreased the proportion of cells in S-phase by up to 18.3% with a concomitant increase in G1 phase of up to 33.5% versus untreated cells. This effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner and is consistent with an MDX-124 mediated increase in cell cycle arrest. After 72 h incubation with MDX-124, the migratory ability of gastric (AGS), prostate (PC-3), TNBC (MDA-MB-231), lung (A549), pancreatic (MIA PaCa-2) and colorectal (LoVo) cancer cells was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner when compared to untreated controls. Proteomic analysis following incubation of MDX-124 with a panel of cancer cell lines for 72 h demonstrated substantial alterations in the level of expression and phosphorylation of multiple key oncogenic proteins. In the MycCaP-Bo syngeneic model of bone metastatic prostate cancer, mice treated with the murine analog of MDX-124 (10 mg\/kg, BIW) had a 52% reduction in mean tumor growth after 14 days compared to isotype control treated mice. In conclusion, our data indicate that targeting ANXA1 with MDX-124 inhibits key tumorigenic processes in several clinically challenging cancer indications. MDX-124 therefore provides an innovative approach to cancer therapy. Medannex initiated a First-In-Human study in Q4 2021 to evaluate MDX-124 in solid malignancies known to overexpress ANXA1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6ac38bc1-07dd-4e99-af3b-0fcd7756b189\/@q03B8ZRJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Therapeutics,Cancer therapy,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18649"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fiona C.

Given TTP loss occurs in early prostate cancer we sought to examine the clinical and biological impact of TTP loss combined with PTEN loss, which also occurs in early prostate cancer. IHC revealed an increased risk of relapse with loss of one gene alone and a significantly higher risk of relapse with loss of both TTP and PTEN, (HR 4.50, p=0.04 on MVA adjusting for standard clinicopathologic factors). These findings were confirmed by analysis of RNA profiles of two publicly available prostatectomy series. Engineering <i>ZFP36<\/i> deletion specific to prostate luminal cells <i>in vivo<\/i> induced high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN), and when combined with <i>PTEN<\/i> deletion (P:Z) resulted in rapid progression to invasive adenocarcinoma associated with increased proliferation and development of micrometastases. Combined loss of <i>PTEN <\/i>and <i>ZFP36 <\/i>in mice significantly reduced overall survival (53.4 (P:Z+\/-) and 49.6 (P:Z-\/-) weeks versus 66.9 weeks in PTEN-\/- (p&#60;0.0001). Further, surgical castration of mice demonstrated that combined loss of <i>ZFP36 <\/i>and <i>PTEN <\/i>significantly accelerated progression to castration resistance versus <i>PTEN <\/i>alone (median survival, 56.1 (P:Z+\/-) and 53.9 (P:Z-\/-) weeks versus all <i>PTEN<\/i>-\/- mice still alive by 70 weeks). <i>Ex vivo <\/i>analysis of organoid growth of the tumors revealed presence of budding with PTEN-\/- with ZFP36-\/- and almost none with PTEN-\/-. These findings were recapitulated with GEMM-derived allograft tumor growth with tumor sizes 20 weeks after castration being 200mm<sup>3<\/sup> in PTEN-\/- versus 900mm<sup>3<\/sup> with [PTEN-\/- + TTP-\/-] versus 600mm<sup>3<\/sup> for PTEN-\/- and 1200mm<sup>3<\/sup> for [PTEN-\/- + TTP-\/-] after sham castration (all comparisons p &#60; 0.05). When the PTEN\/ZFP36 null allograft was treated with the NF&#954;B inhibitor dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT, D), tumor sizes 36 days after treatment were: vehicle - 2000mm<sup>3<\/sup>, castration (C) - 1500mm<sup>3<\/sup>; D alone - 600mm<sup>3<\/sup>; C + D - 500mm<sup>3 <\/sup>(all comparisons p&#60;0.05; except D vs C + D; p=0.07). These findings were supported by cell death assays of organoid models for the GEMMs. The hypersensitivity of PTEN\/ZFP36 null cell line to DMAPT was seen with dose response curves with DMAPT LD<sub>50<\/sub> being 4.52 &#956;M PTEN-\/-; 0.76 &#956;M [PTEN -\/- + TTP-\/-] and 8.66 &#956;M for [PTEN-\/- + TTP-\/- + silenced p65]. In conclusion, combined loss of PTEN and TTP results in prostate cancer that is clinically more aggressive than PTEN loss alone and this was corroborated by GEMM models. Namely, PTEN\/TTP null tumors were more aggressive, minimally responsive to castration, demonstrated activation of NF&#954;B and hypersensitivity to DMAPT.

The TME includes tumor cells, stromal cells, immune cells, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix. Senescent cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) may contribute to tumor growth and therapy resistance. Targeting senescent CAF by means of removal, modulation of the SASP, or through cellular reprogramming might provide therapeutic avenues for treating cancer. We investigated the impact of chemotherapy-induced fibroblast senescence in the TME on tumor growth and response to cancer therapy. Expression of cytokines in chemo-induced senescent fibroblasts and cancer cells was assessed by bulk and single cell cytokine profiling. As expected, there were alterations in SASP factors with increased pro-tumorigenic immune factors and decreased anti-tumor cytokines during IMR90 etoposide-induced fibroblast senescence. We co-cultured luciferase-labeled HT29 cancer cells with senescent IMR90 and found that the senescent fibroblasts promoted HT29 cell growth in culture and accelerated xenograft tumor formation in mice. We next inhibited cellular senescence and its SASP with the senolytic drug ABT263 or the senostatic\/senomorphic drug lamivudine (3TC). Both ABT263 and 3TC significantly reduced bioluminescence of HT29-Luc cells co-cultured with senescent IMR90 compared to non-treated IMR90 cells. Therapy-induced senescence confers 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in colorectal cancer. We found that 5-FU treatment significantly reduced colony formation of HT29 cells in the presence of proliferating or senescent IMR90 cells, with a lesser reduction in the presence of the senescent IMR90 cells. This suggests that a microenvironment that includes senescent cells promotes tumor cell resistance to 5-FU. We hypothesize that SASP factors might confer cancer cell resistance to 5-FU treatment. Cytokine profiling showed that TRAIL expression is reduced in senescent cells. Treatment with the TRAIL-inducer ONC201 reduced colony formation and cell viability of HT29 cells co-cultured with senescent IMR90 fibroblasts. Single-cell cytokine profiling showed subpopulations of cancer cells with increased polyfunctionality strength index (PSI, secretion of more than 2 dominant types of cytokines per cell in a population). Combined treatment with ABT263 and ONC201 synergically reduced viability HT29 cells co-cultured with senescent IMR90, and this correlated with reduced PSI. Our results indicate that TME targeting by increasing antitumor cytokines in conjunction with senolytic therapies can inhibit tumor growth. We are continuing to unravel the cytokine landscape of chemotherapy-induced cell senescence to gain insights into therapeutic strategies targeting chemotherapy-induced TME-senescence and drug resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6668cfd2-fe59-414a-80f2-7b6ee3b15d6a\/@q03B8ZRJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,Fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18652"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shengliang Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelsey E.

T-DXd is approved for patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer who have received two or more anti-HER2 based regimens as well as HER2+ gastric cancer, and has demonstrated antitumor activity in both HER2+ and HER2-low cancers clinically. Trapping of Topo1cc by DXd in targeted cells, induces replication stress (RS) and double strand breaks (DSB), activating a DNA Damage Repair (DDR) response. Therefore we aimed to investigate if combination of T-DXd with DDR inhibitors enhances efficacy and durability of response.<br \/>Methods: We evaluated the antiproliferative effect of the combination of T-DXd with AZD6738 (ATR inhibitor), AZD1775 (WEE1 inhibitor), AZD1390 (ATM inhibitor), in a panel of 27 breast cancer cell lines in an <i>in vitro<\/i> 7-day viability assay. Combinations were also evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i> in the HER2-high gastric NCI-N87 cell line xenograft. To evaluate the specificity of the combination activity in tumor cells (vs normal tissue), we further evaluated the combination in a 2D <i>in vitro <\/i>human bone marrow progenitor assay.<br \/>Results: We found that the combination with all DDRi significantly enhanced<i> in vitro <\/i>cell killing activity over single agents in many of the models tested (12\/27 for AZD6738, 9\/27 for AZD1775, 6\/27 for AZD1390). This was not limited to models with DNA damage repair mutations (e.g. <i>BRCA1, BRCA2<\/i>, or <i>ATM<\/i>). Mechanistically, T-DXd activated PARP and the ATR, Wee1, ATM pathways, inducing cell cycle arrest. Combination of T-DXd with AZD6738 and AZD1775 inhibited the RS response (pATR-T1989, pChk1-S345) and cell cycle arrest (pCdc2-Y15), while AZD1390 inhibited the DSB response pathway (pATM-S1981, pRad50-S685, pKap1-S824, pChk2-T68). All DDR inhibitors exacerbated DNA damage (pRPA-S4\/8, gH2AX) and cell death (cCasp3). In the <i>in vitro <\/i>human bone marrow (BM) assay, T-DXd had no synergistic interaction with AZD6738 and AZD1775 inhibitors, but synergy with AZD1390. <i>In vivo<\/i>, combination therapy with all DDRi tested achieved superior Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI) compared to monotherapy alone. At day 41 in NCI-N87, 3mg\/kg of T-DXd provided TGI of 74% while monotherapy arms of 25mg\/kg BID AZD6738, 60mg\/kg (5-days on\/2-days off) AZD1775 or 10mg\/kg AZD1390 provided 68%, 47%, 31% TGI respectively. The combinations of T-DXd with AZD6738, AZD1775 and AZD1390 provided TGI of &#62;100% (19% regression), 90%, and 99% respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: These results suggest that AZD6738, AZD1775, and AZD1390 all potentiate T-DXd activity <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> in vivo<\/i>, and the combination interactions with AZD6738 and AZD1775 were much stronger in some tumor models over bone marrow cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. These data suggest further investigation of these combinations in clinical studies may be warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/94fe614f-74e4-46ed-b160-67b4f4fefa2f\/@q03B8ZRJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),DNA damage response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18653"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yann Wallez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theresa Proia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Azadeh Cheraghchi-Bashi-Astaneh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ankur Karmokar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zena Wilson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne Randle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Anderton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Durant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabetta Leo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Lau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark O'Connor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jerome Mettetal<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our previous studies indicate that the F-box protein SKP2 is overexpressed in OS and acts as a proto-oncogene. We recently reported that abolishing the interaction between SKP2 and its downstream substrate p27 using a Thr187Ala knock-in mutation leads to impaired tumor growth in an RB1\/TP53 deficient transgenic OS mouse model. These data suggest that inhibiting the function of SKP2 may yield therapeutic benefits in OS. However, the precise mechanisms by which SKP2 promotes tumorigenesis in OS are not fully understood.<br \/><b>Purposes:<\/b> To determine the role of SCF<sup>Skp2\/Cks1<\/sup> in OS tumorigenesis and as a potential therapeutic target.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We generated a genetically engineered mouse model of OS with a double knockout of Rb1 and p53 only within cells of the osteoblastic lineage (<i>Osx1-Cre;Rb1<sup>lox\/lox<\/sup>;Trp53<sup>lox\/lox<\/sup> <\/i>, DKO). The SKP2-knockout OS mouse model was further developed in the DKO background (<i>Osx1-Cre;Rb1<sup>lox\/lox<\/sup>;Trp53<sup>lox\/lox<\/sup>; Skp2<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>, TKO). Mice of both genotypes were monitored for tumor growth, overall survival, and <i>in vivo<\/i> drug response. Early passaged OS cells and OS organoid culture was derived from mice tumors and used for in vitro analysis. Western Blot and IHC were used for protein level determination. RT-qPCR and RNA-seq were used for transcriptional level determination. Two small-molecule SCF<sup>Skp2\/Cks1<\/sup> inhibitors (C1 and Pevonedistat) were used for <i>in vivo<\/i> and<i> in vitro<\/i> testing.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> All genotypes were born at the expected ratios and developmentally normal. DKO animals developed OS tumors with nearly full penetrance. SKP2 deletion significantly prolongs the overall survival (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001) and reduced the average tumor occurrence in OS mice (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). The <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor proliferation was also significantly delayed in the SKP2 deletion OS tumorigenesis (<i>p<\/i>=0.007). A histological analysis comparing tumors from two groups showed a decrease in proliferation (PCNA) and an increase in pro-apoptotic markers (TUNEL,etc) expression in SKP2-deleted OS. RT-qPCR and RNA-seq revealed upregulation of E2F1 downstream apoptotic-related target genes in <i>Skp2<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>OS tumors. The transcriptional level analysis also revealed inhibition of cancer stemness markers and pathways in SKP2 deleted tumors and further proved by functional analyses. Two SCF<sup>Skp2\/Cks1<\/sup> inhibitors not only showed anti-tumoral activities both in vivo (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05) and in organoid culture, but also synergistic with chemotherapy agents (ZIP synergy Score:9.34&#177;1.24).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that inhibiting SKP2 leads to significant antitumor activities in a clinically relevant OS mouse model. The strong survival benefit highlights SKP2 as a downstream actionable target in TP53\/RB1-deficient OS, for which the targeted therapies have been disappointing to date.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/15a34164-0a59-4197-aa8b-8f7a8ae47a37\/@q03B8ZRJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Transgenic mouse models,Skp2,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19024"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jichuan Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Ferrena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ranxin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swapnil Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongling Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deyou Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hasibagan Borjihan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Waleed Al-Harden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janet Tingling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David S.
