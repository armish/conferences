The KRAS G12C mutation is one of the most prevalent KRAS mutations, present in approximately 12% of non-small cell lung cancer, 4% of colorectal cancer, and up to 4% of other cancer types. The recent discovery and development of covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors provides an opportunity to inhibit what has historically been considered to be an &#8220;undruggable&#8221; target. GDC-6036 is an orally bioavailable, highly potent and selective KRAS G12C inhibitor, with a median IC50 in the sub-nanomolar range and greater than 18,000-fold selectivity for G12C versus non-G12C cell lines. GDC-6036 demonstrates greater potency and selectivity compared with other KRAS G12C inhibitors <i>in vitro<\/i>, and complete tumor growth inhibition in multiple KRAS G12C-positive cell lines and in xenograft mouse models.

It plays a critical role in several biological processes such as DNA damage repair and B cell development. Dysregulation in H3K36 methylation can occur in B cell malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), often as a result of mutational events incurred during normal B cell development. For example, 15%-20% of MM patients harbor the high risk (4;14) chromosomal translocation (t), resulting in high expression of the multiple myeloma SET domain (MMSET) gene. MMSET (also known as NSD2) is an HMT that catalyzes H3K36me1 and H3K36me2 formation, which leads to increased levels of H3K36me2 in t(4;14) MM patients. Because H3K36me2 is the substrate of SETD2, we hypothesized that inhibiting SETD2 could target the underlying oncogenic mechanism driven by the dysregulated H3K36 methylation from MMSET overexpression in t(4;14) MM patients, and would establish proof of concept in this and other B cell malignancies (e.g. DLBCL) that may demonstrate dysregulated H3K36me3 or a dependency on SETD2. In this presentation, we will describe the discovery and structure of our clinical candidate EZM0414, a first-in-class, potent, selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of SETD2; robust anti-tumor effects of SETD2 inhibition with EZM0414 in MM (including t(4;14) MM) and DLBCL preclinical studies; and the outline of the ongoing first-in-human Ph1\/1b open-label, multicenter study of EZM0414 in patients with relapsed\/refractory MM or DLBCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Epigenetics,Histone,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeffery L.

Depletion of IKZF1\/3 inhibits the growth of multiple myeloma (MM) cells, confirming their dependency on IKZF1\/3. IMiDs (lenalidomide, pomalidomide) are effective therapies for treatment of MM and promote degradation of IKZF1\/3 via their interaction with CRL4-CRBN E3 ligase. However, most patients treated with lenalidomide or pomalidomide eventually develop progressive disease due to acquired resistance, underscoring the unmet medical need. CFT7455 is a novel IKZF1\/3 degrader optimized for high binding affinity to cereblon (CRBN), rapid and deep IKZF1\/3 degradation, and potent dose-dependent efficacy in vivo.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A series of novel benzoimidazolone-based CRBN ligands with potent binding affinity were discovered and their binding modes were informed by CRBN co-crystal structures. Although the benzoimidazolone-based CRBN binders did not exhibit IKZF1\/3 degradation activity, structural insights into their unique binding modes and knowledge of the IKZF1\/3 degradation pharmacophore were combined to enable identification of a novel benzoisoindolone-based ligand that exhibited a 10-fold potency increase in biochemical CRBN binding and a 30-fold potency increase in H929 MM cell growth inhibition when compared to lenalidomide. Additional rounds of structure-based drug design, degradation and phenotypic profiling led to the discovery of CFT7455, a highly potent, selective and orally bioavailable degrader of IKZF1\/3. CFT7455 demonstrated an 800 and 1600-fold improvement in CRBN binding compared to pomalidomide in biochemical and cellular NanoBRET assays, respectively. In H929 MM cells expressing HiBiT-tagged IKZF1, CFT7455 induced &#62;75% degradation of IKZF1 within 1.5 hrs. The high binding affinity and degradation catalysis shown with CFT7455 enabled potent antiproliferative activity across a panel of MM cell lines, as well as H929 cells made resistant to IMiDs. <i>In vivo<\/i>, CFT7455 catalyzed deep and durable degradation of IKZF3, translating into potent antitumor activity in multiple myeloma xenograft models. CFT7455 also retained its activity in models resistant or insensitive to clinically approved IMiDs as single agent or in combination with standard of care agent dexamethasone.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Overall, CFT7455 is a next generation IKZF1\/3 degrader, with improved potency and anticancer efficacy in preclinical models compared to existing IMiDs. These features make CFT7455 an exciting drug candidate, as a single agent or for use in combination. CFT7455 is currently being studied in a Ph1 clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,Multiple myeloma,Transcription factor,Drug design,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James A.

Through its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity, BAF regulates the accessibility of gene-control elements, allowing for the binding of transcription factors. Thus, BAF is a major regulator of lineage- and disease-specific transcriptional programs. We have discovered and developed a compound that potently and selectively inhibits the ATPase components of the BAF complex, SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 (also called BRG1 and BRM, respectively). Mutational, structural, and biochemical studies demonstrated that this SMARCA4\/SMARCA2 inhibitor acts through a unique allosteric mechanism. Pharmacologic inhibition of the BAF complex resulted in lineage-specific changes in chromatin accessibility in cancer cell lines from diverse origins. Phenotypic screening of cancer cell lines showed that uveal melanoma and hematological cancer cell lines were exquisitely sensitive to BAF inhibition. FHD-286 is orally bioavailable and demonstrates robust efficacy in multiple cell line and primary human tumor derived xenograft models at well-tolerated doses. In preclinical efficacy and toxicology studies, this first in class molecule demonstrates an acceptable therapeutic index which should allow for flexibility in clinical designs. FHD-286 is currently in two Phase I trials for both relapsed refractory AML and MDS, and metastatic uveal melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Acute myeloid leukemia,Transcription factor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Murphy Hentemann<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
