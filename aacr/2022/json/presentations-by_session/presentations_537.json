[{"Abstract":"Despite breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, most tumor-reactive T cells cannot persist in solid tumors due to an immunosuppressive environment. We developed Tres (Tumor-resilient T cell), a computational model and web server that utilizes single-cell transcriptomic data to identify signatures of T cells that are resilient to immunosuppressive signals, such as TGF&#946;, TRAIL, and PGE2. Analyzing transcriptomic data from pretreatment or pre-manufacture patient samples, Tres reliably predicts the clinical effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade or adoptive cell transfer in melanoma, lung, and B-cell malignancies. Further, Tres identified FIBP as the top negative marker of tumor-resilient T cells across many cancers. FIBP knockouts in murine and human CD8 T cells significantly enhanced T-cell mediated cancer-killing and adoptive cell therapy by limiting cholesterol metabolism, which otherwise inhibits effector T-cell function. These results demonstrate Tres&#8217;s utility in identifying clinical biomarkers of T-cell effectiveness and potential therapeutic targets for enhancing immunotherapies in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/45abf3f2-6df1-46ee-8453-10e518a5d3e1\/@q03B8ZRT\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,CAR T cells,Bioinformatics,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17722"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peng Jiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Several factors limit the efficacy of ACT in solid tumors and lead to primary resistance and acquired resistance (refers to recurrence after the initial response). These include but not limited to the insufficient proliferation of T cells, the low capacity of T cells to penetrate stroma-rich solid tumors, and heterogeneity of antigen expression in solid tumors, which allows the escape of T cell attack by tumor cells when becoming antigen-loss-variant cancer cell (ALV). Hence, it is urgent to develop novel ACT strategies to eradicate solid tumors and prevent acquired resistance.<br \/>We have previously reported (Yong Lu, <i>Cancer Cell, <\/i>2018) that tumor-specific IL-9-producing CD4<sup>+<\/sup> Th9 cells represent a novel T cell paradigm for ACT - they are less exhausted, fully cytolytic, and hyperproliferative. This hyperproliferation of Th9 cells is driven by a unique Th9 master transcriptional factor Pu.1 mediated Pu.1-Traf6-NF&#954;B signaling to ensure Th9 cells persist as long as &#8220;stem cell-like&#8221; T cells, which is not presented in other known CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells subsets. In our most recent study, we demonstrate that murine and human Th9 cells, but not Th1\/Tc1 or Th17 cells, expressing tumor-specific T-cell-receptors (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), eradicate advanced tumors that contain ALVs. This unprecedented antitumor capacity of Th9 cells is attributed to both enhanced direct tumor cell killing and bystander antitumor effects promoted by intratumor release of IFN&#945;\/&#946;. Mechanistically, tumor-specific Th9 cells increase the intratumor accumulation of extracellular ATP (eATP, released from dying tumor cells), because of a unique feature of Th9 cells that lack the expression of ATP degrading ectoenzyme CD39. Intratumor enrichment of eATP promotes the monocyte infiltration and stimulates their production of IFN&#945;\/&#946; by inducing eATP-endogenous retrovirus-TLR3\/MAVS pathway activation. These results identify tumor-specific Th9 cells as a unique T cell subset endowed with the unprecedented capacity to eliminate ALVs for curative responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17723"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yong Lu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, its efficacy in solid tumors remains to be demonstrated. There are a number of issues currently limiting therapeutic treatment of solid tumors with CAR-T cells, none more important than target antigen selection. This is a major challenge in solid tumors due to their heterogenous characteristics and the potential for off-cancer effects. ADAM10, <u>A<\/u> <u>D<\/u>isintegrin <u>A<\/u>nd <u>M<\/u>etalloproteinase 10, plays critical roles in a wide range of pathophysiological processes during development and inflammation. These proteolytically active multifunctional proteins act as sheddases by cleaving transmembrane-bound proteins such as growth factors, adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors, which can then contribute to migration and invasion of cancer cells. An active form of ADAM10 that has undergone a conformational change has been identified in several cancer types, particularly colorectal cancer. In this study, a novel CAR was generated based on a previously characterized cancer-specific ADAM10 antibody. ADAM-10-targeting CAR-T cells were manufactured using T cells from the peripheral blood of the healthy donors. The CAR-T cells displayed the na&#239;ve and central memory phenotype that has been shown to differentiate and proliferate within tumor microenvironments, with little expression of exhaustion markers. These CAR-T cells were capable of killing several human colorectal tumor cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>, assessed in a bioluminescence-based cytotoxicity<br \/>assay. Furthermore, treatment of NSG mice bearing human LoVo colon cancer cell tumors with ADAM-10-targeting CAR-T cells led to significant inhibition of tumor growth compared with either untransduced control T cells or PBS treatment. Overall, these data suggest that targeting ADAM-10 via CAR-T cell therapy is a promising novel avenue of treatment of colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/25fa13f9-8980-4dd2-9457-ec94b15e0836\/@r03B8ZRU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,CAR T cells,In vivo,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17724"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elaheh Rohani Rad<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jade Foeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dylan McPeak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timona Tyllis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caitlin Abbott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronika Bandara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvana Napoli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Batjargal Gundsambuu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Barry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Sadlon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaun McColl<\/i><\/presenter>.

Among the killer cells, &#947;&#948;T cells possessing a wide range of antigen-independent tumor recognition and low risk of developing GVHD offer a chance to develop CAR-engineered allogenic &#8216;off-the-shelf&#8217; cellular therapeutics. Successful tumor eradication primarily depends on providing optimized signals affecting the proliferation, persistence, antitumor activity and cytokine secretion of CAR-&#947;&#948;T cells. We describe here a novel CD30 costimulatory domain for CAR signaling, which is known to be involved in cell anti-apoptosis, activation and proliferation. Conventional &#945;&#946;T cells and innate &#947;&#948;T cells activated by a CD30-&#950; signaling-CAR displayed similar levels of cytolytic efficacies and cytokine secretion against antigen-expressing cancer cell lines as those of other CAR containing commonly used costimulatory domains CD28, CD27, 4-1BB, OX40, and ICOS. Furthermore, the third-generation CARs including the CD30 costimulatory domain retained potent antitumor efficacies independent of their position or type of partner costimulatory domain. More significantly, CAR-&#947;&#948;T cells containing CD30-&#950; signaling revealed effective cytolytic activities against several solid cancer cell lines based on its antigen-recognizing antibody fragments. Our findings suggest that the CD30 costimulatory domain could be an attractive candidate for developing CAR-engineered killer cell therapeutics and may be applicable for the design of numerous antigen-recognizing CAR constructs, with an emphasis on targeting solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c47dd62-0d9f-4158-bb24-5b1cc1ce0e10\/@r03B8ZRU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Gamma-delta lymphocytes,CD30,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17725"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hyun-Il Cho<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chung-Hyo Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang-Eun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>In-Sil Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung-Min Ha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seon-Duk Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun-Jung Sohn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tai-Gyu Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Neoantigens are excellent therapeutic targets for TCR-T cell therapy, because they are highly specific and often homogeneously expressed in the tumor. While most neoantigens are patient-specific, there are rare exceptions of widely shared neoantigens, such as the driver oncogene KRAS containing mutations at position 12. The KRAS mutations G12C, G12D, and G12V are among the most common mutations in solid tumors, including indications with high unmet medical need, such as pancreatic, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer. Previous TCR-T approaches targeting KRAS G12V have been primarily focused on HLA-A*02:01, which appeared to be unable to present a mutant KRAS epitope. Here, we aim to generate TCRs of optimal affinity and high specificity to a KRAS G12V epitope in an HLA-agnostic manner using our HuTCR mouse platform.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures <\/b>HuTCR mice represent a fully humanized TCR-MHC system and bear a diverse TCR repertoire, being transgenic for the entire human TCR alpha and beta gene loci and multiple human HLA class I molecules, while lacking murine TCRs and murine MHC class I molecules.

All approved engineered cell therapies are derived from autologous T cells. This has posed barriers for patient access to qualified treatments that include a lengthy production time, inconsistent product characteristics, uncertain manufacturability, and a high cost of manufacturing. To address these obstacles, allogeneic &#8220;universal&#8221; cell therapies, derived from healthy donors or differentiated pluripotent cells are engineered and expanded in large quantities for off-the-shelf treatment. In allogeneic CAR T cell therapy, T cell receptor (TCR) knockout is required to prevent graft-versus-host disease of alloreactive T cells targeting against host tissue. Allogeneic cells may have a very limited half-life following infusion, however, as they are rapidly targeted by the patient&#8217;s own immune system causing host-versus-graft disease. Gene editing is used to increase the persistence of allogeneic T cells by enabling them to evade host T cell or natural killer (NK) cell surveillance. A conventional method of preventing host T cell rejection is to knockout (KO) the &#946;-2 microglobulin (&#946;2M) to diminish the expression of MHC class I protein. To further minimize rejection, overexpression of nonclassical MHC class I protein, HLA-E, is engineered into allogeneic T cells to evade host NK cell rejection. Strategies to improve allogenic CAR T cell persistence through immune evasion have implications for developing a therapeutic product consisting of both CAR T and CAR NK cells. Here we show the use of different methods to investigate the effectiveness of the immune evasion strategies. We found that the effectiveness of HLA-E expression in the suppression of NK cell rejection is highly correlated with the expression of CD94\/NKG2A on the host NK cells. Host NK cells with low CD94\/NKG2A expression will rapidly recognize and kill allogeneic CAR-T cells even when HLA-E is overexpressed. As it is not possible to control CD94\/NKG2A expression in patient NK cells, we sought to identify alternative factors to allow allogeneic cells to evade rapid immune recognition without requiring long term suppression of immune response. To mitigate the donor-to-donor variation on alloreactivity, we developed a strategy to identify NK ligands that can effectively diminish host NK activation in the presence of allogeneic CAR T cells with TCR and B2M gene KOs. A platform using K562 cell line was developed to screen a wide variety of NK inhibitory peptides and synthetic ligands to identify their inhibitory activities. To date, we have identified several synthetic proteins that demonstrate enhanced NK inhibitory function. These synthetic proteins can be used to complement, or to replace HLA-E and enable more extended persistence of an allogeneic cell product in a broader patient population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c1cb6742-6d4b-4659-b531-81c99ba21aaf\/@r03B8ZRU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Natural killer cells,CAR T cells,HLA class I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17730"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"3a3cb092-3935-4e51-9d0c-31b0cf3e5667","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a3cb092-3935-4e51-9d0c-31b0cf3e5667\/@r03B8ZRU\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meriam Vejiga<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Don Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangnan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Pratt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phung Gip<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Trager<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Chan<\/i><\/presenter>.

NK cells are known for their ability to kill tumor cells and do not elicit graft-versus-host disease, making them a potential source of &#8216;off-the-shelf&#8217; allogeneic cell therapy. NK cells are also amenable to CRISPR genomic engineering to enhance the antitumor activity of NK cells by increasing their cytotoxicity, overcoming suppression within the tumor microenvironment, or promoting their persistence and homing to tumor sites. Cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) is a NK cell checkpoint for IL-15 mediated NK survival, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and anti-tumor immunity. The E3 ubiquitin ligase CBLB is also a negative regulator of NK cell function and has been shown to mediate TGF-&#946; sensitivity by downregulating inhibitory SMAD7 in primary T cells. We hypothesized that knockout of both CISH and CBLB would not only improve NK cell effector function and but also render NK cells resistant to TGF-&#946; mediated suppression. In this study, we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to disrupt CISH and CBLB genes in isolated peripheral blood NK cells from healthy donors. Given that CD70 expression is present on activated NK cells, to target CD70 on renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with CAR NK cells, CD70 was knocked out in NK cells to avoid fratricide. Western blotting, FACS and TIDE\/Amplicon NGS Sequencing data confirmed all three genes were successfully disrupted. Then we expanded these edited NK cells by using IL-2 and stimulation using NKSTIM, a modified K562 stimulatory cell line expressing membrane-bound form of IL-15 (mbIL-15) and 4-1BBL. IL-12 and IL-18 were added during expansion to drive memory-like NK cell differentiation. Furthermore, we were able to transduce CRISPR\/Cas9 edited NK cells to express a CD70-CAR construct and membrane bound IL-15. CAR expression was assessed by flow cytometry. In vitro cytotoxicity was measured using the IncuCyte S3 live cell analysis system. CD70\/CISH\/CBLB triple knockout CD70-CAR NK cells could be produced efficiently and exhibited similar persistence as CD70\/CISH or CD70\/CBLB double knockout CD70-CAR NK cells in culture. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that CD70\/CISH\/CBLB triple knockout CD70-CAR NK cells had greater tumor growth control after multiple rechallenges. In the presence of exogenous TGF-&#946;, CD70\/CISH\/CBLB triple knockout CD70-CAR NK cells showed greater resistance to TGF-&#946; inhibition of cytotoxicity. In summary, we show CD70\/CISH\/CBLB triple knockout CD70-CAR NK cells demonstrate enhanced anti-tumor activity against relevant solid tumor cell lines and provide greater resistance to tumor microenvironment inhibition. These data support the further exploration of CD70\/CISH\/CBLB triple gene knockout CD70 CAR NK cells for clinical application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6f9dc473-73b7-4560-90ba-c24b04008a46\/@r03B8ZRU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,CRISPR\/Cas9,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17731"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chao Guo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanying Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Aronov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sombeet Sahu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary-Lee Dequéant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Changan Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sushant Karnik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Glenn D.

In combination with a CAR, bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) can target additional tumor antigens (2&#176; Ag) while engaging CD3 signaling molecules on T cells, providing a unique way to address tumor heterogeneity, mitigate antigen escape and further potentiate durable effector function. However, in generating off-the-shelf universal CAR-T and NK cells, a combination strategy is not feasible as neither modified cell product is compatible to specifically engage with a BiTE. In developing allogeneic CAR-T cells, the T cell receptor (TCR) surface expression must be eliminated to prevent graft versus host disease, but the absence of surface TCR expression leads to loss of surface CD3 expression and BiTE compatibility. Similarly, NK cells naturally lack TCR expression and have no surface CD3 molecules for BiTE engagement.<br \/>Here we discuss the development of a novel chimeric CD3&#949; fusion receptor (CD3-CFR) with a modified transmembrane and endodomain enabling surface expression in TCR-less T or NK cells, allowing for a novel combinatorial solution between universal CAR-T or NK cells with BiTEs in an allogeneic setting.<br \/>CD3-CFR signal transduction was initially investigated in TRAC knockout NFAT reporter (T-KO) Jurkat cells engineered with CD3-CFR and co-cultured with EpCAM<sup>+<\/sup> target cells. When soluble EpCAM-BiTE was added to the co-culture, the observed 6.9-fold increase in NFAT activity indicated successful engagement associated with the interaction of CD3-CFR, target cells and the BiTE. CD3-CFR T-KO Jurkat cells were further modified to secrete the EpCAM-BiTE and showed increased NFAT activity, demonstrating the feasibility of self-secreting BiTE-mediated targeting through CD3-CFR signaling.<br \/>We next engineered CD3-CFR expressing iPSC-derived CAR-T (iT) cells to show preserved T cell differentiation kinetics and maintained CAR activity against 1&#176; Ag positive targets (&#62;90% cytolysis). Importantly, while CAR-iT cells showed only background lysis of 1&#176; Ag negative tumor cells, CD3-CFR<sup>+<\/sup> CAR-iT cells were able to lyse ~99% of 1&#176; Ag negative tumor cells with the addition of soluble EpCAM-BiTE targeting the 2&#176; Ag. When CD3-CFR<sup>+<\/sup> CAR-iT cells were further engineered to secrete the EpCAM-BiTE, CD3-CFR<sup>+<\/sup> BiTE<sup>+<\/sup> CAR-iT cells demonstrated superior killing of heterogenous tumors compared to CD3-CFR<sup>+<\/sup> BiTE<sup>-<\/sup> CAR-iT cells (70% vs. 5% cytolysis). Taken together these data demonstrate for the first time that CD3 expression and BiTE engagement can be combined in a universal iPSC-derived CAR-iT cell product to overcome antigen heterogeneity and enhance efficacy in solid tumor settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ee5d4d92-60fa-4272-85d0-2255944838ae\/@r03B8ZRU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,BiTE antibody,Adoptive cell therapy,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17732"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eigen Peralta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Landon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui-Yi Chu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amit Mehta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Chu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alec Witty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bahram Valamehr<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite elevated lymphocyte populations in tumor microenvironment, these lymphocytes have modest killing activity. One of the possible speculations is constitutive STAT3 overexpression within NPC microenvironment which results in immunosuppression of cytolytic immune cells. Natural killer (NK) cells act as first line defense of innate immunity through cytolytic killing of virus-infected cells and\/ or cancer cells. Unlike T cells, NK killing does not require antigen presentation and therefore would be effective even for MHC defective cancers. This makes NK therapy attractive in form of autologous and allogeneic transfer.<br \/>Here we hypothesized that activated NK cells would show enhanced anti-NPC activity. We also sought to investigate the potential of combined NK with STAT3 inhibitor in NPC treatment. In this study, NK cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy donors (N=3) were isolated and expanded. Three Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) positive NPC cell lines (NPC43, C666-1, C17) were employed in this study. Na&#239;ve and activated NK cells were subjected to NPC coculture at various effector: target (E:T) cell ratios. In combination treatment with NK cells, a small molecule inhibitor Napabucasin was employed for STAT3 treatment. NK killing activity was assessed through flow cytometry analysis of NPC cell death.<br \/>The current study demonstrated significant elevation of NK activation marker expressions after 4 weeks of <i>ex vivo <\/i>expansion (CD69 34.7&#177;2.3 fold, p=0.002; NKG2D 4.2&#177;0.8 fold, p=0.018). Concomitantly, <i>ex vivo <\/i>activated NK cells demonstrated augmented killing activity against NPC cells at a dose-dependent manner, compared to their na&#239;ve status (p&#60;0.001). In NPC43, net cytotoxicity of expanded NK was 35.5&#177;7.2% compared to na&#239;ve NK with only 2.5&#177;4.3% (p=0.003). NPC43 was most sensitive towards NK killing, followed by C666-1, then C17. This corresponds to NPC43&#8217;s low PD-L1 protein expression, a known downstream STAT3 target and immune checkpoint molecule. In addition, activated NK could kill chemoresistant NPC cells indiscriminately compared to the paralleled parental cells (18.5&#177;2.3% and 16.1&#177;3.8%, p=0.589). Importantly, augmented NPC43 cell death was observed in combined treatment (47.1&#177;2.1%) compared to single treatment (NK alone: 9.2&#177;6.5%; Napabucasin alone: 25.0&#177;4.5%). In summary, this work demonstrated encouraging therapeutic potential of both NK therapy and in combination with STAT3 inhibitor Napabucasin for NPC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/936ba930-8f04-480c-b07e-74e96c896c78\/@r03B8ZRU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,STAT3,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17733"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shinyee Hui<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kwok Wai Lo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingjing Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siu Tim Cheung<\/i><\/presenter>.

The combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 demonstrated better anti-tumor response, but toxicity is a concern. Cytokines including IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21 that target immune cells have been developed to enhance immune response against tumors. Clinical trials for the combination of cytokines and anti-PD-1 have been proposed (Mohamad et al, 2020). IL-12, a multifunctional cytokine, regulates both innate and adaptive immunity. The role of IL-12 in regulating immune response showed that intra-tumoral electroporation of plasmid IL-12 prime responses to anti-PD-1 treatment (Algazi et al, 2016). IL-12 produced by dendritic cells accompanied with IFN-&#947; play an important role in anti-tumor response induced by anti-PD-1 (Garris et al, 2018). Therefore, this study aims to explore the synergistic anti-tumor immune response of recombinant murine IL-12 (rmIL-12) and anti-PD-1.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Different doses of rmIL-12 alone or combined with anti-PD-1 were administered in different tumor models. CT26, MC38, Hepa 1-6 that generate hot tumor were used. Tumors were inoculated subcutaneously in syngeneic mouse tumor models and treated when mean tumor volume reach 60-100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>. Tumor resection and splenectomy were performed on tumor inoculated mice at termination. Immunocytochemistry stain was used to detect immune cells including CD4, CD8 T cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and macrophage. Serum cytokines were checked for immune response and liver enzyme for toxicity.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The combination of rmIL-12 and anti-PD-1 (BIW x 3 weeks) showed better tumor control compared to anti-PD-1 alone with CT26, MC38, Hepa 1-6 cell lines. Synergistic effect was observed even with a low dose of rmIL-12 (20 ng\/mice). A higher dose of rmIL-12 achieved better tumor control. In the CT26 tumor model, combination therapy suppressed tumor growth up to 73% compared to anti-PD-1 alone. These results demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship. The combination of rmIL-12 and anti-PD-1 induced higher level of IFN-&#947; compared to anti-PD-1 or rmIL-12 alone. A higher dose of rmIL-12 resulted in higher IFN-&#947; level. The IFN-&#947; level peaked about 12 hours after the treatment and returned near baseline in about 48 hours. The combination of rmIL-12 and anti-PD-1 showed higher percentage of CD8 T cells in tumors compared to anti-PD-1 or rmIL-12 alone. Combination group significantly decreased Treg in the tumor microenvironment, but not MDSC. Combination therapy also reprogrammed the macrophages from M2 towards M1 polarization in the tumor. Finally, no significant elevation of AST\/ALT level was observed among all the groups.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The combination of rmIL-12 and anti-PD-1 demonstrated a synergistic immune response for tumor control.

Part of the problem is that cancers employ multiple checkpoints; thus, targeting multiple checkpoint receptors simultaneously may yield increased benefit. Previously, we found that radiotherapy (XRT) in concert with a radiation-enhancing nanoparticle (NBTXR3) and PD1 blockade significantly improved tumor control both at the irradiative site and in remote, unirradiated tumors in a mouse model of anti-PD1 (&#945;PD1)-resistant lung cancer (344SQR). Here, we tested whether blockade of TIGIT, LAG3, and PD1 in combination with NBTXR3-enhanced XRT could improve antitumor immune responses in our 344SQR tumor model.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Fifty thousand 344SQR cells were inoculated in the right and left hindlimbs of 129Sv\/Ev mice on day 0 and day 4 to establish primary and secondary tumors, respectively. Mice were divided into six treatment groups: 1) untreated; 2) XRT+&#945;PD1; 3) NBTXR3+XRT+&#945;PD1; 4) NBTXR3+XRT+&#945;PD1+&#945;LAG3; 5) NBTXR3+XRT+&#945;PD1+&#945;TIGIT; and 6) NBTXR3+XRT+&#945;PD1+&#945;LAG3 +&#945;TIGIT. Primary tumors were intratumorally injected with NBTXR3 nanoparticles on day 7 and received 3 fractions of 12 Gy X-ray radiation on days 8, 9, and 10. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, composed of &#945;PD1 (200 &#956;g), &#945;LAG3 (200 &#956;g), and &#945;TIGIT (200 &#956;g), were intraperitoneally administered to the mice on days 5, 8, 11, 14. The expression of 770 immune-related genes were measured <i>via <\/i>NanoString from the RNA extracted from the primary and secondary tumors on day 21.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> CPIs+NBTXR3-enhanced radiation significantly promoted the upregulation of mRNA transcripts involved in innate immunity, the humoral response, B cell function, dendritic cell (DC) function, and antigen processing within primary, irradiated tumors relative to untreated controls. No additional increase in immune gene activity in the irradiated tumors was observed when LAG3, TIGIT, or both were blocked in addition to PD1. However, within the non-irradiated tumors, triple blockade of PD1, LAG3, and TIGIT in concert with NBTXR3+XRT produced elevations in multiple immune-related pathways that were significantly higher than those produced by other treatment combinations. These pathways included both adaptive and innate immunity; B, T, and natural killer (NK) cell, and DC function; and antigen processing.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Simultaneous inhibition of LAG3 and TIGIT in tandem with PD1 blockade and NBTXR3-enhanced radiotherapy promotes immune activation at the irradiated site. In addition, abscopal immune responses are improved with blockade of LAG3 and TIGIT. These results suggest that blockade of multiple immune checkpoints in parallel with NBTXR3-mediated radiotherapy may be effective in metastatic cancers.<br \/>[Y.H. and B.G. contributed equally to this work.]","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/88290bb2-0266-4568-aa4b-39765486c42a\/@s03B8ZRV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioimmunotherapy,Radiation-enhancing nanoparticle,Immune checkpoint inhibitors,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17735"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yun Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Genevieve Bertolet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastien Paris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hampartsoum Barsoumian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan DA SILVA<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saumil Gandhi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quynh-Nhu Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria A.

For patients with metastatic GBC, chemotherapy remains the standard of care with limited efficacy. The combination of HER2 antibody trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the frontline treatment option for patients with HER2-positive breast\/gastric cancer. Recently, this regime also showed antitumor activity in HER2-positive GBC. However, resistance to this regime represents a clinical challenge. Camrelizumab is a novel PD-1 antibody approved for Hodgkin lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma in China. Here we presented a HER2-positive metastatic GBC patient who was refractory to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy but experienced significant clinical benefit after the addition of camrelizumab. A 69-year-old male GBC patient was found disease progression in the lung six month after operation, staged IV (T3N0M1). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for HER2 (3+) and negative for PD-L1 in both primary and pulmonary lesions. Chemotherapy including S-1 plus gemcitabine, as well as oxaliplatin plus paclitaxel consecutive failed, with a new lesion discovered in the liver. Genomic profiling with a multi-gene NGS panel testing (Onco Panscan<sup>TM<\/sup>, Genetron Health) of the pulmonary lesion showed the presence of <i>TP53<\/i> S241Y, <i>ARID2<\/i> R273*, <i>EGFR<\/i> E872K mutations, <i>HER2<\/i> amplification (fold change, 8.7), and high tumor mutational burden (TMB 10.33). He was treated with trastuzumab in combination with afatinib and capecitabine. Unfortunately, progressive disease in the lung and brain was observed after two cycles. Due to progression of disease and high TMB of the pulmonary biopsy, also based on the reported activity of PD-1 antibody plus trastuzumab in trastuzumab-resistant, advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, a triplet regime of camrelizumab, trastuzumab, and oxaliplatin was administered. The lesions of the lung, liver, and brain completely regressed after five cycles. From cycle 8 of maintance regime, an anti-angiogenic agent apatinib was added to treat reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (RCCEP), the most common immune-related adverse event (irAE) related to camrelizumab, with complete regression after four months. Currently, the patient remains in remission. Our case highlights the potential of immunotherapy in combination with HER2-targeted therapy in HER2-positive GBC. We also demonstrated that immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with camrelizumab can be managed with an anti-VEGF agent apatinib. This case not only highlights the importance of irAE management in patients treated with camrelizumab, but also demonstrates the potential of PD-1 antibody plus trastuzumab in HER2-positive GBCs who have developed resistance to chemotherapy and trastuzumab-based targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4e79b8ec-e6f8-415c-8633-00c459a45609\/@s03B8ZRV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,combination immunotherapy,trastuzumab resistance,irAE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17736"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dong Yan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaomo Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yurong Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Si Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, agonist antibodies targeting CD137 have not been clinically successful due to severe systemic toxicity. Therefore, we generated STA551, a tumor selective CD137 agonist antibody. STA551 binds to CD137 only in the presence of ATP, which is known to be present at high levels in tumor tissue, and activates immune cells such as T cells. Previous studies have shown that STA551 exhibits antitumor efficacy without inducing a systemic immune response in a murine model. Combination studies with anti-PD-L1 antibody have also shown synergistic efficacy without inducing a systemic immune response. However, it was unclear why they exhibit strong combination effects. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism of STA551 and anti-PD-L1 antibody efficacy through comprehensive analysis of gene expression using single cell RNA sequencing.<br \/><b>Method &#38; Result:<\/b> In a colon 38-bearing human CD137 knock-in mouse model, combination therapy with STA551 and anti-PD-L1 antibody showed potent anti-tumor efficacy.

To perform a detailed mechanistic analysis, tumor tissue was collected after antibody administration and CD3 positive and CD3 negative fractions were separated and gene expression was comprehensively analyzed using single cell RNA-seq. Next, the fraction expressing Cd8a gene was extracted from CD3 positive fraction and clustered. One cluster was found to be markedly increased in STA551 and anti-PD-L1 antibody combination compared to vehicle or monotherapy treatment. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that the cluster was enriched for genes related to cytokines and chemokines.

In approximately half of all CRC cases, oncogenic KRAS mutations underlie poor prognosis and drug resistance. A previous multi-genomic analysis of 4,725 biological processes with 106 human non-small-cell lung cancer cells identified nuclear transport machinery as the sole process selectively required for the survival of KRAS mutant cells. Selinexor is a clinically approved oral inhibitor of nuclear export protein Exportin 1 (XPO1\/CRM1). In preclinical studies, selinexor demonstrated robust synthetical lethality with native or engineered oncogenic KRAS both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Clinical activity of selinexor monotherapy was observed in CRC patients with various KRAS oncogenic mutations (Razak 2016 JCO). We performed preclinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of selinexor and the anti-PD-1 antibody RMP1-14 in syngeneic mouse models of KRAS mutant CRC.<br \/>Methods: Two syngeneic CT-26 KRAS mutant CRC mouse models were tested: 1) metastasis model with intra-hepatically injected CT-26 cells expressing luciferase (8 mice per group); and 2) subcutaneous model with CT-26 injected into the left flank (10 mice per group). Mice were allocated to four groups: vehicle control, selinexor (15 mg\/kg, PO, once weekly), RMP1-14 (300 &#181;g\/mouse, IP, once weekly), or the combination of selinexor and RMP1-14. Tumor progression and body weight of test mice were monitored throughout the experiment. Tumor samples and plasma were collected at the end of the study for further analysis.<br \/>Results: Both selinexor and RMP1-14 demonstrated single agent activity against KRAS mutant CRC in the two mouse models relative to controls. In the metastasis model, tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at Day 21 was 63.5% (p=0.0001) for selinexor and 68.9% (p&#60;0.0001) for RMP1-14. The combination of selinexor and RMP1-14 significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis with a TGI of 98.9% (p&#60;0.0001). No tumors were detected in two mice from the combination group at the end of the study. A similar trend was observed in the subcutaneous xenograft models, at Day 17, TGIs for selinexor, RMP1-14 and combination treatment were 17.6% (p=0.0921), 26.9% (p=0.0059) and 70.4% (p&#60;0.0001), respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Synergistic anti-cancer activity of selinexor and anti-PD-1 antibody in KRAS mutant CRC mouse models warrants further clinical investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8dddec1f-5d0f-4b12-97ca-9cc7edcc69b9\/@s03B8ZRV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,KRAS,Colorectal cancer,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17738"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"88e776b2-d7df-4c4b-8499-438e680ad919","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/88e776b2-d7df-4c4b-8499-438e680ad919\/@s03B8ZRV\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hua Chang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leah Henegar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher J.

Signaling through PD-1\/PD-L1 exerts major effects on cytokines production by T cells, inhibiting production of IFN-&#947; and IL-2. LAG-3 is a cell surface molecule expressed on effector T cells and Tregs, which plays a vital role in regulating T cell function to promote tumoral immune escape. LAG-3 and PD-1 mediate different signaling pathways, but they may act synergistically to cause effector T cell inactivation and exhaustion. AK129 is being investigated as a cancer immunotherapeutic agent.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The antigen binding activity of AK129 to PD-1 and LAG-3 were measured by ELISA and FACS. In reporter gene assay, the bioactivities of AK129 to block the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1 and to neutralize LAG-3-mediated activity were determined. The bioactivity of AK129 to enhance IL-2 and IFN-&#947; production in PBMCs via blockade of PD-1 and PD-L1\/2 interaction were determined by using cellular assays. In <i>in-vivo<\/i> pharmacology studies, anti-tumor activity of AK129 was investigated in BALB\/c-hPD1\/hLAG3 mice bearing CT26.WT tumor model.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>AK129 showed good antigen binding to PD-1 and LAG-3. AK129 potently inhibited the binding of LAG-3 to its ligand MHC-II, and the binding of PD-1 to its ligand PD-L1, thus blocking downstream immune suppression. At the individual target level, AK129 demonstrated a similar PD-1 blocking activity compared to penpulimab, and similar LAG-3 blocking activity compared to relatlimab. Importantly, at the whole cell level, the enhancement effect of AK129 is stronger than the combination of penpulimab and relatlimab, as evidenced by significantly higher level of IL-2 and IFN-&#947; secretion from PBMCs. AK129 showed favorable anti-tumor activity in BALB\/c-hPD1\/hLAG3 mice bearing CT26.WT tumor model, with tumor growth inhibition values reaching 99.27% and 89.48% in high dose (20 mg\/kg) and low dose (4 mg\/kg) group of AK129, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>AK129 is a dual checkpoint blocking bispecific antibody with design features similar to the PD-1\/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody AK104, which demonstrated efficacy similar to PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibody combo and much improved safety profile. AK129 has demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity in both <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> pre-clinical studies, and with enhanced T cell activity compared to PD-1 and LAG-3 antibody combo.

TNFR2 is a receptor for TNF-&#945;, expressed highly selective in immune cells, and some tumor cells, transducing survival and immunostimulatory signal to cells expressing this receptor. Targeting TNFR2 may modulate this signaling, therefore a humanized anti-TNFR2 antibody, LBL-019, was developed for monotherapy or in combination with other anti-tumor therapies.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> LBL-019 is a monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype. The binding affinity to TNFR2 was determined by Fortebio. The epitope of TNFR2 was identified by differential binding to a serial human\/mouse chimeric TNFR2 proteins. The binding of TNF-&#945; to either TNFR2 protein or TNFR2 expressed in cells was examined by using ELISA and flow cytometry. The in vitro activity of LBL-019 was measured using several in vitro assays, e.g., cell proliferation and cytokine release in T cells, ADCC and CDC assays. The anti-tumor activity of LBL-019 was investigated in a model of human TNFR2 transgenic mice (Shanghai Model Organisms) implanted with MC38-OVA cells.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> The binding affinity of LBL-019 was measured as 5.32 nM to human and 3.62 nM to cynomolgus TNFR2. It was found that TNFR2 was expressed in immune cells including T cells and monocytes examined in human PBMC, which was upregulated when T cells were activated. TNFR2 was also found highly expressed in some tumor cell lines and tumor TILs (from in vivo studies described below). The epitope of TNFR2 that LBL-019 binds was identified and mapped out CRD1 domain. The binding of TNF-&#945; with either TNFR2 protein or TNFR2 expressed in immune cells was blocked by LBL-019. The growth of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells was significantly enhanced, when incubated with LBL-019, along with elevated IFN-&#947; release. In a model of human TNFR2 transgenic mice implanted with MC38-OVA cells, LBL-019 was shown significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in a dose dependent manner as compared with vehicle treated mice (p&#60;0.01). It appeared that the antibody with wild type Fc showed a better anti-tumor activity than that with silenced Fc, suggesting that Fc mediated NK killing of tumor cells or Treg may have contributed in part to the observed anti-tumor efficacy in this model. In addition, LBL-019 was also exhibited a synergy of anti-tumor activity, when dosed with anti-PD-1 (TGI reaching 79.51%).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> LBL-019, a humanized anti-TNFR2 antibody, shows great anti-tumor efficacy in a mouse tumor model, likely due to the mechanisms involving enhanced proliferation of Teff, elevated IFN-&#947; release, and possibly killing of tumor cells and Treg.

As a new multifunctional immune checkpoint molecule, TIGIT holds promise to become an important cancer immune therapy target. AK127 is a novel humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT). AK127 binds to TIGIT specifically and blocks the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands, thus relieves immune suppression and promotes anti-tumor immune response.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>The effect of AK127 on secretion of IL-2 in mixed culture of Jurkat-TIGIT and HT1080-aCD3scFv cells (ELISA) was determined in cellular assays.

In preclinical <i>in-vivo<\/i> pharmacology studies, synergistic anti-tumor activity of AK127 and a bi-specific anti-PD1\/CTLA4 antibody Cadonilimab (AK104) was investigated in BALB\/c-hPD-1\/hTIGIT transgenic mice with CT26.WT tumor model.<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> AK127 blocked the immune inhibitory signal mediated by TIGIT, resulting in enhanced IL-2 secretion.

Inhibition of any of these targets have shown enhanced preclinical efficacy in combination with PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors. CD39 is an ectonucleotidase which degrades extracellular ATP to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This is considered a rate-limiting step for the further degradation to adenosine by CD73. Adenosine is an immunosuppressive metabolite that can suppress NK and T cells. Blockade of CD39-mediated degradation of ATP to AMP may therefore recover anti-tumor immunity through preventing the enrichment of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> Two anti-CD39 VHH molecules were generated, named Ye-37 and Ye-46, which bind to two different epitopes on CD39. Binding experiments were carried out by bio-layer interferometry. Cell binding experiments were tested on CD39-overexpression cell lines by flow cytometry. Cellular CD39 enzymatic inhibition experiments were tested using an MOLP-8 cell line and PBMC via a luminescence-based assay. Soluble CD39 enzymatic tests were carried out on recombinant CD39 protein using a similar method. T cell proliferation assays were performed and observed on CD4+ or CD8+ T cell populations. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies were tested in B-NDG B2M-KO mice that were injected subcutaneously with A375-CD39+ tumor cells and human PBMC. An anti-PD1 x CD39 bispecific antibody was then generated by fusing the anti-CD39 biparatopic antibody to the C-terminus of an anti-PD1 IgG and tested using similar methods.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Two candidates, Ye-37 and Ye-46, were selected for their functional activity that recognize non-overlapping epitopes on CD39. The combination of Ye-37 and Ye-46 shows high potency in cell-based and soluble CD39 assays in blocking CD39 activity. Two biparatopic molecules were generated by fusing the biparatopic unit to the N- or C-termini of Fc (46-37-Fc and Fc-37-46) and showed similar activity to the combination. <i>In vivo<\/i>, we showed single-agent control of tumor growth and potentiation of tumor-growth inhibition when combined with anti-CD73 antibodies. An anti-PD1 x CD39 bispecific was generated and showed potent inhibition of PD-1\/PD-L1 interactions by cell-based assays. Potent anti-tumor efficacy was shown, which was as effective as the combination of anti-PD1 plus anti-CD39 antibodies.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Potent anti-CD39 and anti-PD1 x CD39 therapeutic candidates have been generated with promising activity as a combinatory or single agent, respectively. As such, we plan to file for clinical trial authorization of these programs by 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fe4d03fe-6305-49fb-b0f2-253229fd4866\/@t03B8ZRW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,PD-1,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Bispecific antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17747"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zhenqing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunli Jia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoniu Miao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weifeng Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhijun Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenchao Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liandi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyuan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Andy Tsun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

ASC61 is converted to its pharmacologically active metabolite ASC61-A in the plasma. In vitro studies showed that ASC61-A could activate PD-L1 dimerization and membrane PD-L1 protein internalization, interfere PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction and enhance T-cell activation. Here we report the in vivo efficacy of ASC61 in two tumor mouse models. ASC61 was found to have the best antitumor activity among all test drugs in the syngeneic tumor mouse model, BALB\/c mice bearing CT-26-hPD-L1 tumors. Then a humanized mouse model, PD-1\/PD-L1 dKI HuGEMM bearing hPD-L1 MC38 tumor, was used to further validate the therapeutic efficacy of ASC61.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: In the BALB\/c mouse model, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with CT-26-hPD-L1 cells. When the average tumor volume reached approximately 69 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were randomly assigned and treated twice a day (BID) with vehicle, reference drug (Atezolizumab), ASC61, GLC01-589 or GLC01-633 for 19 days. In the PD-1\/PD-L1 dKI HuGEMM mouse model, MC38 hPD-L1 cells were subcutaneously inoculated in the right rear flank region of mice. Once the mean tumor size reached approximately 78.3 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were randomized and treated BID for 16 days with vehicle, Atezolizumab, ASC61 (50 or 100 mg\/kg). In both models, body weights and tumor volumes were measured regularly, and tumor growth inhibitions (TGI) of different groups were compared.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>:<b> <\/b>All mice showed a gradually increase in body weight during the study and no significant difference of body weight or body weight change was found among different groups in both mouse models. In the BALB\/c mouse model, ASC61 50 mg\/kg showed significantly inhibitory effects on the tumor growth with the best TGI value of 52.9% (p &#60; 0.05) on Day 19, even better than that of the reference drug (40.77%). In the PD-1\/PD-L1 dKI HuGEMM mouse model, Group 2 to 4 showed TGI values of 69.62%, 33.62% and 63.15% on Day 16, respectively. Atezolizumab 5 mg\/kg BIW and ASC61 100 mg\/kg BID produced similar significant antitumor efficacies (both p &#60; 0.001). Survival analysis showed significant differences between Group 1 and Group 2 to 4 (p = 0.0002, 0.0338 and 0.0027, respectively).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Results of this study show that ASC61 is well tolerated in both mouse models, and ASC61 has comparable antitumor efficacies as the FDA-approved PD-L1 antibody, Atezolizumab. ASC61 is an oral PD-L1 inhibitor, and thus will have better patient compliance than injective PD-1\/PD-L1 antibody. ASC61 first in human clinical trial will begin soon.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/83800783-5f04-4663-9fce-896dde6e703a\/@t03B8ZRW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,PD-L1,ASC61,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17748"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jinzi J.

Anti-PD-1 antibody has presented durable clinical response in mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)\/microsatellite instable (MSI-H) mCRC as first-line treatment while its efficacy in microsatellite stable (MSS) mCRC is still controversial. Combination of anti-PD-1 and targeted therapy or chemotherapies was regarded as potential regimens in MSS mCRC. Moreover, it is fully elucidated that immune checkpoint inhibitor used in initial therapy would have higher probability to achieve treatment response. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of anti-PD-1 plus targeted drugs and cytotoxic drugs as conversion\/first-line therapy in fifteen untreated mCRC.<br \/>Methods: Thirteen MSS and two MSI-H mCRC were included. All patients received at least one cycle of anti-PD-1 (Pembrolizumab, Sintilimab or Toripalimab, q3w) combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab plus chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFOXIRI regimens).<br \/>Results: 8 patients were RAS-mutant and 1 patient harbored BRAF-V600E. 13 patients had liver metastasis, 3 had lung metastasis and 3 had retroperitoneal lymph metastasis. 4 patients, including 2 MSI-H patients and 2 MSS patients had complete response (CR), 8 patients had partial response (PR), 2 patients had stable disease (SD) and 1 patient had progression disease (PD). The conversion rate was 80% (12\/15), including 10 patients received resection or thermal ablation of metastatic tumor and 2 patients achieved CR. 9 patients were R0 resection and 10 patients achieved NED (no evidence of disease) status. G3-4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 1 patient (neutropenia, n=1). No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse events.<br \/>Conclusions: The triplet regimen of anti-PD-1, bevacizumab or cetuximab and chemotherapy was safe and tolerant and showed encouraging anti-tumor activities in MSS mCRC.

Co-administration of those 2 agents can potentially face challenges related to overlapping toxicities in obtaining optimal doses for synergistic effects. We propose to potentiate the synergy by enabling cis activation of IL-2 agonism and blockade of PD-1\/PDL-2 binding with a single anti-PD1-IL2 to generate Bifunctional SuperKines for ImmunoTherapy (BiSKIT). Both human (h) and mouse (m) versions of anti-PD1 are fused with MDNA109FEAA, an IL-2 superkine with enhanced affinity for IL-2R&#946; (CD122) and no binding to IL-2R&#945; (CD25).<br \/>Experimental Procedure: Studies included binding analyses with Biacore\/SPR, signaling analyses in an IL-2 cell reporter assay, cell proliferation assay, in vitro pSTAT5 signaling in human PBMCs, PD1\/PDL-1 cell reporter assay and efficacy in syngeneic tumor models.<br \/>Summary of Data: Anti-hPD1-MDNA109FEAA and surrogate anti-mPD1-MDNA109FEAA were tested in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Both constructs demonstrated selective binding to either hPD1 or mPD1 as expected, and the MDNA109FEAA motif retained its receptor selectivity (enhanced affinity to CD122 and no binding to CD25). In both HEK-Blue IL-2 reporter and CTLL-2 proliferation bioassays, anti-PD1-MDNA109FEAA exhibited similar agonistic effect as MDNA109FEAA-Fc, demonstrating that potency towards the IL-2 axis was not diminished. This was further confirmed with pSTAT5 signaling in primary human PBMCs where anti-PD1-MDNA109FEAA showed enhanced activation of CD8 T-cells and NK cells with reduced activity on Treg when compared to rhIL-2. Both constructs were also effective at inhibiting PD1\/PDL-1 pathway in respective human and mouse specific cell-based reporter assays. In a CT26 syngeneic colon tumor model, anti-mPD1-MDNA109FEAA exhibited superior efficacy over monotherapy and combination with anti-mPD1 and MDNA109FEAA-Fc when administered at equal molar dosage and same schedule.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>We have engineered anti-PD1-MDNA109FEAA to enable cis engagement with IL-2 receptor and PD1 as an approach to activate immune cells while reducing their exhaustion. Anti-mPD1-MDNA109FEAA achieved potent efficacy in a CT26 colon tumor model and is currently being evaluated in additional syngeneic tumor models with varying responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c553673f-22c3-4526-90a7-2eba3d721351\/@t03B8ZRW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Cytokines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17751"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Minh D.

Results from seven Phase I\/II to II clinical studies suggest that YIV-906 has potential to prolong survival and improve quality of life for patients who have liver, pancreatic, colorectal, and rectal cancer and received chemotherapy and\/or radiation therapy. Currently, a phase II international clinical trial for using YIV-906 plus sorafenib to target HBV positive hepatocellular carcinoma as first line therapy (NCT04000737) had been initialized. Recently, we demonstrated that YIV-906 could enhance anti-tumor activity of anti-PD1 against hepatoma in mice by enhancing both adaptive immunity and innate immunity thought promoting T cell activation by modulating IDO activity and potentiating IFNg action to polarize macrophages into M1-like type. Here, by using Jurkat cells-staphylococcal superantigen E (SEE)-Raji cells cell culture model, we demonstrated that YIV-906 could promote T cell activation with up-regulation of CD69 by modulating nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) activity. This could be due to that YIV-906 could trigger protein phosphorylation of T cell receptor signaling cascades including, Lck, Fyn, Zap70, LAT and Pyk2. Importantly, YIV-906 could enhance Anti-PD1 action to recuse the depressed NFAT activity of Jurkat cells-PD1 cells when incubated with Raji-PD-L1 cells. In addition, YIV-906 could also enhance NFAT activity triggered by the interaction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-CD19-CD3z) on Jurkat cells and CD19 on Raji cells. Component S (<i>Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi<\/i>) of YIV-906 was found to play key roles of the above activities. Flavonoids of S, such as baicalein, chrysin and oroxylin A, were identified to have modulation effect on NFAT activity. In conclusion, YIV-906 could modulate both adaptive immunity and innate immunity to facilitate immune checkpoint blockade therapy or CAR T-cell therapy for treatment of cancer in patients. This is worthy of further investigation.

It is a key regulator of immune activation, that modifies function through multiple mechanisms. Increased PVR expression levels have been associated with resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, while loss of PVR led to reduced tumor growth. Targeting PVR using mAbs offers an intriguing therapeutic approach for patients with advanced cancers, who are not responding to other ICIs.NTX-1088 is a potent, first-in-class, anti-PVR mAb, developed for the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid tumors. The antibody binds PVR with high affinity, blocks its interactions with TIGIT and CD96, and preventing their inhibitory signaling. Moreover, NTX-1088 block the critical interaction between PVR and DNAM1 (CD226). This blockade prevents internalization of DNAM1, restores its expression on the surface of immune cells and results in a robust antitumor activity.NTX-1088 was thoroughly investigated in vitro and in vivo. Various cancer cell lines were co-cultured with immune effector cells from healthy human donors, in the presence of NTX-1088, alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb (pembrolizumab). NTX-1088 significantly increased immune cell activation, as measured by IFN-gamma release from activated polyclonal CD8+ T cells, induction of CD137 and killing of tumor cells. When tested in combination with pembrolizumab, NTX-1088 further improved all measured activation parameters. Synergistic effect was obtained when NTX-1088 was combined with the anti-CD112R mAb, NTX-2R13. The effect surpassed that of TIGIT and CD112R combined inhibition. When compared to anti-TIGIT mAb (tiragolumab), NTX-1088 demonstrated clear superiority in activating<sup> <\/sup>T and NK cells as a single agent. Furthermore, NTX-1088 in combination with pembrolizumab, was superior to the combination of pembrolizumab with tiragolumab. Importantly, NTX-1088 was the only intervention that significantly restored DNAM1 levels, leading to an enhanced antitumor immune surveillance. Numerous humanized murine models, including pembrolizumab-insensitive models, confirmed the above observations; NTX-1088 exhibited a robust tumor growth inhibition, accompanied by significantly higher prevalence of CD137+, DNAM1+, CD8+ T cells within the tumor bed, compared to mice treated by other ICIs. This is the first report of drug-induced DNAM1 restoration and immune activation. NTX-1088 shows, for the first time, exclusive triple mechanism of action, whereby simultaneous and effective blockade of TIGIT and CD96 is complemented by the efficient restoration of DNAM1. This is a step change in antitumor immune activation that provides a remarkable and differentiated addition to the armamentarium available to patients and their treating oncologists. An IND will be open during 2Q2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/48ec3865-82a7-4d76-a5b9-cb14fdfa0a63\/@t03B8ZRW\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Solid tumors,TIGIT,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17753"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Akram Obiedat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anas Atieh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guy Cinamon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keren Paz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paola Kucan Brilc<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lea Hirsl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tihana Lenac Roviš<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ofer Mandelboim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stipan Jonjic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Pini Tsukerman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Selinexor was evaluated for improved survival in tumor-bearing mice with hematological malignancies using EL-4 (T cell lymphoma\/leukemia) and C1498 (Acute myeloid leukemia) models. We hypothesized that selinexor increases survival by directly inducing tumor cell apoptosis and blocks immunosuppressive effects of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Mice were injected with 2&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> EL-4 or 1&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> C1498 cells intravenously followed by oral treatment with saline, vehicle, or different selinexor dosing schedules (5 mg\/kg weekly (5), twice weekly on Wed and Fri (5 d1\/3) or Mon and Fri (5 d1\/5) or 10 mg\/kg weekly (10). Selinexor was given by gavage. To examine the effect of selinexor on immune cells during tumor growth, Tumor bearing mice treated with vehicle or selinexor were euthanized at day 14 after tumor injection. Spleens were removed, single cell suspensions were isolated and the percentage of immune cells including MDSCs, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the production of interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Selinexor at 10, 5 d1\/3 and 5\/1\/5 weekly dosing significantly increased IFN-&#947; production by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells when compared to vehicle.

While both dosing schedules increased the percentage of IFN-&#947; positive T cells in tumor bearing mice suggesting that selinexor&#8217;s anti-cancer activity is not limited only to direct cytotoxic or cytostatic tumor cells. These data support the concept that once weekly selinexor, at a higher dose (10 mg\/kg (approximately 30 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) which is comparable to the clinical dose schedule (50-60 mg weekly) can modulate the immune system to target cancer cells and could be used alone or in combination with other immunotherapies to enhance the immune system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8c5241f7-0600-4f14-aed1-276ca4968789\/@u03B8ZRX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,T cell,Mouse models,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17755"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hemn Mohammadpour<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yosef Landesman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip McCarthy<\/i><\/presenter>.

Poor clinical results for ALK5 inhibitors and bifunctional fusion protein targeting TGF-&#946; and PD-L1 are also being reported in several clinical trials. Therefore, a novel therapeutic with superior efficacy differentiated from previous TGF-&#946; modulators will demonstrate significant clinical outcomes in combination with immuno-oncology therapeutics. In TME, TGF-&#946; and VEGF synergistically induce eradication of immunogenic tumors. Therefore, a dual-inhibitor targeting both ALK5 and VEGFR2 has high potential to demonstrate effective clinical efficacy against TGF-&#946;- and VEGF-enriched tumors as a single or combination treatment. TU2218 is a highly potent, orally available inhibitor against ALK5 and VEGFR2 with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 1.2 nM and 4.9 nM respectively. In a human PBMC assay, 0.5-1 &#956;M TU2218 treatment significantly enhanced IFN-&#947; production or IFN-&#947;-producing T lymphocytes number by TGF-&#946;-driven immunosuppression, but vactosertib, galunisertib and TGF-&#946; neutralizing antibody did not have significant effects. In a human regulatory T cells assay, CD4+CD25+ Tregs suppressed the proliferation of na&#239;ve CD4+CD25- T cells after TCR triggering. In contrast, 0.5 &#956;M TU2218 treated Tregs completely reversed the TCR-mediated proliferation of CD4+CD25- T cells. In addition, the immunomodulatory activity of TU2218 was analyzed on the co-culture system of cancer cells with human PBMC. In this assay, MCF&#8209;7 and HT-1080 displayed strong inhibitory effects on IFN-&#947; secretion of human PBMC, but TU2218 completely restored IFN-&#947; production compared with the poor effect of either vactosertib or TGF-&#946; neutralizing antibody. In an NK assay, TGF-&#946; reduced the level of surface proteins of NKG2D and NKp30 on CD56<sup>dim<\/sup> and CD56<sup>bright<\/sup> human primary NK cells and NK92 cell lines. TU2218 treatment completely reversed not only the inhibitory effect of TGF-&#946; on the expression of NKG2D but also TGF-&#946;-driven impairment of NK cytolytic activity for K562 cell lines on the co-culture system. Results show TU2218 possesses potent anti-cancer immune activities through boosting T and NK immunity as well as blocking Treg activity, implicating the mechanism of overcoming immune tolerance and reversing immunosuppression in TME. These effects of TU2218 in human immune cells would be a basis for novel combination options to develop promising therapeutics for patients with advanced cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f9fd0e8f-233f-4504-bdd4-47e07edf8023\/@u03B8ZRX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TGF-&#946;,Immuno-oncology,Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17757"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nam-Hoon Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seong-Ho Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jihyun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung-Hyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chan-Hee Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Won Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soyoun Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeongmin Seo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hun-Taek Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Different strategies have thus been explored to escape from immune evasion by depleting and\/or inactivating these regulatory cells. Given the immune-modulating effects of low doses of cyclophosphamide and adriamycin (CA), we assessed the efficacy of CA induction therapy to modulate the antitumor effect of the nivolumab in advanced NSCLC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This was a single center, open-label, single arm, phase II trial of nivolumab after CA induction therapy in previously treated advanced non-squamous NSCLC with PD-L1&#60;10%.

After 4 cycles of induction therapy nivolumab 480mg was administered every 4weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Assessments were performed every 4 weeks. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR); secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival(OS) and safety. Level of various immune cells including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), cytotoxic CD8+T-cell and regulatory T cells were measured by flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 22 patients were enrolled; the median age, 61 years old; female, 81%; adenocarcinoma histology, 76.2%; and current or former smoker, 26.9%. The ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were 9.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 -26.1)) and 22.7% (95% CI, 9.2-42.9) respectively. The median PFS and OS were 2.4 months (95% CI, 1.3-3.5) and 11.6 months (95% CI, 5.3-18.0) respectively. Though there were no significant safety signals during the trial, 72% of patients had grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities including neutropenia and anemia during CA combination. Regarding MDSC (HLA-DR-Lin-CD11b+CD33+) level, two patients with good response correlatively maintained the low ratio (&#60;1) of MDSC to CD8+T-cell throughout the treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our study didn&#8217;t meet the primary endpoint. However, CA induction prior to nivolumab showed an immune-modulating potential by decreasing MDSC in two responders. Further augmentation studies for enhancing ICIs response are warranted. As more patients gets ICIs, combination strategy with various immune modulator harbors great potential to eliminate the immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment architecture.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9216c4e0-d3b9-438e-9fa1-ae879d1f9d64\/@u03B8ZRX\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunomodulation,MDSC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17759"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Beung-Chul Ahn<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyae Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geon Kook Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang-Jin Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Eun Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyoungsuk Kwon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngjoo Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Youn Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although these therapies are initially effective, a significant proportion of patients exhibit resistance to treatment, therefore developing castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While immune checkpoint blockade therapies have led to remarkable clinical responses in patients with several tumor types, CRPC remains resistant to immunotherapy. The characterization of tumor resistance mechanisms has led to the identification of various tumor variants that could emerge along the progression of prostate cancer, including tumors undergoing phenotypic plasticity. Our laboratory has previously shown that phenotypic plasticity is a driver of resistance to immunotherapy. Here we investigated whether changes in tumor phenotype could affect the response of CRPC to immune-based therapies, and ways these mechanisms can be mitigated. Models of resistance to enzalutamide (LNCAP-EnzaR) or abiraterone (LNCAP-AbiR) were derived from the androgen sensitive LNCAP prostate cancer cell line. Resistant and parental LNCAP cells were comparatively evaluated for phenotypic features via RT-PCR, ELISA, western blot, immunofluorescence, and RNAseq analysis. Changes in the susceptibility to NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity were evaluated with NK cells isolated from peripheral blood from healthy donors. LNCAP-EnzaR and LNCAP parental cells were also grown in vivo in NSG MHCI\/II-deficient mice, and tumors were characterized for phenotypic markers and potential therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrated that acquisition of resistance to both enzalutamide and abiraterone was associated with a significant increase in mesenchymal tumor features, including increased levels of vimentin and fibronectin, and the loss of epithelial E-cadherin. The susceptibility of LNCAP-Enza-R and LNCAP-AbiR cells to NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) were significantly reduced (up to 90%), compared with parental cells. RNAseq analysis identified several upregulated gene and gene pathways, including estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), which was particularly overexpressed in LNCAP-EnzaR cells. In a xenograft model of LNCAP-EnzaR cells, we corroborated the maintenance of tumor phenotypic plasticity and the expression of actionable targets. Our data indicates that acquisition of resistance to AR inhibition is associated with significant reduction of susceptibility to immune attack, and the acquisition of tumor phenotypic plasticity features. Future studies plan to investigate approaches that revert tumor plasticity, including blockade of increased markers such as ESR1, TGF-beta or IL-8, for potential improvement of tumor susceptibility to immune attack in CRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a83b6457-a327-41ac-858a-20b716033c85\/@u03B8ZRX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Immunotherapy,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17760"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Madeline Dahut<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Fousek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucas Horn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiyan Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Schlom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Palena<\/i><\/presenter>.

The negative feedback role of HPK1 in TCR signaling makes it a promising target for immuno-oncology therapy. It has been recently demonstrated that the kinase activity of HPK1 is essential for its antitumor activity, and HPK1 inhibitors can be potentially combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (such as PD-1 antibody) for effective cancer treatment. Here, we report a potent and selective HPK1 inhibitor BGB-15025 which has been identified through in-house high throughput screening and structure-guided drug design. BGB-15025 potently inhibits HPK1 kinase activity in biochemical assay, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.04 nM under Km concentration of ATP. Consistently, BGB-15025 can potently reduce SLP76 phosphorylation and increase downstream ERK phosphorylation in a concentration dependent manner in T cells-based assay. As a consequence, BGB-15025 induces TCR activation and IL-2 production in T cells. Based on in-house profiling, BGB-15025 shows good selectivity profile among MAP4K family and does not affect ZAP70 phosphorylation up to 1 &#956;M. Oral administration of BGB-15025 demonstrates dose-dependent pSLP76 inhibition in splenic T cells and induces serum IL-2 in mouse model. In efficacy studies, BGB-15025 exhibits anti-tumor activity in GL261 tumor model as single agent. Moreover, BGB-15025 demonstrated combination effect with anti-PD-1 antibody in CT26 and EMT-6 syngeneic tumor models. BGB-15025 is currently in phase I clinical trial to treat patients with advanced solid tumor, both as a single agent and in combination with anti PD-1 antibody tislelizumab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/57ebe616-10d5-47a0-8cf8-0430f813c444\/@u03B8ZRX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,T cell,HPK1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17761"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ye Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhuo Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xing Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoxin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xitao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjia Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanzi Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaomin Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xi Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiwei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuesong Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

The IL-4\/IL-13 pathway induces an anti-inflammatory (Th2) response by stimulating M2 skewing of tumor associated macrophage (TAM) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), thereby supporting tumor growth by suppressing Th1 response. Therefore, inhibition of the IL-4\/IL-13 pathway has the potential to inhibit tumor growth by shifting the TME towards a pro-inflammatory response. To achieve this, we engineered a long-acting IL-13 super-antagonist (i.e., Fc-MDNA413) to target the IL-13R&#945;1 component of type II IL-4 receptor (IL-4R&#945;\/IL-13&#945;1) expressed on TAMs and MDSCs to inhibit their differentiation and expansion for immuno-oncological applications.<br \/>Experimental Procedure: Studies conducted include binding analyses by Biacore\/SPR, signaling analyses in IL-4\/IL-13 cell reporters, in vitro cell proliferation, in vitro M1\/M2 macrophage polarization and in vivo efficacy in syngeneic tumor models.<br \/>Summary of Data: IL-13R&#945;1 and IL-4R&#945; constitute the type II IL-4R that drives a Th2 response upon activation by IL-4 and IL-13. Binding studies showed that in comparison to wild-type Fc-IL13, Fc-MDNA413 has higher affinity for IL-13R&#945;1 but lower affinity for the decoy IL-13R&#945;2 receptor, indicating a more favorable receptor selectivity. In a cell-based reporter assay, Fc-MDNA413 inhibits both IL-4 and IL-13 induced p-STAT6 signaling, a pathway that drives towards a Th2 response. The antagonism of Fc-MDNA413 was also observed in an IL-13 dependent TF-1 proliferation assay where dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation was demonstrated. In a macrophage polarization assay with human primary myeloid cells, Fc-MDNA413 inhibited both IL-4 and IL-13 induced M2 polarization in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with an inhibitory effect on IL-4\/IL-13 signaling. Treatment of tumor bearing mice with Fc-MDNA413 inhibited tumor growth in multiple syngeneic tumor models (e.g., EMT6 breast cancer and KLN205 lung cancer) known to have higher percentage of TAMs and MDSCs in TME, hence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of this long-acting IL-4\/IL-13 super-antagonist.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>Fc-MDNA413 is a long-acting IL-4\/IL-13 super-antagonist that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 induced signaling and M2 skewing of macrophages, resulting in tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Ongoing studies include testing in additional syngeneic tumor models, deciphering in vivo mechanism of action and investigating potential synergy with other therapies. Next generation multifunctional superkines that incorporate IL-4\/IL-13 antagonism are under development to target immunologically challenging tumors. <b> <\/b><b> <\/b><b> <\/b><b> <\/b><b> <\/b><b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5cd0d9ba-4032-4ded-8771-8c7c5ee9c1ab\/@u03B8ZRX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cytokines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17762"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Aanchal Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manjunatha Ankathatti Munegowda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fahar Merchant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Minh D.

IL10 signaling through the natural ligand has both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects and this pleiotropy makes it difficult to develop wild type IL-10 for therapeutic use. In clinical trials that have studied IL10 in cancer, anemia, thrombocytopenia and hemophagocytosis associated with macrophage activation led to dose interruption and dose reduction. To drive more selective cytokine signaling only on cells of interest, we have generated surrogate cytokine agonists that bind to IL10R&#945; and IL2R&#947;, resulting in the selective activation of T cells over macrophages. We establish a novel means of bridging the IL10R&#945; and IL2R&#947; receptors using a IL10R&#945;\/IL2R&#947; surrogate cytokine agonist that consists of a domain that binds to IL10R&#945; and a second domain that binds to IL2R&#947;. Upon contact with a cell that allows bridging of IL10R&#945; and IL2R&#947;, the surrogate cytokine agonist causes the functional association of IL10R&#945; and IL2R&#947;, resulting in downstream signaling in select cell types.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: Human IL-10R&#945; and IL-2Ry specific single domain VHHs were generated by camel immunization and screening of VHH libraries prepared from peripheral blood cells for binding. Seven IL-10R&#945; VHHs and six IL-2Ry VHHs were identified and coupled as IL10R&#945;\/IL2Ry dual VHHs in an all by all matrix and in both amino-carboxy and carboxy-amino orientations, yielding 84 unique surrogate cytokine agonists. These surrogate cytokine agonists were screened on a (p)STAT3 assay on primary human cells and further tested in T cell and monocyte functional assays.<br \/>Results: Several IL10R&#945;\/IL2R&#947; surrogate cytokine agonists were biologically active on primary human lymphoid cells, inducing (p)STAT3 signal in B cells, NK cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells with little to no (p)STAT3 signal in monocytes. These IL10R&#945;\/IL2R&#947; surrogate cytokine agonists were also functionally active in promoting cell survival and at inducing IFN-&#947; and Granzyme production by CD8 T cell blasts generated upon CD3\/CD28 activation. Consistent with the lack of STAT3 signaling in monocytes, the IL10R&#945;\/IL2R&#947; surrogate cytokine agonists did not inhibit LPS induced secretion of IL1&#946; and TNF&#945; by monocytes, suggesting selectivity and a lack of immunosuppressive activities.<br \/>Conclusions: Designing surrogate cytokine agonists that pair non-natural cytokine receptors provides the possibility of generating molecules that can decouple the pleiotropy of cytokines like IL10 by stimulating only the desired cell population. Here, we have generated IL10R&#945;\/IL2R&#947; surrogate cytokine agonists that are biologically active and signal with varying strengths in the lymphoid cells with little to no activity on monocytes, thus providing an opportunity to decouple the pleiotropy of IL10 for use in cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b2ff032e-9be4-4a21-9832-96f5e8f76eca\/@v03B8ZRY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-10,Interleukin-2,Monocyte,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17764"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mahalakshmi Ramadass<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandro Vivona<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepti Rokkam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heiko Greb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anu Gangopadhyay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Romina Riener<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rene De Waal Malefyt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Lupardus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Oft<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Kastelein<\/i><\/presenter>.

At present, there is limited understanding of irAE mechanisms, hampering development of approaches to mitigate their damage. We addressed this problem by generating animal models of intestinal irAE. Our results show that disruption of homeostatic immunity by genetic predisposition to intestinal inflammation or acute gastrointestinal infection sensitizes mice to anti-CTLA-4-mediated intestinal toxicity. Inflammation-prone mice treated with anti-CTLA-4 showed neutrophil accumulation, systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6) release, and dysbiosis. Significantly, IL-6 blockade combined with antibiotic treatment improved anti-CTLA-4 therapeutic efficacy and reduced intestinal irAEs. Immune signatures were validated in biopsies from patients who developed colitis during ICB, supporting the utility of our models. This study provides new pre-clinical models, mechanistic insight into irAEs, and potential approaches to enhance ICB efficacy while mitigating irAEs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9796e5a3-6be2-4422-b624-7e11432fb300\/@v03B8ZRY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,CTLA-4,Interleukin-6,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17765"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yifan Zhou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yusra B.

Although this resistance mechanism is not fully defined, previous work has suggested a role for increased infiltration of suppressive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. We investigated the ability of various treatments to alter immunosuppression associated with STK11 mutations to inform future treatment strategies in NSCLC.<br \/>Comparison of STK11 mt and wt cell lines revealed 10-1,000-fold increased levels of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 in STK11 mt lines. STK11 mt lines were treated with inhibitors of clinically actionable pathways (MEKi, ERKi, or EGFRi at 0.001-10 uM) and evaluated for changes in cell growth and cytokine production. Treatment with EGFRi significantly decreased IL-6 and IL-8 (&#8805;25 fold) and inhibited cell growth (2-3 fold decreased IC50) in STK11 mt lines, which is particularly interesting since STK11 mt lines are EGFR wt. Both MEKi and ERKi also reduced cytokine production (&#8804;7 fold for MEKi, &#8804;2 fold for ERKi), but neither recapitulated the magnitude of the changes observed with EGFRi. Genomic changes associated with increased sensitivity of STK11 mt lines to EGFRi included down-regulation (&#8805; 1.5-fold) of genes involved in EGFR signaling (<i>BTC<\/i>), as well as neutrophil and Treg recruitment (<i>CXCL8, PPRB, CXCL1, CCL20<\/i>). These alterations were associated with a substantial reduction of infiltrating neutrophils in a tumor spheroid model using STK11 mt NSCLC lines treated with EGFRi compared to control (0.8% vs. 13.6%).<br \/>The in vitro effects of EGFRi were confirmed in vivo in STK11 mt NSCLC PDX models. Treatment with 100mg\/kg of EGFRi led to 30% tumor growth inhibition compared to vehicle control and a decrease (&#8805;1.7 fold) in cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL5) involved in recruitment of suppressive immune cells by day 13. The effect of this modification in cytokine secretion was an observed decrease (2.2 fold) in the absolute count of mMDSCs in tumors from EGFRi treated mice compared to vehicle control at day 7. A decrease in inflammatory cytokines and MDSCs was also observed with a lower dose of 6.25mg\/kg of EGFRi.<br \/>Our results suggest that EGFRi decreases cytokines\/chemokines responsible for recruiting and maintaining neutrophils and other immunosuppressive cells in the TME of STK11 mt NSCLC. This, combined with the reduced growth of STK11 mt cells, indicate that EGFRi may promote important changes in the TME that could overcome innate resistance to checkpoint inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e286e4d-2fdf-4ae2-82f1-3ba36cc4699e\/@v03B8ZRY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Tumor microenvironment,STK11 mutation,LKB1 mutation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17767"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yelena Lazdun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lydia Greenlees<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Song Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Holoweckyj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fernanda Pilataxi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susana Hayes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon Higgs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie Streicher<\/i><\/presenter>.

Previously, we developed PB101, a novel glycosylated decoy receptor that can neutralize VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF, and demonstrated that it potently inhibits tumor angiogenesis, thereby retarding tumor growth and metastasis. However, its impact on tumor microenvironment (TME), especially anti-cancer immunity, has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated distinct modes of immune modulation by PB101 compared with other anti-angiogenic agents, and evaluated its immunotherapeutic potential when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> MC38 colon or Hepa-V liver cancer-bearing mice were treated with PB101 or other anti-angiogenic agents with or without various ICIs. The TME was evaluated by histologic, flow cytometric, and Nanostring immune profiling analyses.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> PB101 markedly suppressed MC38 colon and Hepa-V liver cancer growth in vivo. It simultaneously inhibited both VEGF and PlGF signaling within the TME, thus suppressing tumor angiogenesis. PB101 also induced extensive immune remodeling of the TME. PB101 enhanced intratumoral dendritic cells, but reduced M2-like tumor-associated macrophages. Moreover, PB101 resulted in high influx of activated CD8<sup>+<\/sup>, but not CD4<sup>+<\/sup>, T cells into the TME. PB101 exhibited the most prominent immune-modulating effect compared with other vascular targeting agents. When combined with various ICIs, PB101 had the greatest synergism with anti-PD-L1 antibody, inducing complete tumor regression and long-term survival. Furthermore, PB101-based combination immunotherapy induced a durable and protective immunity against subcutaneous tumor re-challenge and hematogenous lung metastasis.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>PB101 elicited strong anti-tumor immunity more effectively than other anti-angiogenic agents.

We have identified and characterized a wide panel of first-in-class highly selective TNFR2 agonist and antagonist antibodies, from murine hybridoma and camelid phage display campaigns. Our Treg antagonist lead candidate IAT0981-1A8 is a humanized single domain antibody (VHH), which showed tight TNFR2 binding with low-digit nanomolar affinity. IAT0981-1A8 potently blocked ligand TNFa binding to TNFR2, and elicited strong Treg proliferation inhibition activities. Our Teff agonist lead candidate IAT0981-231 is a humanized monoclonal antibody with sub-nanomolar affinity to TNFR2, which potently stimulated CD8+ T cell activation, proliferation and cytokine secretion, without blocking endogenous TNFa activity. Both IAT0981-1A8 and IAT0981-231 did not cross-react with TNFR1, and exhibited extremely potent tumor growth inhibition activities as single agent in multiple tumor models in TNFR2 transgenic animals, better than tested benchmarks. Our epitope binning studies demonstrated that IAT0981-1A8 and IAT0981-231 bound to totally different epitopes on TNFR2. We also evaluated several bispecific antibodies composing of tumor associated antigens or other immune cell modulators in tumor microenvironment, with either IAT0981-1A8 or IAT0981-231. We have generated high quality commercial stable cell line for the Teff agonist lead candidate IAT0981-231, and completed several batches of 200L non-GMP and GMP production. Our preclinical cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies revealed extremely good safety profile for IAT0981-231, with no significant toxicity observed even with high 200mg\/kg repeated dose. We are currently performing IND-enabling studies for the agonist lead candidate IAT0981-231, and aim to enter clinical studies in the first half of 2022, with first-in-class potential as monotherapy and I\/O combination therapy for advanced cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5974787b-0d6c-4b38-bc3c-cefbb551d9b9\/@v03B8ZRY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;),Regulatory T cells,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17769"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaoling Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chonging Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Liusong Yin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Standard of care for patients at different stages of SCLC includes radiation, etoposide, cisplatin\/carboplatin, and atezolizumab. However, relapse is quite common. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a more effective treatment. Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) is a target selectively expressed in SCLC rather than normal tissue. We have developed an anti-DLL3\/CD3 bispecific antibody QLS31904 that is engineered to direct and activate T cells through CD3 to kill SCLC cells expressing DLL3.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> Tumor cell killing, T cell activation, and cytokine production of QLS31904 in a concentration range were assessed in the presence of SCLC cells and human T cells in vitro. Antitumor activity of QLS31904 was evaluated in SCLC xenograft models, in which NCG mice were co-implanted with SHP-77 and human T cells first, then treated with intraperitoneal QLS31904 or control IgG1AA isotype. The in vivo tumor growth inhibition was assessed. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed in non-human primates (NHP). The cross-reactivity of QLS31904 with NHP DLL3 and CD3 were established, and the tolerability was also evaluated in NHP model.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> QLS31904 displayed the anticipated bispecific binding properties and mediated potent and selective lysis of DLL3-positive cancer cell lines through recruitment and activation of human T cells. No cytokine activation was observed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cell alone. In xenograft models, QLS31904 induced significant tumor growth inhibition at doses as low as 20 &#181;g\/kg, including complete regression of established tumors. QLS31904 exhibits about 100 hours of T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> in NHP, supporting feasibility of weekly dosing. QLS31904 was well tolerated with no related adverse &#64257;ndings up to the highest tested dose (five weekly doses of 10mg\/kg) in NHP.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> QLS31904 has an impressive ef&#64257;cacy and safety pro&#64257;le in the preclinical studies, making it a potentially viable option for DLL3-expressing SCLC in the clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1bd7e91b-3868-4d12-ad98-f0b9ba602cba\/@v03B8ZRY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Delta-like ligand 3,CD3,QLS31904,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17770"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liuqing Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruimei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiahua Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongliang Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongxiu Ge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ting Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuyong Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is suggested that claudin 18.2 is an ideal target for cancer therapy. Anti-claudin 18.2 antibody IMAB362 has achieved remarkable success in the latest clinical trials. Multiple anti-claudin 18.2 monoclonal antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy targeting claudin 18.2 have also entered phase I clinical trials. CD3 is a receptor that is present on the surface of T cells and is involved in the antigen recognition by T cells as well as in signal transduction. Anti-claudin 18.2\/CD3 bispecific antibody can recruit T cells to tumor sites, activating T cells to kill tumor cells with high claudin 18.2 expression to improve efficacy. Here, we describe a new T cell-redirecting antibody (QLS31905) that is bispecific for claudin 18.2 and CD3. QLS31905 showed a potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against claudin 18.2-positive engineered cell lines HEK293-hCLDN18.2 and NCI-N87 CLDN18.2 as well as superior in vivo efficacy in humanized NCI-N87 CLDN18.2 model. Furthermore, QLS31905 was safe and well tolerated in a 4-week repeated dose (up to 10&#8201;mg\/kg) toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. In vitro cytokine release was lower in the QLS31905 group than that in the AMG 910 (another anti-claudin18.2\/CD3 bispecific antibody) group. Overall, these data suggested that QLS31905 has similar efficacy to AMG 910 and is safer. QLS31905 may be an effective and clinically valuable treatment for patients with claudin 18.2-positive gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6c30010a-a0ee-4d07-ab09-832c1a5643b2\/@w03B8ZRZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,QLS31905,Claudin 18.2,CD3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17771"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiahua Jiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meimei Si<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongjun Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaodan Yan<\/i><\/presenter>.

While immunotherapy operates through a broad class of mechanisms, modulating immune checkpoints have provided some of the most effective approaches, including inhibition of PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway, CTLA-4, LAG-3, OX40, Tim-3, KIR and TIGIT to reverse tumor immune escape.OX40, also known as CD134 or TNFRSF4, is a membrane protein expressed in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, neutrophils and NK cells. In the process of T cell activation, OX40 plays a synergistic stimulating function by binding with ligand OX40L. OX40 agonist immunotherapy has been previously shown to improve the survival rate of glioblastoma in mice, prevent tumor growth in ovarian cancer, increase the prognostic significance of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cell infiltration in colorectal cancer, and eliminate the inhibitory function of Foxp3<sup>+<\/sup> Treg cells that constitutively Express OX40. On the contrary, blocking OX40 axis is a promising strategy to treat T cell hyperactivation in autoimmune diseases. As recently reported in the literature, a two-armed, random, double blinded phase 2b clinical trial demonstrated that telazorlimab, an antagonist OX40 antibody developed by Ichnos Sciences, met primary efficacy endpoints in treating atopic dermatitis.In this research, we developed a set of novel antibodies to OX40 using a hybridoma and VHH synthetic library; the set of antibodies includes both agonists and antagonists.We developed one hybridoma origin mAb into a human framework. Agonist activity was equal to MOXR0916 in NF- &#954;B reporter-Jurkat assay, dependent on coupling by proteinA\/cell-bound CD32b, non-competing with OX40L, and epitope mapped to domain 2+3.We identified dozens of binders from our synthetic single domain VH library. After construction into a IgG1Fc fusion form, 4 VHHs were obtained with significant agonistic activity, dependent on coupling by proteinA\/cell bound CD32b. Another 5 VHHs were also obtained with significant antagonistic activity without coupling by proteinA\/cell-bound CD32b. The 4 agonistic VHHs were confirmed with binding to domain 1+2, competitive to OX40L&#8217;s binding.These VHHs constructs represent a promising set of novel biologics to modulate OX40&#8212;as agonists or antagonists&#8212;and serve as the basis for development of potential new therapies in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f2f88011-0802-45d4-9258-07fb99f10a44\/@w03B8ZRZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"OX40,Antibody,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17772"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chenguang Cai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shin-Chen Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guoqian Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ting Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fengzhi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiying Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuang Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>You'you Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feizheng Xue<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, single targeting therapies showed a poor median response likely due to loss of antigen expression upon treatment stress. CD19&#38;CD22 dual targeting antibody drug conjugate can be a powerful killer of B-cell cancers, with more targeted patient populations due to the high expression of CD19, and good anti-tumor efficacy due to the high internalizing ability of CD22.To this end, we developed 7E11-13G9, which is a bispecific antibody designed for antibody-drug-conjugate for a larger market of B-cell hematological cancers.By the strong CD19 binding arm of 7E11 and the efficient CD22-mediated internalizing arm of 13G9, 7E11-13G9 BsAb kills more tumor cells with high potency and efficacy. In tumor cell killing assay, bispecific 7E11-13G9 showed significantly better anti-tumor efficacy than any of the benchmark antibodies, and even better than the combination of the anti-CD19 benchmark Loncastuximab with the anti-CD22 benchmark Inotuzumab. Significantly better anti-tumor effect and delayed tumor recurrence of CD19-CD22 bispecific compared with single target was demonstrated in Nalm6 acute lymphocyte leukemia model. 7E11-13G9 BsAb is stable and has good productivity in transient expression. Proof of concept study of antibody drug conjugate based on 7E11-13G9 was prepared, and showed great anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9c349fe8-8284-49f1-8576-f7e41d93ef6d\/@w03B8ZRZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias,Lymphoma,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17773"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liang Du<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tingting Wan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jijun Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Some variants of CEACAMs such as CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 have long been recognized to be overexpressed in many cancers and highly associated with cancer development. Immunotherapies targeting CEACAM have achieved some clinical benefit, e.g. Tusamitamab Ravtansine (anti-CEACAM5 ADC), that has shown decent disease control in NSCLC. Recently, with the success of CAR-T and T cell engager (TCE) therapies against blood cancers, TCEs against solid tumors have also been developed. For instance, Cibisatamab, targeting CEACAM5 and CD3, is currently under clinical investigation in CRC patients. Here, we report the discovery of a bispecific antibody (biAb) anti-CEACAM5\/6 x CD3 that mediates direct T cell killing against CEACAM5- and\/or CEACAM6-expressing cancer cells.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Anti-CEACAM5\/6 x CD3 TCE consists of two CEACAM5\/6 binding Fabs for the preferential recognition of CEACAM5\/6-high-expressing cancer cells, and one CD3 binding domain that permits CEACAM5\/6-mediated CD3 crosslinking and T cell activation. To reduce off-target T cell stimulation there is no CH2 in this format to eliminate Fc receptor binding, while an anti-HSA VHH was included into this construct for half-life extension. Binding affinity and specificity were studied by flow cytometry, IHC and on the Retrogenix Cell Microarray Technology platform, a human membrane\/secreted protein binding array. The immunomodulatory functions were evaluated using luciferase reporter cell assays, cell killing assays <i>in vitro<\/i> and via PBMC-based Hu-NSG mouse models <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Our CEACAM5\/6 binding antibody only interacted with CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 on the Retrogenix Cell Microarray against over 5,500 proteins. Importantly, it showed a similar sensitivity to recognize CRC tumor tissues in an IHC array as the benchmark (BMK), but significantly better selectivity at recognition of tumor tissues vs. normal tissues. Next, <i>in vitro<\/i> testing illustrated CEACAM5\/6-mediated T cell activation by the TCE, and such stimulation also correlated with the binding affinity of the anti-CD3 domain. The lead candidate with the optimized CD3 binding affinity, showed better anti-tumor efficacy than the BMK in mice. Furthermore, this molecule displayed a typical PK as a conventional antibody with a mean T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> of around 115hrs. Finally, we show high tolerance in NHP of which no obvious signs of toxicity were observed at 2.5 mg\/kg.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In summary, a bispecific TCE with high selectivity to CEACAM5\/6 overexpressing cancer cells was engineered.

Claudin-18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2), a membrane-bound protein involved in the formation of tight junctions, has been identified to be highly expressed in various types of cancers such as gastric and pancreatic cancer. Targeting CLDN18.2 with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) Zolbetuximab has achieved moderate clinical benefit with controllable toxicity. 4-1BB is a potent stimulator of T cells and NK cells, and when activated, can improve effector and\/or memory responses. However, inherent on-target related toxic effects in the liver was observed during the clinical development of the monoclonal agonist antibody Urelumab. Here, we report the discovery of a humanized bispecific antibody (biAb) anti-CLDN18.2 x 4-1BB, which activates immune cells such as T cells via CLDN18.2-mediated crosslinking of 4-1BB. This bispecific antibody induces potent anti-tumor efficacy with limited toxicity.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The anti-CLDN18.2 x 4-1BB biAb was generated by the fusion of an anti-4-1BB VHH targeting the CRD4 domain for 4-1BB, to the C-terminus of an anti-CLDN18.2 mAb via a G4S linker. Binding affinity and specificity testing of each arm were studied by flow cytometry and on the Retrogenix Cell Microarray Technology platform, a human membrane\/secreted protein binding array. The immunomodulatory functions were evaluated using luciferase reporter cell assays <i>in vitro<\/i> and human 4-1BB KI mouse models <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> The CLDN18.2 antibody interacted specifically to CLDN18.2 on the Retrogenix Cell Microarray platform among over 5,500 proteins. Next, <i>in vitro<\/i> studies showed how the molecule specifically induced T cell activation and cytokine release against CLDN18.2-positive cells. More importantly, such activation was correlated to the expression level of CLDN18.2, which indicates that the molecule may preferentially recognize CLDN18.2-high-expressing cancer cells. In mouse models, the anti-CLDN18.2 x 4-1BB biAb induced superior anti-tumor efficacy compared to anti-CLDN18.2 and anti-4-1BB mAbs alone with acceptable PK attributes. Furthermore, the anti-CLDN18.2 x 4-1BB biAb induced strong immunological memory where tumors could not grow in re-challenged tumor-free mice. Finally, the CLDN18.2 x 4-1BB biAb showed a safe profile in a GLP NHP study of which no obvious signs of toxicity were observed at 50 mg\/kg, 100 mg\/kg or 150 mg\/kg doses.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Conclusion:<\/b> In summary, a bispecific antibody targeting CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB was developed, which displayed potent anti-tumor efficacy with strong immunological memory and has shown good safety in NHPs.

The effects of CXCL16 on tumor behavior is controversial and showed tissue-specific manners. In breast cancers, previous studies have showed that CXCL16 mainly originated from mesenchymal stromal cells or cancer-associated fibroblasts and played pro-tumorigenic roles. CXCL16 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) in TCGA dataset for breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of CXCL16 neutralizing antibody and its mechanisms in TNBC. To establish a xenograft mouse model of TNBC, MDA-MB-231 cells were injected subcutaneously to athymic nude mice, and mice were randomized into anti-CXCL16 and control groups. When measurable tumors were established, anti-CXCL16 neutralizing antibody (CLS-A101, cellus inc.) or control IgG were intravenously injected. Tumor growth was significantly delayed in the anti-CXCL16 group than the control group by 67% for 3 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis showed that macrophages (CD11b+F4\/80+ cells) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC, CD11b+GR1+ cells) were decreased in the anti-CXCL16 group than the control group. Histologic examination showed that anti-CXCL16 antibody significantly reduced tumor vessel formation and decreased macrophage infiltration in both intra- and peri-tumoral area. Collectively, treatment of anti-CXCL16 antibody reduced tumor growth by inhibiting macrophage and MDSC infiltration following reduced tumor angiogenesis. To explore the mechanistic insight into the monotherapy of anti-CXCL16 antibody, we further analyzed the metabolic changes. In human tumor tissues, TNBC harboring high expression of CXCL16 showed significant shift of glutamine metabolism pathway-related genes (upregulation of <i>GLS <\/i>and downregulation of <i>GLUL<\/i>, <i>GLUD1<\/i>, and <i>GLUD2<\/i>) toward accumulating glutamate. For cellular experiments, CXCL16-enriched cancer\/macrophage co-cultured conditioned medium (co-CM) or cancer single-cultured conditioned medium (s-CM) were treated to cancer cells, and glutamine and glutamate levels were measured. In MDA-MB-231 cells, co-CM treatment significantly enhanced glutamate\/glutamine ratio and anti-CXCL16 antibody significantly decreased it. Consistently, glutamate measures in tumor lysates from TNBC xenograft were lower in the anti-CXCL16 group than the control group. In conclusion, anti-CXCL16 antibody (CLS-A101) inhibited immune suppressive myeloid cell infiltration followed tumor angiogenesis and glutamate productions in cancer cells. These dual actions on both tumor immune microenvironment and cancer cell metabolism enables anti-CXCL16 antibody to be a potential monotherapy for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/508e0656-cb0e-4c89-ae00-871bce870a39\/@w03B8ZRZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,Immunotherapy,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17776"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Min Joo Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Jin Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geun-Hyung Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seong Keun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Wook Cho<\/i><\/presenter>. cellus Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of, cellus Inc., Daegu, Korea, Republic of, Seoul National University Hostpital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"09979de3-bbc6-4188-bfe3-b97abb6ee88b","ControlNumber":"4306","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Here, we generated a CLDN6 X 4-1BB bispecific antibody (BsAb) which could conditionally activate T cells through 4-1BB stimulation upon CLDN6 engagement, positioning it as a potential novel immunotherapy for ovarian cancer and other CLDN6 positive tumors.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> CLDN6 X 4-1BB BsAb was evaluated for its antigen binding through cell-based binding assay. <i>In vitro<\/i> function of the antibody was confirmed in a 4-1BB signaling reporter assay and primary human PBMC assay. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy of the antibody was further demonstrated in 4-1BB humanized syngeneic mouse model. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> analysis of tumor infiltrating and peripheral immune cells was conducted by FACS.

Functional evaluation of CLDN6X4-1BB BsAb indicated that the activation of 4-1BB signaling was dependent on CLDN6 expression on tumor cells and the activity was stronger than reference 4-1BB monoclonal antibody urelumab. In a humanized 4-1BB mouse model, CLDN6X4-1BB BsAb showed tumor growth inhibition superior to the combination of anti-CLDN6 and anti-4-1BB monospecific antibodies, and the treatment effect was associated with an increase in tumor infiltrating CD45 and CD8 cells as well as CD8\/Treg ratio. From the safety perspective, there were no significant changes in liver enzymes or liver histopathology following repeated BsAb administration, suggesting little risks for liver toxicity commonly induced by other 4-1BB agonist antibodies.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> We have successfully generated a novel CLDN6-targeted 4-1BB bispecific antibody which could induce potent 4-1BB stimulation and anti-tumor activity in a CLDN6-dependent manner while minimizing the risk of liver toxicity.

However, despite its remarkable curative effects, serious immune-related adverse reactions limit the clinical application of CD40 agonists. Crosslinking-dependent activation is one of the promising approaches to diminish the adverse effects of CD40 agonists. Agonistic CD40 stimulation on antigen presenting cells (APCs) not only promotes activation of T cells, but also results in PD-L1 upregulation on APCs, thus creating a negative feedback loop to dampen the anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of CD40 agonist and blockade of PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction may further induce a synergistic effect on T cell activation and anti-tumor activity. Here, we report a novel PD-L1xCD40 Bispecific Antibody (BsAb) designed to have synergistic curative effects as well as improved safety profiles. The PD-L1\/CD40 BsAb was generated using the Harbour HBICE<sup>TM<\/sup>&#174; platform. It exhibited superior binding activities to both PD-L1 and CD40, respectively. CD40 activation was fully relied on the PD-L1 crosslinking. The PD-L1xCD40 BsAb showed potent tumor growth inhibition in preclinical efficacy models. Meanwhile, it showed much improved safety profile compared to a reference anti-CD40 agonistic antibody in the preclinical tox models. Overall, the PD-L1xCD40 BsAb demonstrated remarkable <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy and improved safety profiles in preclinical models, which presents it as a promising candidate for the development of next-generation cancer immune therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d89f3fe-7620-4a5d-b4a9-80ddaf45cf7d\/@w03B8ZRZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD40,PD-L1,Bispecific antibody,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17779"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haishan Luo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zihong Meng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jimmy Rong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuandong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunxing Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youhong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gang Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yebo He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Gan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yiping Rong<\/i><\/presenter>.

We previously showed that T cells expressing a multichain CAR design that uses an activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domain co-expressed with the ITAM-containing adapter, DAP12 (KIR-CAR) are able to control large, pre-established tumors that cannot be controlled by 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation CD3&#950;-based CAR T cells. This improved function is associated with maintenance of KIR-CAR expression on the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes compared with CD3&#950;-based CARs. In the present study, we explored the mechanism for the improved KIR-CAR expression, which we hypothesized was related to reduced receptor internalization following receptor activation compared with standard CD3&#950;-based CARs. To monitor receptor dynamics at the T cell surface, we took advantage of a surface protein tagging method that employs the SpyCatcher-SpyTag system to construct a KIR-based or CD3&#950;-based CAR with the ability to pulse label the CAR at the cell surface with a fluorescent molecule. In this approach, a CAR ectodomain comprised of a SpyCatcher domain is linked to either the KIR TM and cytoplasmic domain (SpyKIR-CAR) or CD28 TM and cytoplasmic domain with CD3&#950; (SpyCAR). The antigenic specificity of the CAR is conferred by addition of a fluorescently-labeled binder comprised of an antibody-like Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) fused to a SpyTag sequence (SpyDARPin) that specifically binds the spyCatcher domain covalently via its spyTag and recognizes the EGFR antigen. The SpyKIR-CAR or Spy-CAR expression is confirmed by flow cytometry using an antibody to a myc-tag within the DARPin sequence. Uniform fluorescence labeling at the plasma membrane is observed following addition of the SpyDARPin as assessed by image cytometry and confocal microscopy. The kinetics of SpyCAR or SpyKIR-CAR fluorescence loss were similar in the absence of EGFR ligand with a half-life of 2 days consistent with normal membrane turnover by pinocytosis. Upon ligand-induced CAR activation, the SpyCAR fluorescence rapidly reduced beginning at 30 min post-activation to background fluorescence levels of unlabeled SpyCAR cells within 8 hours of activation. In contrast, the mean SpyKIR-CAR fluorescence showed no change in fluorescence at 30 min, while exhibiting a reduction to 80% of the mean baseline fluorescence at 8 hours and 4-fold above the background fluorescence. Confocal imaging confirmed the retention of labeled KIR-CAR at the plasma membrane over the time frame in which the labeled SpyCAR is lost. Our data support differences in CAR internalization upon activation as an important mechanism underlying the enhanced function of KIR-CAR T cells in solid tumors compared with traditional CD3&#950;-based CAR designs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/768b21af-dc57-457b-a7f7-77f5396096e2\/@w03B8ZRZ\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CAR T cells,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17780"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qian Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Nigel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alvin Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morgan Hresko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Minutolo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Powell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael C.

Telomerase is responsible for elongating telomere length and prolonging cellular lifespan as well as acting as a transcriptional modulator in cancer signaling pathways. Because of its enhanced expression in primary tumor cells as well as incipient tumor-initiating stem cells and with limited distribution in normal somatic cells, the catalytic component of telomerase, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), is regarded as a high-impact target for immunotherapeutic agents and vaccines. In order to derive a mouse TERT (mTERT)-specific vaccine which could be useful in a preventive approach, we implemented an epitope-mapping stratagem by which pools of 30-mer peptides overlapping by 5 spanning the entire mTERT sequence were used to immunize C57BL\/6 mice. Several immunogenic peptides were identified by matrixed peptide pool IFN-&#611; ELISPOT screening in a 2-part process that first identified positive pools, then identified individual peptides. 15-mer and 31-mer versions of the top 7 immunogenic mTERT peptides were synthesized and used as a peptide pool combined separately with several adjuvants to optimize immunogenicity. Results suggested a peptide sequence-specific preference for TLR3-mediated Hiltonol versus TLR9-mediated CpG-based adjuvants. In addition, the majority of T cell responses specific to the TERT peptides was identified through flow cytometry as belonging to the CD4 compartment, although one class I-restricted epitope was also identified. Multifunctional CD4+ T cells expressing IFN-&#611;, TNF-&#945;, IL-2, and CD107a were identified specific to several mTERT peptides. In vivo cytotoxic effects exerted on TERT peptide pool-loaded target cells were also uncovered that were specific to a CpG-adjuvanted version of the vaccine. Finally, multiple versions of the mTERT peptide\/adjuvant vaccine with highest immunogenicity scores are being tested in a syngeneic graft mouse model using subcutaneous implantation of lung cancer-derived SPON10 cells expressing mTERT. If proven efficacious, these results will support the feasibility of a TERT peptide\/adjuvant approach for prophylactically engendering broad antitumor immunity to TERT-expressing cancers.

While the antitumor activity of bifunctional anti-PD-L1\/transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;) fusion protein bintrafusp alfa (M7824) in preclinical studies is well known, clinical studies to date with M7824 have led to limited success. QLS31901 is another bifunctional fusion protein composed of the truncated extracellular domain of the TGF-&#946; receptor II fused to the C-terminus of humanized anti-PD-L1 heavy chain (&#945;PD-L1) with function as a &#8220;trap&#8221; for all three TGF-&#946; isoforms and the blockage of PD-L1 immunosuppressive pathway. The present study demonstrated its superior antitumor activity over M7824 in a humanized MDA-MB-231 model. Furthermore, toxicology studies of QLS31901 only showed a transient interleukin 6 elevation. There were no other cytokine release and organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys.

However, anti-mesothelin CAR-T cells have shown limited efficacy in patients. Since most antibodies to mesothelin bind the membrane distal epitopes we generated antibodies that bind mesothelin in a membrane-proximal region. We hypothesize that CAR-T cells recognizing a membrane proximal epitope on mesothelin will be more efficacious.<br \/><b>Study Design:<\/b> We developed CAR-T cells targeting a membrane-distal (SS1CAR-T) and a membrane-proximal epitope (hYP218 CAR-T) of mesothelin. Using mesothelin-expressing cancer cell lines, anti-tumor efficacy of CAR-T cells was assessed in vitro by measuring direct killing of tumor cells by the CAR-T cells and quantifying cytokine-release by the CAR-T cells. In vivo anti-tumor efficacy of CAR-T was determined in NSG mice using three different solid tumor models of high-mesothelin expression: ovarian cancer (OVCAR-8), pancreatic cancer (KLM-1), and mesothelioma patient-derived xenograft (NCI-Meso63). Blood and tumor infiltration of CAR-T cells in vivo was determined via flow cytometry analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Upon co-culture with tumor cells with high mesothelin expression (A431-H9, OVCAR-8, KLM-1, H226, NCI-Meso63, NCI-Meso29), hYP218 CAR-T cells killed cancer cells more efficiently than SS1 CAR-T cells, with a 2-4-fold lower ET<sub>50<\/sub> value (Effector to Target ratio for 50% killing of tumor cells). Additionally, compared to SS1 CAR-T cells, hYP218 CAR-T cells secreted significantly higher level of cytokines (IL-2, TNF&#945;, IFN&#947;) in a co-culture with tumor cells. In three solid tumor models, single treatment of tumor-bearing mice with hYP218 CAR-T cells lead to improved tumor response and survival compared to SS1 CAR-T, with complete regression of OVCAR-8 and NCI-Meso63 tumors. Compared to SS1 CAR-T cells, higher hYP218 CAR-T cell infiltration was detected both in the blood and tumors isolated from hYP218 CAR-T treated mice seven days post-treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We demonstrate that hYP218 CAR-T cells targeting a membrane-proximal epitope of mesothelin are more potent than similar CAR-T cells targeting a membrane distal epitope.

Clinical trials over the years have reported severe on-target off-tumor toxicities associated with CAR T cell therapies targeting tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Here, we propose a strategy to target TAAs effectively and safely: 1) improve tumor-targeting specificity by affinity-tuning; 2) armor T cells with antigen-dependent expression of interleukin-12 (IL-12) to compensate loss of CAR T cell activity caused by affinity-tuning. In this system, IL-12 expression is tightly regulated by the nuclear factor of the activated T cells promoter (NFAT) to limit IL-12 to the environ of activated affinity-tuned CAR T cells within the tumor. We demonstrate here the feasibility of this strategy using epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) as a model TAA.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Affinity variants were generated by alanine scanning mutagenesis in the complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) of an EpCAM antibody (UBS54). The affinity of CAR variants was determined by flow cytometry-based saturation binding assay. On-target off-tumor cytotoxicity of CAR T cells was examined against human primary normal epithelial cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated in mouse models of gastric cancer with cell line-derived (SNU-638 and MKN-45) and patient-derived xenografts.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Substitution of alanine into the UBS54 CDR3 led to identification of a tyrosine (6th residue in heavy chain CDR3) as a hot spot for affinity tuning. Among several more subtle amino acid substitutions for Tyr-6, we found that CAR molecule with valine substituent (Y6V) possesses 10 &#181;M affinity toward EpCAM, rendering CAR T cells to be selective to EpCAM-high tumors while being not reactive to primary normal epithelial cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. In gastric cancer mouse models, compared to UBS54 CAR T cells that mediated rapid tumor remission, Y6V CAR T cells produced mainly partial responses. To revitalize affinity-tuned CAR T cells, we further engineered CAR T cells to release IL-12 under NFAT. We found that both the activity of the NFAT promoter and the level of IL-12 release were tightly regulated by the antigen density of targets when inducible IL-12 is combined with 10 &#181;M affinity Y6V CAR; however, such dependence is lost when 1 &#181;M affinity UBS54 was examined. In mouse models of gastric cancer, inducible lL-12 armored Y6V CAR T cells produced enhanced anti-tumor responses without elevating systemic exposure to IL-12, evidenced by low levels of IL-12 in mouse sera (below 100 pg\/ml).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Combination of affinity-tuned CAR with inducible expression of IL-12 is a promising strategy to develop CAR T cell therapy against TAAs with the potential for reduced on-target off-tumor toxicity and tumor resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/758834ee-5e51-4e35-9ab1-95f1c1de622c\/@x03B8ZS1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Interleukin-12,Ep-CAM,Gastric cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18677"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanping Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huan Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yago Alcaina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaclyn E.

The aim of this study was to overcome these obstacles by introducing an &#945;PDL1\/CD28 switch-receptor construct and by seeking combinatorial strategies for CAR-T cells in solid tumors. We found that in non-transduction T cells, the cytokine release and T cell proliferation were repressed in response to PD-L1 protein, while T cells that express &#945;PDL1\/CD28 switch-receptor showed enhanced functions, indicating that &#945;PDL1\/CD28 could revert PD-L1 inhibition into CD28 costimulation. CAR-T cells with &#945;PDL1\/CD28 switch-receptor showed better effector function than that of unitary CAR-T in vitro studies and significant responses in tumor-bearing mice, with more effector memory T cells infiltrated in the tumor. On this basis, PD-1 inhibitor can further enhance the efficacy and persistence of &#945;PDL1\/CD28 CAR-T cells, especially in PDL1+ tumor models. We found in vitro studies that radiotherapy increased the expression of T-cell recruiting chemokines and promoted CAR-T cell transmigration. In tumor-bearing mice, synergistic anti-tumor efficacy of mice treated with radiotherapy and &#945;PDL1\/CD28 CAR-T cells was further observed. Finally, triple therapy with radiotherapy and anti-PD1 plus &#945;PDL1\/CD28 CAR-T cells maximized antitumor responses and induced complete cures in the tumor-bearing mice. Our study suggests that &#945;PDL1\/CD28 augments the function of CAR-T cells, and the combinatorial regime of &#945;PDL1\/CD28 CAR-T cells, radiotherapy and anti-PD1 in solid tumors could be further investigated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4111a371-e884-4ce1-b80a-3eb7c0529699\/@x03B8ZS1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T cell,Radiotherapy,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18678"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Limei Yin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenbo Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhuoran Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianxin Xue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruizhan Tong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuangsi Liao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laduona Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yue Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feifei Na<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuanwei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youling Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meijuan Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xianming Mo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chong Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>You Lu<\/i><\/presenter>.

ACT modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can redirect T cells to tumor antigens and has shown remarkable clinical efficacy in patients with relapse and refractory leukemia and lymphoma. 90% of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) respond to CD19 CAR T cell therapy (CAR T19), although only 26-35% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) show complete responses (CR). It is unclear why responses are less frequent in CLL compared to ALL. The heavy pre-treatment received by CLL patients likely contributes to lower response rates with CAR T cell therapy, and disease progression is worsened due to profound T cell defects characterized by elevated expression of IRs such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. Fraietta et. al. assessed CLL patient apheresis samples and CART19 products to show that CR was associated with elevated levels of CD27+PD1-CD8+ T memory cells whereas the non-responders (NR) showed an exhausted phenotype with high levels of multiple IRs. We studied 14 patients with advanced, heavily pretreated CLL who received at least one dose of CART19. Patients with CRs exhibited high <i>in vivo<\/i> expansion and persistence of infused CAR T cells, as opposed to NR&#8217;s. Importantly, at peak levels of <i>in vivo<\/i> CAR expansion, NR&#8217;s had elevated levels of CTLA-4 expression which correlated with poor CLL patient responses to CART19 therapy. In summary, these data suggest that eliminating CTLA-4 mediated T cell inhibition can be clinically beneficial. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that disruption of CTLA4 would improve CAR T cell efficacy in CLL based on numerous observations. Our data demonstrate that knockout (KO) of CTLA-4 in T cells from healthy donors using CRISPR Cas9 technology leads to maintenance of surface CAR expression and higher tumor clearance in a chronic re-stimulation model using CART19 cells against NALM6 tumor cells. In xenograft models of ALL, KO of CTLA-4 increases the anti-tumor efficacy of CART19 cells. We then performed CTLA4 disruption in T cells banked from CLL patients that did not respond to CAR T cell therapy to determine whether dysfunctional CAR T infusion products can be invigorated by CTLA-4 KO. In both<i> <\/i>chronic<i> <\/i>re-stimulation model and xenograft models of NALM6, CTLA-4 KO CD19 CAR T cells from CLL patients maintained surface CAR expression, exhibited enhanced tumor clearance, and higher survival rates relative to subject-matched unedited CAR T cells. Thus, suggesting that CTLA4 disrupted CAR T cell products may enhance the success rate of CAR T cell therapy for CLL patients. This technology can be feasibly expanded to other tumor indications to increase the overall efficacy of CAR T cells. These IND-enabling studies will support the translation of this therapy to the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63be1b3c-da83-4511-b9a7-f8a061fa60ba\/@x03B8ZS1\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,CTLA-4,CRISPR\/Cas9,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18680"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sangya Agarwal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Aznar M.

We designed CAR targeting the extra domain B (EDB)-containing fibronectin, which is an oncofetal antigen widely expressed in tumor stroma and on the surface of cancer cells. Unlike membrane-spanning antigens, EDB-containing fibronectin is embedded in the extracellular matrix, and is enriched in new vasculatures and stromal tissues of tumor tissues. First, we made a second-generation EDB CAR (2G-EDB CAR) that killed EDB<sup>+<\/sup> cells (U87MG, A549, and HUVEC) and showed tumor suppression in a U87MG xenograft tumor model. However, while in vitro the 2G-EDB CAR T cells were sufficiently cytotoxic, the in vivo inhibition of the tumor growth was moderate. Next we designed an EDB CAR that contained CD3&#949; to create 3&#949;-EDB CAR. We show that the 3&#949;-EDB CAR was incorporated into the T cell receptor (TCR) structure. The 3&#949;-EDB CAR completely displaced the native CD3&#949; in the TCR based on immune precipitation and Western analysis. The 3&#949;-EDB CAR was capable of inducing T cell activation and proliferation in the presence of EDB-fibronectin antigen. Further, the 3&#949;-EDB CAR T cells killed tumor cells containing EDB-fibronectin. In vivo, the 3&#949;-EDB CAR T cells demonstrated improved inhibition when compared to the 2G-EDB CAR T cells. To further enhance the EDB-targeting CAR, we added intracellular domain of CD28 to the 3&#949;-EDB CAR to create 3&#949;28-EDB CAR, and showed the 3&#949;28-EDB CAR was still incorporated into the TCR complex. The 3&#949;28-EDB CAR co-opted TCR complex and provided co-stimulatory signal upon binding of EDB antigens. Upon transduction of the 3&#949;28-EDB CAR into primary T cells, we observed upregulation of T cell activation markers CD25, CD69 and granzyme B in presence of the EDB antigen. We show that 3&#949;28-EDB CAR triggered the phosphorylation of CD3&#950;, suggesting that EDB antigen stimulated co-opted TCR and signaled through the TCR-CD3 complex. T cells transduced with 3&#949;28-EDB CAR demonstrated stronger proliferation when activated by U87MG cells compared to 2G or 3&#949;-EDB CARs. Furthermore, 3&#949;28-EDB CAR T cells inhibited in vivo tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, and most of the treated mice had no evidence of residual tumors.

Despite current treatments, the 5-year survival rate is approximately 65%, highlighting an urgent need for new therapies. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor (LGR5) is a promising antigen target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, which may represent a novel effective treatment for CRC. LGR5 binds R-spondins and functions to enhance Wnt and &#946;-catenin signalling involved in maintenance and proliferation of adult stem cells. Expression of LGR5 has been previously reported on cancer stem cells in CRC, and has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in CRC tumor initiation and metastasis. Flow cytometric analysis of LGR5 cell surface expression on <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>ex vivo<\/i> human CRC tumour cells revealed a subpopulation of LGR5<sup>+<\/sup> cells. Six LGR5-targetting CD3<sup>+<\/sup> CAR-T cell variants were developed, which differed in CAR variable heavy (V<sub>H<\/sub>) and variable light (V<sub>L<\/sub>) chain orientation and hinge length. As preliminary experimentation identified that four of the six CAR-T cell variants displayed robust anti-tumour cytotoxicity <i>in vitro<\/i>, these CAR-T cell variants were tested for <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumour efficacy using a subcutaneous human colorectal tumor xenograft mouse model. Pre-injection phenotyping after freeze-thawing of the CAR-T cells revealed greater than 94% transduction efficiency, low expression of co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 and a high frequency of central memory T cells (CD62L<sup>+ <\/sup>CD45RO<sup>+<\/sup>). Additionally, a high frequency of the CD8<sup>+<\/sup> compartment of these CAR-T cells expressed perforin, CD107a, Granzyme B and TNF&#945;. For each variant, intravenous injection of 20x10<sup>6 <\/sup>LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells induced significant tumor regression and gave 100-day survival post-tumor injection. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> analyses of tumors and spleens via flow cytometry at endpoint indicated CAR-T cell persistence to 100-days post-tumor injection. Of the CAR-T cells isolated from tumours <i>ex vivo<\/i>, high level expression of co-inhibitory receptors PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3 was observed. The splenic T cell population was enriched for central memory T cells and expressed high levels of PD-1. Complete tumor remission was achieved in 100% of mice receiving the V<sub>H<\/sub>-V<sub>L<\/sub> orientation, medium hinge CAR construct (designated CNA3103), prompting further investigation of this variant. Intravenous injection of 5x10<sup>6 <\/sup>CNA3103 CAR-T cells was sufficient to induce tumour remission and 100-day survival. Similarly, complete tumour rejection was achieved with a dose of 2.5x10<sup>6<\/sup> CNA3103 CAR-T cells in a 30-day <i>in vivo <\/i>experiment. These results demonstrate that LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells exhibit potent <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy and position LGR5 as a promising CAR target antigen, prompting investigation of LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells as a therapeutic for CRC in future clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6c8eeb1-ff60-4e50-a077-9b071125935f\/@y03B8ZS2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor activity,CAR T cells,In vivo,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18683"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dylan J.

Cancer stem cells are a small population of cells within a tumor that have the capacity to self-renew, differentiate, and initiate new tumors. Cancer stem cells are known to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and are enriched in residual disease which allows relapse. Targeting cancer stem cells will reduce the tumors&#8217; ability to generate new cells resulting in tumor remission. We have tested a novel CAR-T cell that has the potential to target cancer stem cells. Leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) expression is restricted to stem cell populations in multiple tissues in adults. In addition, LGR5 is a marker of cancer stem cells and LGR5<sup>+<\/sup> cells are implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. We designed six lentiviral CAR-T constructs targeting the extra cellar domain of LGR5 with differing linker lengths and binding domain orientation, and tested gene delivery to purified human CD3 T cells and <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity. All constructs were expressed robustly (&#62;90%), and four of six LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells showed significant antigen-specific cytotoxicity against colorectal cancer cell lines <i>in vitro.<\/i> We confirmed the on-target specificity of the LGR5 targeting CAR-T using a cell line over-expressing the LGR5 protein and antibody competition assays, which blocked cytotoxicity. Using optimized gene delivery and CAR-T manufacturing protocols, we generated pre-clinical scale batches of the four lead constructs to evaluate their potency in a pre-clinical colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model. Post expansion our cell products expressed markers of self-renewing na&#239;ve-like and central memory phenotype and three out of four LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells were able to significantly inhibit the growth of human colorectal tumors. These results suggest a CAR-T targeting LGR5 may provide long-term protection against tumor growth. Our data positions LGR5-targeting CAR-T therapy as a viable therapeutic for human metastatic colorectal cancer types with minimal off-target effects, which we now aim to test in human clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/670275f1-cf8e-4e41-bc44-a06fe94e8b43\/@y03B8ZS2\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,CAR T cells,Colorectal cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18684"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Veronika Bandara<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stuart Mills<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lih Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Batjargal Gundsambuu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvana Napoli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jade Foeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dylan McPeake<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Coombs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison Cowin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudine Bonder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Sadlon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaun McColl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Barry<\/i><\/presenter>.

To date, four anti-CD19 CAR-T and one anti-BCMA CAR-T products have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Many more T cell therapy products are currently being explored, directed towards both liquid and solid tumors as well as for other clinical indications. High-quality and robust <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> assay are essential for the discovery and characterization of lead T cell therapy products. Furthermore, despite demonstrating therapeutically successful, the further development of T cell immunotherapies has been hindered by safety concerns. Selected target antigens might be expressed in healthy tissues or engineered T cells may non-specifically bind to antigens in healthy tissues, potentially resulting in severe side effects. In addition, the random integration of the CAR- or TCR-encoded DNA cassettes in the host cell genome has the potential risk of causing insertional mutagenesis and may contribute to oncogenic transformation of the T cells. The aim of this study was to develop several <i>in vitro<\/i> assays for the assessment of efficacy and safety of T cell therapies using CAR-T cells targeting the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) as a model system. Cytotoxicity co-culture assays were developed using increasing effector:target cells ratios and an impedance-based readout to quantify the viability of HER2-positive and -negative cancer cell lines in real-time, to confirm the activity and selectivity of the HER2-CAR-T cells. Furthermore, co-culture assays were also developed for a variety of primary or iPSC-derived healthy human cells (representing various tissues) to assess potential unwanted effects of the HER2-CAR-T cells against healthy cells. In addition, an oncogenicity assay was developed to quantify the survival and proliferation of the HER2-CAR-T cells in the absence and presence of cytokines by flow cytometry, to determine whether the genomic editing of the T cells affected their cytokine-dependency. In conclusion, Charles River Laboratories developed several <i>in vitro <\/i>assays for the preclinical assessment of T cell therapy efficacy, potency, specificity and safety to aid early-stage lead discovery, optimization and development, and to support Investigational New Drug applications. These assays are only a fraction of the End-to-End solution Charles River Laboratories offers for advancing Cell Therapies into the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/271a7b58-99e0-45c0-86c3-d9444e9d3f28\/@y03B8ZS2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Immunotherapy,Cytotoxic T cell,In vitro,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18685"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sophie Vermond<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benita Quist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabrina De Munnik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monique Hazenoot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madalina Avramescu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rene McLaughlin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gemma Moiset<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marijn Vlaming<\/i><\/presenter>.

Since prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) shows a significant overexpression on prostatic cancer cells, , PSMA can be considered a promising target for prostate cancer imaging and treatment. Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown great clinical outcomes in hematological malignancies, there is still limited efficacy in solid tumors due to the lack of tumor-specific antigens, low T cell infiltration in the tumors, immune suppressive tumor microenvironment, and on-target off-tumor toxicity in healthy tissues. The antigen recognition module of CAR T cells is usually a single-chain variable fragment (scFv). In contrast, the variable domains of heavy-chain antibodies (VHH) are small, stable, single-domain antibody fragments with high affinity and do not require the supramolecular assembly. Severe fatalities recently halted clinical trials of PSMA CAR T cells, so affinity tuning may be required to avoid CAR T targeting normal tissues. Here, we developed VHH-based CAR T cells targeting PSMA, able to co-express human somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) actioning as a PET reporter for tracking CAR T cell distribution, as an immunotherapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Primary human T cells were isolated and transduced with PSMA CAR lentivirus at 24 and 48 hours after activation with anti-CD3\/CD28 Dynabeads. Mouse models of 8505C cell line transduced to overexpress PSMA were utilized to test the efficacy of CAR T cells. Tumor growth was monitored regularly by bioluminescence imaging. PET\/CT imaging was performed to monitor T cell localization and biodistribution using &#185;&#8312;F-NOTA-octreotide radiotracer targeting SSTR2 introduced in CAR T cells.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> By alanine substitution of CDR3 in the VHH, we identified several low affinity candidates. The affinity of the VHH-based PSMA CAR was determined to be 22 nM by a saturation binding assay using monomeric human PSMA protein. PSMA CAR expression in primary human T cells was higher than 90%. Compared to non-treated mice, PSMA targeting CAR T cells led to tumor reduction and improved survival in animal models. Moreover, high levels of T cell infiltration and localization in tumor tissues were found, based on PET\/CT imaging. Considering possible treatment-associated toxicities, which led to 2 patient deaths and the halt of one phase 1 trial of PSMA CAR T cells, we will affinity tune VHH-based CAR to improve the safety profile. Thus, additional studies will be performed to test both activity and safety of affinity variants of PSMA CAR T cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We developed PSMA targeting CAR T cells able to induce potent and specific killing of prostate cancer cells. This strategy demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i> against animal models. Therefore, CAR T cells targeting PSMA may be a promising treatment strategy for patients with prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/292f2558-24e7-4ec5-a865-ddd49c8602a8\/@y03B8ZS2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,CAR T cells,Immunotherapy,PSMA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18686"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juan Gonzalez-Valdivieso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanping Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yogindra Vedvyas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yago Alcaina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moonsoo M.

To address these challenges, AffyImmune has developed technologies to affinity tune and track CAR T cells in patients. The targeting moiety is affinity tuned to preferentially bind to tumor cells overexpressing the target while leaving normal cells with low basal levels untouched, thereby increasing the therapeutic window and allowing for more physiological T cell killing. The CAR T cells are engineered to co-express somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), which allows for the tracking of CAR T cells <i>in vivo<\/i> via PET\/CT scan using FDA-approved DOTATATE.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> AIC100 was generated by affinity tuning the I-domain of LFA-1, the physiological ligand to ICAM-1. Various mutants with 10<sup>6<\/sup>-fold difference in affinity were evaluated for structure activity relationships using targets with varying antigen densities. The AIC100 with micromolar affinity was clearly the most effective in non-clinical animal models. AIC100 is currently being evaluated to assess safety, CAR T expansion, tumor localization, and preliminary activity in patients with advanced thyroid cancer (ATC) in a phase I study (NCT04420754). Our study uses a modified toxicity probability interval design with three dosage groups of 10 &#215; 10<sup>6<\/sup>, 100 &#215; 10<sup>6<\/sup>, and 500 &#215; 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Preclinical studies demonstrated greater <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity and safety with micromolar affinity CAR T cells. A single dose of AIC100 resulted in tumor elimination and significantly improved survival of animals bearing ATC xenografts. AIC100 activity was confirmed in other high ICAM-1 tumor models including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and multiple myeloma. In a Phase I patient given 10 &#215; 10<sup>6 <\/sup>CAR T cells, near synchronous imaging of FDG and DOTATATE revealed preliminary evidence of transient CAR T expansion and tumor reduction at multiple tumor lesions, with the peak of CAR T cell density coinciding with the spike in CAR T cell numbers in blood.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We have developed affinity tuned CAR T cells designed to selectively target ICAM-1 overexpressing tumor cells and to spatiotemporally image CAR T cells. Near-synchronous FDG and DOTATATE scans will enhance patient safety by early detection of off-tumor CAR T activity and validation of tumor response. We anticipate that our &#8220;tune and track&#8221; technology will be widely applicable to developing potent yet safe CAR T cells against hard-to-treat solid cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e266c22-e84a-4811-ad17-c8997338d0b7\/@y03B8ZS2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Thyroid cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18688"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jingmei Hsu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yen-Michael Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koen Van Besien<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas J.

We, and others, have demonstrated that chronic antigenic signaling is the predominant factor that drives TCR tumor-reactive, and CAR T cell exhaustion in the TME. To combat this exhaustion, we have engineered CD19-targeted third generation CAR constructs to express pro-memory transcription factors associated with longevity, polyfunctionality and\/or enhanced responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy. Using an immunocompetent murine model of syngeneic solid tumors expressing truncated human-CD19 (hCD19t), we demonstrate that ectopic expression of pro-memory transcription factors in the 4<sup>th<\/sup> generation transcription factor-CARs (TF-CARs) augments CAR T cell therapeutic efficacy against solid tumors. Amongst CAR T cells recovered from established solid tumors, the 4<sup>th<\/sup> generation TF-CAR T cells retained a memory-precursor effector (MPEC) T cell like phenotype, while the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation CAR T cells largely displayed a terminally exhausted phenotype (T<sub>Ex<\/sub>). Importantly, the inclusion of select pro-memory transcription factors did not compromise CAR T cell proliferation or expression of the effector cytokines IFN-&#947; and TNF&#945; following restimulation. In addition to superior control of primary tumors, the TF-CAR T cells instilled greater long-term protection from tumor relapse in mice, which cleared primary tumors (6\/7) compared to 3rd generation CAR T cells (3\/7). Collectively, these data present incorporation of pro-memory transcription factors as an attractive engineering strategy to intrinsically combat CAR T cell exhaustion in the TME and promote long-term CAR T cell memory and protection from tumor relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea96c5ab-c7ae-4b88-b5ad-62084946fde2\/@y03B8ZS2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Solid tumors,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18689"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Steven J.

However, the toxicities related to high-dose IL-2 that is required to support TIL survival and the exhaustion status of the final TIL product after rapid expansion in culture largely limits the clinical application and long-term efficacy of TIL therapy. Grit Biotechnology designed a genetically engineered TIL product (GT202) to express a membrane-bound cytokine that is critical for T cell activation and effector function, leading to enhanced cytotoxicity as well as persistence in vitro and in vivo. Multiple designs of the transmembrane domain of GT202 were compared and the best design was selected based on stable and efficient expression of GT202 on the membrane of TILs. GT202 demonstrated significantly increased cytotoxicity and cytokine production when cocultured with tumor cells in vitro than conventional TILs and better tumor control ability during a serial killing assay. In the meanwhile, GT202 TILs showed enhanced long-term survival and better preservation of TCR clonality without IL-2 in vitro, as well as persisted longer in multiple tissues without IL-2 over conventional TILs + IL-2 in NGS mice. Notably, GT202 TILs achieved better anti-tumor efficacy with low IL-2 in NSG mice inoculated with HLA-matched tumor cells than conventional TILs, corelated with their better infiltration and proliferation in spleen and tumor. In summary, GT202 demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and persistence as well as decreased IL-2 dependency in vitro and in vivo.

Inhibiting PI3K-AKT led to an increase of the effector CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cell population with higher CD25+ and CD28+ in the CD8+ population, more TCF-1<sup>+<\/sup> and CD39<sup>-<\/sup>CD69<sup>-<\/sup> T cells in both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell population, and downregulated exhaustion markers CD39<sup>+<\/sup> and TIM-3<sup>+<\/sup> in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell population. This inhibition significantly increased cytotoxicity when cocultured with tumor cell lines and patient-derived tumor samples. Moreover, dual knockout of <i>ATK1<\/i> and <i>ATK2 <\/i>promoted TIL proliferation, long-term survival and decreased apoptosis of TIL, which were further confirmed by the RNA-seq results. Thus, inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling represents a promising strategy to generate large numbers of TIL with enhanced stemness, activation and cytotoxicity, and could be used to support adoptive cell therapy to treat solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a54bab5-b4e7-4714-b836-14219bc6cc11\/@y03B8ZS2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Immunotherapy,Signal transduction inhibitors,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18691"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zixiao Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheng Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peipei Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Di Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Cui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingwei Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yarong Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

These CARs induce a strong effector differentiation program in T cells that can limit their persistence and result in T cell dysfunction. This induction of terminal effector differentiation is accompanied by transcriptional and epigenetic changes resulting in induction of effector transcriptional factors, inhibitory receptors, and suppression of memory associated genes. In this study, we examine the effect of modulating the epigenome of human Rv-1928z CAR T cells by disruption of the histone methyl transferase, <i>SUV39H1<\/i>, which has been implicated in regulating memory to effector transition in murine T cells (Pace et al. 2018).<br \/>To assess the impact of <i>SUV39H1<\/i> on human Rv-1928z CAR T cells, we treated immune deficient mice bearing the human ALL cell line, NALM6, with limiting doses of <i>SUV39H1<\/i>-edited T cells. <i>SUV39H1<\/i> editing (<i>SUV39H1<\/i><i><sup>etd<\/sup><\/i>) significantly enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of Rv-1928z CAR T cells relative to non-edited counterparts, with 9\/10 NALM6 bearing mice treated with <i>SUV39H1<\/i><i><sup>etd<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>Rv-1928z surviving over the duration of observation (90 days) as compared to 1\/12 mice treated with WT Rv-1928z. This enhanced tumor control in <i>SUV39H1<\/i><i><sup>etd<\/sup><\/i> Rv-1928z CAR T cells was associated with greater initial CAR T cell proliferation upon tumor encounter and enhanced long-term CAR T cell persistence (&#62; day 50).<br \/>To assess whether the persisting <i>SUV39H1<\/i><i><sup>etd<\/sup><\/i> Rv-1928z CAR T cells can mount an effective effector response upon tumor rechallenge, we modified the stress test model such that post primary tumor clearance (day 17), mice were rechallenged by tumor 5 times over 70 days. <i>SUV39H1<\/i><i><sup>etd<\/sup><\/i> Rv-1928z CAR T cells outperformed WT Rv-1928z CAR T cells in eliminating NALM6 upon rechallenge. Paired genome accessibility (ATACseq) and transcriptional analysis revealed epigenetic changes associated with SUV39H1 loss in Rv-1928z CAR T cells that promote expression of memory associated transcription factors and receptors while reducing expression of inhibitory receptors and transcriptional factors associated with T cell dysfunction. In summary, we find that loss of SUV39H1 in human Rv-1928z CAR T cells enhances their anti-tumor efficacy by bringing about changes in their epigenome that enhance their functional persistence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/67236445-3580-41fc-afd9-c95d524e83cb\/@q03B8ZS3\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,CAR T cells,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18692"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nayan Jain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zeguo Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Koche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yosi Gozlan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Brocks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tali Raveh-Sadka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danny Wells<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anton Dobrin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuzhe Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gertrude Gunset<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michel Sadelain<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the previous meeting (AACR2019), we reported that ERI has immunomodulatory activity and higher dose and frequent treatment of ERI (1.0mg\/kg Q4D&#215;3) shows combination antitumor activity with anti-PD-1. ERI-LF is a liposomal formulation of eribulin and has improved pharmacokinetics profile and improved antitumor activity compared to ERI in human xenograft models. Therefore, we expected that ERI-LF has greater immunomodulatory activity than ERI. In this study, we first compared antitumor activity of ERI-LF plus anti-PD-1 with that of ERI plus anti-PD-1 using a P-glycoprotein-knockout 4T1 (4T1#31) mouse breast cancer subcutaneous model. As a result, combination of 0.3mg\/kg ERI (Q7D&#215;2) with anti-PD-1 did not show significant stronger antitumor activity compared to each monotherapy, although it is an unfavorable condition for ERI that was treated with lower dose (0.3mg\/kg) and longer interval (Q7D&#215;2). In contrast, combination of ERI-LF (Q7D&#215;2) with anti-PD-1 enhanced antitumor activity compared to each monotherapy in the dose range of 0.1-1.0mg\/kg ERI-LF, suggesting ERI-LF has greater immunomodulatory activity than ERI. We next performed flow cytometry analysis for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to reveal the mechanism of immunomodulatory activity of ERI-LF. Profile of TILs in 4T1#31 subcutaneous tumor demonstrated that 0.3mg\/kg ERI-LF significantly increased the population of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells and NK cells, and these changes were superior to that of ERI, demonstrating superior immunomodulatory activity of ERI-LF to ERI. When combined ERI-LF with anti-PD-1, the intratumoral TIL population of activated GzmB+CD8+ T and GzmB+ NK cells were significantly increased, demonstrating the mechanism of combination antitumor activity of ERI-LF with anti-PD-1. We finally verified the contribution of CD8+ T and NK cells to combination antitumor activity of ERI-LF with anti-PD-1 by using depletion antibodies for CD8+ T and NK cells. As a result, we confirmed that both CD8+ T cell singly depletion and NK cell singly depletion attenuated antitumor activity of ERI-LF plus anti-PD-1 combination. Furthermore, CD8+ T cell and NK cell combination depletion further attenuated antitumor activity of ERI-LF plus anti-PD-1 combination compared to each depletion, demonstrating that both CD8+ T and NK cells contribute antitumor activity of ERI-LF plus anti-PD-1 combination therapy. In summary, we demonstrated that ERI-LF has superior immunomodulatory activity than ERI and shows strong combination antitumor activity with anti-PD-1. Currently, Phase 1b\/2 clinical trial of ERI-LF plus nivolumab in patients with selected solid cancer (NCT04078295) is underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a565711e-2cf7-45ae-b3b0-e4d4a2932beb\/@q03B8ZS3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Eribulin,Immunomodulation,Liposomes,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18693"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuki Niwa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keito Adachi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taro Semba<\/i><\/presenter>.

Though, Dex showed better therapeutic outcome in murine models, however, desired outcome was not achieved in clinical trials as it failed to induce robust immunity to modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) binds to its receptor (CSF-1R) and recruits tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME which eventually creates the tumor immunosuppressive. Hence, in this study we used PLX-3397, a small molecule inhibitor of CSF-1R to enhance the antitumor efficacy of Dex. In a syngenic B16-F10murine melanoma model, we found that the combination treatment delayed the tumor growth and improved the survival compare to the mono therapy. In TME, the combination treatment significantly depleted the TAMs and MDSCs and increased the infiltration of lymphocytes (TILs). Additionally, Th1 population were found significantly higher in tumor as well as in spleen with mice received both Dex and PLX3397. In conclusion, PLX-3397 enhanced the in vivo antitumor efficacy of Dex by modulating the immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/affe4a18-7290-41b7-a85c-725b3b17ccef\/@q03B8ZS3\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Dendritic cells,Exosomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18694"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anjali Barnwal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayanta Bhattacharyya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bushra Ateeq<\/i><\/presenter>.

T cell exhaustion is characterised by co-expression of checkpoint inhibitor molecules such as PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3; reduced proliferative capacity; and diminished production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; and treatment with checkpoint inhibitor blockade such as Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) have shown great promise in the treatment of a subset of individuals and tumour types. However, resistance to these approaches is prevalent and there is a need to identify novel targets to provide alternative options for the rescue of T cell exhaustion and cancer treatment for use alone or potentially in combination with checkpoint inhibitor modulation. One such target is IKZF3, a transcription factor that is increased in murine models of T cell exhaustion and reduces IL-2 expression. Previously we presented an <i>in vitro<\/i> human T cell exhaustion assay whereby <i>in vitro<\/i> stimulated T cells phenotypically and functionally recapitulate the exhausted T cells found within the tumour microenvironment and now we demonstrate that exhaustion can be partially rescued by treatment with the IKZF3 small molecule inhibitor, Lenalidomide, alone and in combination with checkpoint inhibitor blockade. The use of small molecule inhibitors offers new avenues for reversing T cell exhaustion in cases of checkpoint inhibitor resistance and this platform delivers a robust assay allowing for assessment of small molecules or checkpoint inhibitors both individually and in combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e41b7946-31b3-4463-bd10-408abd28b9e5\/@q03B8ZS3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,T cell,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18695"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"a94f50d6-e01c-4fcc-82fc-e3baec54c2ea","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a94f50d6-e01c-4fcc-82fc-e3baec54c2ea\/@q03B8ZS3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joanne Hay<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francis Acklam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Darryl Turner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Barbour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Preeti Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Courtney Grant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hayley Gooding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rhoanne McPherson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justyna Rzepecka<\/i><\/presenter>.

In addition, treatment of human PBMCs with 558 increased the IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; cytokine secretions. Moreover, the levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine were not increased upon treatment with 558. Although treatment of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) with 558 resulted in CD40 expression, a reduced expression of CD80 and CD86, costimulatory molecules that are required for T-cell activation, was observed. Interestingly, 558 in combination with ADU-S100 not only increased the CD40 expression but also improved the expression of CD80 (4-fold) and CD86 on BMDCs. Furthermore, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#945; and IL-6 was significantly increased when BMDCs were treated with 558 and ADU-S100 combination compared to the individual treatments. TME constitute M2 polarized macrophages that promote secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and favor tumor progression. Interestingly, 558 and ADU-S100 combination reduced the expression of CD206, a mannose receptor that is highly expressed on M2 macrophages and improved the expression of CD80 (25-fold) and CD86 (6-fold) compared to 558 treatments alone. These results confirmed the polarization of M2 macrophages to immunogenic M1 macrophages. Overall, these studies indicate promising potential of 558 and ADU-S100 combination in reprogramming the TME to aid in effective cancer treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72293259-83db-41ea-b087-cd2257fa289d\/@q03B8ZS3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,TLR 7\/8 ,STING ,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18696"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vishnu Revuri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shubhmita Bhatnagar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Schultz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Larson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David M.

Early clinical trial data show that BCMA-targeting TCEs are highly effective immunotherapies for treating relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Thus, it is important to define combinatorial approaches that increase the efficacy and durability of TCE.<b><\/b> We recently investigated a murine anti-BCMA TCE in the immunocompetent IMiD-sensitive Vk*MYC<sup>hCRBN<\/sup> model of MM. Our data show that anti-BCMA TCE was safe and efficacious in most mice, but failed in those with high-tumor burden, consistent with clinical reports of TCE in leukemia. We tested the combination of anti-BCMA TCE and IMiDs to provide an additive anti-tumor effect and stimulatory cytokines, such as IL-2 in the tumor environment. This combination expanded cytolytic T cells and improved activity even in IMiD-resistant high-tumor burden cases. Yet, survival was only marginally extended due to T cell exhaustion. We hypothesized that blockade of the inhibitory immune checkpoint PD-1 would synergize with TCE and IMiDs to potentiate the response directed by the TCE by reinvigorating exhausted T cells. We evaluated the efficacy of the triple therapy combination in Vk*MYC<sup>hCRBN<\/sup>: the anti-BCMA TCE, pomalidomide, and anti-PD1. Checkpoint blockade alone, or in combination with TCE did not improve tumor control or survival compared to control treatments. The triple combination proved most effective at controlling tumor growth, inducing a complete response after 2 weeks of treatment, and was curative in 40% of the mice. Longitudinal analysis of the immune response showed that the addition of anti-PD1 to TCE-IMiDs rescued T cell expansion at tumor sites and sustained expression of activation markers after repeated doses. Longitudinal analysis of blood and bone marrow (BM) cytokines showed the typical profile associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) during T cell immunotherapy. Of note, we observed IL-2, IFN-&#947;, and GM-CSF production was sustained in the BM tumor environment in the triple combination. We suspect that these cytokines, especially IL-2, are key to sustaining non-exhausted effector T cell proliferation in response to TCE therapy. Expectedly, we observed toxicity with the elevated cytokine release in the triple combination. that we anticipate could be controlled with step-up dosing or CRS mitigation treatment. We conclude that combination of PD1 blockade, IMiDs and TCE provides superior efficacy in the immunocompetent preclinical model of MM, Vk*MYC<sup>hCRBN<\/sup>, while increasing inflammatory pathways that can lead to CRS. Finally, as we found this combination to be curative in some mice, we will investigate whether this combination immunotherapy also enhanced an endogenous anti-tumor immune response leading to protective immunosurveillance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f45e93fa-3b42-488f-b258-7976cdd72f0d\/@q03B8ZS3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Bispecific antibody,Immune checkpoint blockade,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18697"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erin W.

However, the ubiquitously expressed CD47 mediates functional interactions with other ligands as well, and therefore targeting of the primarily myeloid cell-restricted inhibitory immunoreceptor SIRP&#945; may represent a better strategy. Here, we present preclinical results on a novel clinical candidate, BYON4228. BYON4228 is an antibody directed against SIRP&#945; and recognizes both of the common allelic variants of human SIRP&#945; which maximizes its potential clinical application in the broad human population. Notably, in contrast to several other anti-SIRP&#945; antibodies in development, BYON4228 does not recognize the closely related T cell-expressed SIRP&#947; that has been reported to mediate interactions with CD47 as well, which are known to be instrumental in T cell extravasation and activation. BYON4228 binds to the N-terminal part of SIRP&#945; and its epitope overlaps with the CD47-binding site. BYON4228 therefore prevents binding of CD47 to SIRP&#945; and thus blocks inhibitory signaling through the CD47-SIRP&#945; axis. Functional studies show that BYON4228 potentiates both macrophage- and neutrophil-mediated elimination of hematologic and solid cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> in the presence of several different tumor targeting antibodies like trastuzumab, rituximab, daratumumab and cetuximab, illustrating the broad potential clinical benefit and application of BYON4228. Single intravenous infusion of up to 100 mg\/kg BYON4228 to male and female cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated and did not elicit any adverse effects. Collectively, this defines BYON4228 as a pan-allelic anti-SIRP&#945; antibody without T cell SIRP&#947; recognition that promotes the destruction of antibody-opsonized cancer cells.

In cancer, autophagy can contribute to both tumor promotion and tumor suppression, and emerging evidence supports a role in resistance to immunotherapy. We investigated whether inhibition of autophagy with a small molecule inhibitor of the class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase Vps34 could stimulate anti-tumor immune responses and potentiate the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Treatment with the Vps34 inhibitor (Vps34i) inhibited autophagy and was weakly cytotoxic to B16F10, MC38, EMT6 and CT26 mouse syngeneic tumor cell lines. In certain cancers, autophagy has been linked to lysosomal degradation of MHC I proteins, thereby downregulating expression and contributing to immune evasion. Notably, we observed minimal upregulation of MHC I surface expression on a subset of mouse and human cell lines. We further explored whether autophagy inhibition would result in release of any soluble immune stimulatory factors from mouse tumor cell lines. Inhibition of Vps34 markedly increased the secretion of several proinflammatory chemokines, including CCL5 and CXCL10. Increased chemokine secretion was also observed in a panel of human cancer cell lines, including NCI-H2009 lung cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer, confirming that the response is observed in human cancer cell lines derived from different tissue origins. As the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10 are critical to the development of robust anti-tumor immunity, we next tested whether Vps34i treatment could potentiate the anti-tumor efficacy of ICB. We explored the activity of Vps34i as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody in three different syngeneic tumor models, including EMT6, CT26 and MC38. No single agent activity was observed in these models, however, combination of anti-PD-1 and Vps34i significantly inhibited the growth of CT26 tumors compared to control. Anti-tumor efficacy of combination treatment was not significantly different compared to single agents, and no complete tumor regressions were observed. No significant increases in CCL5 and CXCL10 were observed in the serum of combination treated mice, potentially explaining the lack of robust efficacy. Our results suggest that inhibition of autophagy promotes the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from mouse and human cancer cells in vitro. As the autophagy pathway exhibits cross talk with other major cell signaling pathways, the tumor contexture may be a critical determinant of the role of autophagy in anti-tumor immune responses. Future experiments will explore which tumor contexts are sensitive to combination of autophagy inhibition and ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c96ee3d9-345b-4ddf-9e8f-bd4bbfff3655\/@q03B8ZS3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Immune checkpoint blockade,Combination therapy,Chemokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18699"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marie Bernardo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-an Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Graf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jane Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fangxian Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virna Cortez-Retamozo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sukhvinder Sidhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eladio Marquez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donald Jackson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack Pollard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy R.

A single vaccination with STRO-002 or SC209 <i>in vitro<\/i>-treated MC38-hFolRa cells in immunocompetent mice resulted in 60% of animals rejecting a subsequent rechallenge with living MC38-hFolRa cells, while relapse was observed in most control mice. Including an additional booster vaccination further increased the proportion ( 90%) of animals remaining tumor free after rechallenge. These results demonstrate that tumor cells pre-treated with STRO-002 or SC209 undergo potent immunogenic cell damage which can, in turn, mount protective immunity <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>The ability of STRO-002 to induce ICD that elicits an effective and robust anti-tumor immune response may translate into several advantages in the clinic. Induction of ICD is likely to offer a complementary anti-tumor mechanism in combination therapy regimens such as with check point inhibitors or VEGF blockade. We have demonstrated that STRO-002 in combination with avelumab in MC38-hFolR&#945;-bearing mice significantly enhanced efficacy and durable anti-tumor immunity. More recent rechallenge studies reveal that this combination treatment suppresses growth of not only MC38-hFolR&#945; but also MC38 wild-type tumor cells, indicating formation of immunological memory with signs of epitope spreading. Additionally, co-administration of STRO-002 with anti-VEGF therapy demonstrates improved TGI compared to monotherapy (p &#60; 0.0001) in human ovarian OV-90 tumors.<br \/>The potent cytotoxic and immunostimulatory properties of STRO-002 may also contribute to enhancing efficacy in indications with low FolR&#945; expression. Such tumor types include endometrial and NSCLC, in which STRO-002 has displayed potent monotherapy activity in preclinical studies. In a panel of endometrial PDX models, STRO-002 was significantly efficacious in 9\/17 (53%) FolR&#945;-positive tumors, including models with moderate and weak FolR&#945; levels. In a NSCLC PDX model, a single dose of STRO-002 induced tumor regression and suppressed tumor growth for up to three months post-dose. In conclusion, the induction of ICD by STRO-002 has potential to increase anti-tumor activity in cancers with low FolR&#945; expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17acae85-ac76-42f6-b854-24df39afe11a\/@r03B8ZS4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18700"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"030878f2-e16f-4a2c-bb04-9d848f13358a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/030878f2-e16f-4a2c-bb04-9d848f13358a\/@r03B8ZS4\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Cristina L.

We previously reported that KZR-261 and KZR-834, a structural analog, potently blocked the expression of various cancer and immune checkpoint-associated secreted and cell surface Sec61 client proteins. This inhibition profile corresponded to broad anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo across multiple solid and hematologic tumor types. Previously presented data demonstrated additive anti-tumor response with KZR-834 in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody in the MC38 syngeneic mouse colon tumor model. Based on these data, we were interested in further characterizing the immunomodulatory potential of Sec61 inhibitors.<br \/>Following treatment with KZR-834 alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, we examined immune cell subsets in excised MC38 tumors by flow cytometry or RNA-seq. Once weekly administration of KZR-834 delayed tumor growth by 40%, while biweekly treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody delayed tumor growth by 66%. Strikingly, the combination with KZR-834 and anti-PD-1 antibody delayed tumor growth by 127%, and 3 of 10 mice had complete tumor regression on Day 45 (end of study). KZR-834 treatment reduced PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and resulted in 50-80% reduction in the frequency of PD-L1+ tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytic and granulocytic myeloid cells). In addition, the frequency of MHCII+ CD86+ PD-L1- dendritic cells and macrophages were increased with KZR-834 treatment. These changes were not detected with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment alone. PD-1+ CD8 T cells were elevated with single agent KZR-834 but not observed in other treatment groups. The combination treatment with KZR-834 and anti-PD-1 increased the numbers of activated CD69+, CD25+, and CD44+ CD8 T cells\/mm<sup>3<\/sup> of tumor when compared to vehicle treatment. A similar trend was detected in activated CD4 T cells. RNA-seq analysis of tumor tissues identified elevated IFN&#947; and T-bet gene expression with combination treatment further indicating T cell changes. In addition, anti-tumor gene signatures for T cells, NK and M1 cells were induced by KZR-834 and anti-PD-1 combination treatment.<br \/>Taken together, these results suggest that KZR-834, in addition to its potent anti-cancer activity, has the potential to modify PD-L1 expression on antigen presenting cells thereby increasing antigen-experienced T cells within the tumor. Specifically, in the MC38 tumor model, KZR-834 combines with anti-PD-1 antibody to enhance immune responses. These data support further investigation into combining KZR-834 with immune checkpoint inhibitors to potentiate anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/22abc561-c790-46c4-aa73-ad7e0a4f9aa4\/@r03B8ZS4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Small molecule inhibitor,Tumor microenvironment,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18701"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer A.

DNMTi hypomethylation of endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements produces cytosolic aggregation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that activates antiviral interferon (IFN) and inflammasome signaling. Accordingly, DNMTi treatment of NSCLC cell lines (A549, H460) increases expression of 1) multiple ERV transcripts; 2) dsRNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5; 3) downstream <u>m<\/u>itochondrial <u>a<\/u>nti<u>v<\/u>iral <u>s<\/u>ignaling protein (MAVS); 4) MAVS-activated antiviral kinases (TBK1, IKK&#945;\/&#946;) and transcriptional regulators (IRF3\/7, NF&#954;B); and 5) IFN&#946; and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).<br \/>A second mechanism of cellular antiviral signaling is STING (<u>st<\/u>imulator of <u>in<\/u>terferon <u>g<\/u>enes) activation triggered by cytosolic dsDNA. Following DNMTi treatment, we observe mitochondrial dysfunction including impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species generation, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. This dysfunction is associated with increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and accumulation of cytosolic mtDNA, leading to increased STING expression and IFN activation that can be abrogated by siSTING or IKK inhibition. Treatment with PARPi, which activates STING via cytosolic accumulation of damaged nuclear DNA, further enhances DNMTi-induced IFN signaling.<br \/>We previously linked IFN activation to DSBR downregulation in breast and ovarian cancer, and now present TCGA analysis in NSCLC indicating a similar negative correlation, corroborated by reduced DSBR in NSCLC cell lines after IFN&#946; treatment. Computational interrogation indicates multiple DSBR promoters contain IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), including potential negative regulators, that may account for these findings. Notably, we find that precise patterns of immune activation may be <i>TP53 <\/i>dependent: NSCLC cell lines with missense mutations (H23, H441, H1115), as observed in ~30% patients, exhibit increased NF&#954;B inflammasome signaling and decreased IFN activation compared to wildtype (A549, H460). <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation is associated with significantly reduced baseline STING expression, potentially affording a more robust DNMTi treatment response; accordingly, <i>TP53<\/i>-mutant NSCLC cells exhibit significantly greater sensitivity to DNMTi\/PARPi.<br \/>Our new data expands on our published work to further understanding of novel mechanisms of 1) inflammasome induction and 2) mitochondrial dysfunction through which DNMTis activate cellular antiviral signaling and downregulate DSBR to induce PARPi sensitivity in NSCLC. We also identify <i>TP53<\/i> as a possible biomarker for future personalization of DNMTi therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA double-strand break repair genes,DNA methyltransferase,Immune response,Mitochondria,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18702"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachel Abbotts<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lora Stojanovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael J.

Clinical trials have reported the combination of ICB with chemotherapy can improve patient treatment outcome, but the synergy potential of most chemo drugs with ICBs are not systematically evaluated due to the limited insight of drug induced alterations in tumor microenvironment. Here, we reported a novel algorithm termed post-treatment-based synergy prediction for chemotherapy and ICB combination (POSEIDON). POSEIDON integrates one million drug-induced transcriptomic changes of T cell and cancer cells from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) and ICB-induced single cell transcriptomic changes of 500K cells from tumor microenvironments across multiple cancer types. Using the gene expression signatures induced by chemotherapy and immunotherapy, POSEIDON utilized a reversal-orthogonal framework to predict the chemo compound that can potentially overcome ICB resistance and improve treatment beneficial. In an anti-PD1 treated melanoma patient cohort, POSEIDON identified a group of VEGFR inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors, including tivozanib and mocetinostat, showing the highest synergy potential with anti-PD1 therapy to reverse the anti-PD1 resistance through regulating T cell activities. In a triple negative breast cancer patient cohort who received the combination of anti-PDL1 and paclitaxel, POSEIDON also predicted several HDAC inhibitors (e.g., mocetinostat) and thymidylate synthase inhibitors (e.g., trifluridine) to synergize with the combination of anti-PDL1 plus paclitaxel and reverse the combination resistance through activating the immune response in tumor microenvironment. In addition to the synergy through tumor microenvironment, POSEIDON is also capable of predicting the synergy through tumor intrinsic mechanism. POSEIDON identified the genetic inhibition of EZH2 can potentially reverse anti-PD1 resistance via upregulation of tumor antigen presentation and interferon signaling. The synergy between EZH2 inhibitor and anti-PD1 was further validated in vivo by treating the anti-PD1 resistant 4T1.2 mouse model with FDA approved EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat and PD1 antibody. Our data showed that, while tazemetostat or anti-PD1 alone failed to inhibit tumor growth, the combination of tazemetostat and anti-PD1 can significantly reduce the tumor size and increase overall survival. Collectively, our study demonstrated that POSEIDON can provide reliable prediction of chemo-immunotherapy synergism by integrating the post-treatment transcriptomic profiles from patient tumor microenvironment and cell lines. We envision that the systematic identification of chemo-immunotherapy synergism will help cancer patients to cope with immunotherapy resistance in the short future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1a5ea364-db72-4fdf-b1ee-b36b37deeb78\/@r03B8ZS4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Chemotherapy,Synergism,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18703"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yue Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yifei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaofei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zehua Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Da Yang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Approximately half of patients with HNSCC develop recurrent or metastatic disease. Recently, anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade was FDA-approved for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic disease, and although relatively well tolerated, only a minority of patients respond. There is an unmet clinical need for agents that enhance responses to anti-PD-1 therapy without excessive toxicity. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statin drugs, are in wide clinical use for hyperlipidemia and are inexpensive and well tolerated. Statin drugs are associated with superior survival outcomes in retrospective population studies of several cancers, including HNSCC. Moreover, statins may reduce multiple treatment-related toxicities, such as radiation-induced skin fibrosis and cisplatin chemotherapy-induced hearing loss. Emerging data suggest that statins may also enhance some aspects of anti-tumor immunity, but this has not been studied in HNSCC. Further, the pleiotropic effects of different statin drugs are highly variable. We hypothesized that a subset of statin drugs would enhance anti-tumor immunity and delay tumor growth in preclinical models of HNSCC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Two immunocompetent, syngeneic murine models of oral cancer (MOC1 and MOC22) were used. To identify which of the seven FDA-approved statin drugs are capable of antitumor activity and enhancing T-cell induced killing, we used a high-throughput <i>ex vivo<\/i> co-culture assay of murine oral cancer cells and tumor infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes. Tumor-bearing mice were then treated with anti-PD-1 antibody (twice weekly IP) and\/or statin drug (daily by oral gavage) for up to three weeks, and tumor kinetics and survival were tracked.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> When added at or near physiologic drug concentrations, all 7 statins strongly inhibited proliferation of MOC1 and MOC22 cell lines. Moreover, the combination of CD8+ T cells and a subset of statins mediated nearly two-fold tumor cell killing effect versus either treatment used alone. In mice, tumor growth delay did not reach statistical significance with statins or anti-PD-1 alone. However, combination therapy induced a significant tumor growth delay versus control mice (p&#60;0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our results have significant implications for both biologic mechanisms and therapeutic applications of statin drugs in HNSCC.

With over two decades in clinical use, new insights into its mechanisms of action continue to emerge. Rituximab infusion into patients results in elevated levels of TNF&#945; in patient sera. However, our understanding of the mechanism of TNF&#945; production in the context of rituximab and its role in anti-tumor immunity remain limited. In our study, we sought to determine the major producers of TNF&#945; following rituximab treatment and the effect of rituximab-induced TNF&#945; on anti-tumor effector cells.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal donors were cocultured <i>in vitro<\/i> with CD20-expressing Raji cells for 1 to 7 days. The coculture was treated with rituximab or non-specific antibody trastuzumab. Recombinant TNF&#945; or TNF&#945; blocking antibody infliximab were used to test the effect of TNF&#945; in the rituximab- or trastuzumab-treated coculture system. ELISA was used to evaluate TNF&#945; production in culture supernatant. Multicolor flow cytometry was used to evaluate for phenotypic and functional changes with TNF&#945; treatment or blockade in various immune cell populations.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>TNF&#945; was robustly produced by PBMCs when treated with rituximab. This production was mediated by the Fc portion of rituximab antibody, as rituximab Fab elicited very little if any TNF&#945; response from PBMCs. Myeloid dendritic cells (HLA-DR+CD123-CD11c+) were the key producers of TNF&#945; in response to rituximab. In the absence of antibody therapy, recombinant TNF&#945; treatment induced proliferation and survival of two major effector cells in the peripheral blood: monocytes and NK cells as determined by cell count and percent of Ki67+ cells. TNF&#945; blockade using infliximab inhibited monocyte and NK cell proliferation and survival. TNF&#945; blockade also protected Raji cells from rituximab-mediated killing.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Rituximab-induced TNF&#945; production promotes the proliferation and survival of monocytes and NK cells. Myeloid dendritic cells are necessary for TNF&#945; production in this context. These results highlight the complexity of the immune response to rituximab treatment.

However, host-versus-graft immune response against histoincompatible T cells prevents the expansion and persistence of allogeneic CAR T cells and mitigates the efficacy of this approach. A major challenge is that, while HLA deletion can result in adaptive immune evasion, innate reactivity is enhanced. While T cells express CD47, we demonstrate here that CD47 expression above endogenous levels is important for immune evasion. We describe here the engineering of human immune evasive CAR T cells building on our previously described hypoimmune technology (Nat Biotechnol 2019;37(3):252-258 and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2021;118(28):e2022091118). The goal is to achieve improved rates of durable complete remissions by improving allogeneic CD19CAR persistence, since it has been shown that autologous CAR T cells have greater durability over years than allogeneic CAR T cells. Human T cells from healthy donors were obtained by leukapheresis. To generate hypoimmune CD19CAR T cells, gene editing was used to eliminate HLA-I\/II and TCR expression and lentiviral transduction was used to express CD47 and CD19CAR containing a 4-1BB costimulatory domain to generate hypoimmune CD19CAR T cells. Control CD19CAR T cells were unmanipulated, i.e., unedited, except for lentiviral transduction used to express CD19CAR. Hypoimmune CD19CAR T cells persist in allogeneic humanized mice and lack T cell activation measured using bioluminescence imaging and ELISPOT analysis, respectively. In contrast, transplantation of control CD19CAR T cells generated from the same human donor resulted in rejection (ELISPOT mean 59 and 558 spot frequencies for hypoimmune CD19CAR T cells and control CD19CAR T cells, respectively; p&#60;0.0001 unpaired t-test). Innate immune cell assays show that CD47 overexpression protects hypoimmune CD19CAR T cells from NK cell and macrophage killing. A blocking antibody against CD47 made the hypoimmune CD19CAR T cells susceptible to macrophage and NK cell killing, confirming the importance of CD47 overexpression to evade innate immune clearance. Importantly, CD47 seemed to provide protection from all NK cell populations while other tested NK cell inhibitory molecules (such as HLA-E\/G, PD-L1) seemed to prevent NK cell killing of only certain subpopulations rather than primary NK cells in total. Hypoimmune CD19CAR T cells retain their antitumor activity in the Nalm-6 B cell leukemia model <i>in vitro<\/i> and in vivo comparable to control CD19CAR T cells derived from various donors. Thus, hypoimmune edits seem to not impact CD19CAR T cell activity and have the potential to provide universal CAR T cells that are able to persist without immunosuppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive immunotherapy,Immune response,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18707"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaomeng Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathy White<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Corie Gattis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Clarke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Landry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ron Basco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eleonore Tham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Tucker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Bandoro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elaine Chu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chi Young<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karl Manner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priscilla Nho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ben Lam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pascal Beauchesne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Foster<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William E.

In various cancers, it has been reported that cytoplasmic localization of HMGB1 is correlated with poor prognosis. Here, we present a novel small-molecule drug candidate, SB17170, which inhibits immune-suppressive cells in tumor microenvironments by specific binding to HMGB1.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> SB17170 is a pro-drug of active metabolite SB1703 which was identified in cell-based phenotypic screening. SB1703 modulates immune responses by inhibiting the secretion of various cytokines from activated macrophages. HMGB1 was revealed as the target protein of SB1703 using Fluorescence difference In Two-dimensional Gel-Electrophoresis (FITGE). The antitumor activity of SB1703 was analyzed in B16F10 murine syngeneic model.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> SB17170 is orally available drug candidate at the clinical development stage for solid tumors. The active metabolite SB1703, bound to HMGB1, was observed in activated MDSC, but not in immature MDSC, and inhibited the activity and cytokine release of MDSC at the submicromolar range. The antitumor activity of SB17170 was observed in B16F10 murine syngeneic model, but not in immunodeficient NOG model, suggesting that SB17170 requires the adaptive immune system for its antitumor activity. The oral treatment of SB17170 in tumor-bearing mice induced intratumor T cell infiltration, but reduced the number of MDSC from day 3. SB17170 also repressed HMGB1 levels as well as MDSC in the blood. In combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors against PD1, PD-L1, and CTLA4, SB17170 enhanced the antitumor responses.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We presented here orally available small-molecule drug candidate, SB17170, which selectively binds to HMGB1 and represses MDSC in tumor microenvironment. SB17170 showed the antitumor activity in B16F10 murine syngeneic models, but not in immunodeficient background, suggesting that its mechanism of action is based on antitumor immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/08ab6686-34d2-4625-8e68-f2953b58ab3a\/@r03B8ZS4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,MDSC,Immuno-oncology,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18708"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Young Il Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sungoh Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyo Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Jin Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Jin Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Bum Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

Tumor cells exhibit a distinct glycosylation pattern and supplementation of glycans has the potential to promote response and overcome resistance to ICI, thus addressing an urgent clinical need. Using a subcutaneous tumor mouse model, we investigated whether two glycopeptide-based test items reduce tumor burden when orally administered alone or in combination with ICI.<br \/>C57\/BL6 mice were supplemented with 3% GNU-201 (n=10) or 3% GNU-101 (n=10) in the drinking water starting 14 days prior to tumor cell injection (d-14), while control mice (n=10) received normal drinking water. On day 0, all mice were injected subcutaneously with YUMM1.7 melanoma cells in each flank. On days 6, 9 and 12, mice in each group received anti-PD1 antibody or an isotype control. Tumor size was measured every 3rd day. On day 15, the mice were sacrificed to analyze tumor weight and tumor infiltrating immune cells. 16S rDNA sequencing of fecal samples was performed on days -14, 0 and 14.<br \/>GNU-201 and GNU-101 supplementation was well tolerated, no difference in water consumption and no abnormal behavior were detected that would indicate adverse effects of the products. While anti-PD1 on its own had no effect on tumor growth, we observed reduced tumor growth in the GNU-201+anti-PD1, GNU-101 and GNU-101+anti-PD1-treated groups, resulting in a significantly reduced tumor volume in these three groups on day 15.<br \/>Administration of the two test items had a clear effect on anti-tumor T cell responses. In combination with anti-PD1, GNU-201 promoted the overall abundance of T cells, and among those the proportion of CD8+ T cells and IFN&#947; producing CD4+ T cells. Even in absence of anti-PD1, GNU-201 promoted the number of IFN&#947;+ CD8+ T cells, indicating that GNU-201 did not only promote tumor infiltration but also activation of CD8+ T cells, which are known to directly kill tumor cells. Finally, GNU-201+anti-PD1 resulted in significantly increased levels of Perforin and TNF&#945; producing CD8+ T cells. With GNU-101 there was a trend towards elevated numbers of T cells and TNF&#945;+ CD4 T cells. In mice that received GNU-101 with anti-PD1, we observed significantly elevated levels of TNF&#945;+ CD8+ T cells and a trend towards higher numbers of IFN&#947;+ CD8+ T cells.<br \/>GNU-201 and GNU-101 induced a significant modulation of the gut microbiota. In particular, the products promoted the growth of <i>Akkermansia<\/i> spp., a genus previously associated with anti-tumor immunity.<br \/>In conclusion, GNU-201 and GNU-101 are both able to boost an anti-tumor immune response upon PD1 inhibition and GNU-101 shows moderate anti-tumor effects on its own. The response is linked with tumor-infiltration and activation of T cells and seems to be associated with changes in the gut microbiome. This study highlights a potential therapeutic role for glycopeptides in boosting anti-tumor immunity in response to ICI therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40c70b45-7b49-484d-980a-92995c3ec8ae\/@r03B8ZS4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glycosylation,Microbiome,Immune checkpoint,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18709"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marianne R.

These myeloid cells shield cancer cells from the sentinel immune response and create a niche for tumor growth. Repolarizing immuno-suppressive myeloid populations in the TME attracted considerable interest from scientific community and several companies, and has produced early positive clinical data. <i><\/i>One of the targets that potently sustains macrophage suppressive phenotypes and is highly expressed on tumor associated macrophages is PSGL-1. Blocking a previously unknown epitope on PSGL-1 triggers macrophage repolarization to a pro inflammatory state. We have determined that our therapeutic candidate VTX-0811, anti-PSGL-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), repolarizes M2-like macrophages to a more M1-like state both phenotypically and functionally as assessed by primary <i>in vitro<\/i> macrophage assays. Transcriptomics profiling of M2c macrophages showed that VTX-0811 upregulated TNF-&#945;\/NF-&#954;B and chemokine-mediated signaling, while downregulating oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and Myc signaling pathways, consistent with a broad M2-to-M1 shift. Furthermore, repolarized macrophages enhanced inflammatory responses in complex primary multi-cellular assays.VTX-0811 also showed efficacy in a humanized mouse PDX model of melanoma. VTX-0811 suppressed tumor growth to a significantly greater degree compared with an anti-PD-1 mAb. At the cellular and molecular levels, the treatment led to an inflammatory microenvironment, including a reduced MDSC population, and increased systemic pro-inflammatory mediators. Compared with anti-PD-1 monotherapy, VTX-0811 alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 increased the fraction of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells among the infiltrating T cells. Significant combination effects of VTX-0811 plus anti-PD-1 were seen within the tumor tissue, spleen, and peripheral blood.Additionally, pre-clinical efficacy of VTX-0811 was demonstrated using <i>ex vivo<\/i> cultures of fresh patient-derived tumors that preserve cellular and molecular composition of the TME. VTX-0811 increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines known to be involved in immune activation of the TME and fresh leukocyte recruitment, as well as linked to clinical response to T cell checkpoint inhibitors.VTX-0811 is a humanized high affinity IgG4\/&#954; mAb that demonstrated safety in NHP primates up to 200mg\/kg dosed weekly for 5 total doses. VTX-0811 does not induce activation of unstimulated PBMC or unstimulated blood-derived neutrophil or T cell cultures. These data provide biological and mechanistic support for advancing this program into the clinic with a first in human trial planned for early 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a132b74d-8a9f-45a6-848e-042423098144\/@s03B8ZS5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,VTX-0811,PSGL-1, SELPLG,macrophage repolarization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18711"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Igor Feldman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatiana Novobrantseva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ani Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Ritter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammad Zafari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Manfra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Low<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steve Sazinsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Brehm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boris Klebanov<\/i><\/presenter>.

Tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells often acquire an altered state of differentiation referred to as &#8220;exhaustion&#8221; and, as a result, they fail to control tumor outgrowth. IL-15 cytokine stimulates the generation, the proliferation and the cytotoxic function of tumor specific CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells and NK cells. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of hetIL-15 immunotherapy after locoregional administration in triple negative breast cancer tumors (TNBC) and to evaluate the metabolic profile of the tumor infiltrating T cells.<br \/><b>Study design and methods: <\/b>We studied the therapeutic efficacy of hetIL-15 immunotherapy in murine EO771 orthotopic breast cancer model. We monitored the effect of the treatment on tumor size and immune infiltration using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. We also evaluated hetIL-15 effects on the cell metabolism and the mitochondrial function of the tumor-infiltrating immune cells, using flow cytometry, Seahorse flux analysis, Mitotracker, 2-NBDG and\/or Bodipy staining.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>hetIL-15 peritumoral administration, as monotherapy resulted in complete regression in 40% of the treated animals and increased survival. We demonstrated that tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T and NK cells were increased in hetIL-15 treated tumors and showed enhanced activation and proliferation, resulting in enhanced intratumoral immunological killing. Metabolic flux analysis of the tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells from treated mice confirmed a rise in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) with substantial increase of spare respiratory capacity, which supports an activated\/non exhausted phenotype of these hetIL-15 treated effector cells. Consistent with the above finding, tumor infiltrated CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells from hetIL-15 treated mice showed increased mitochondrial potential and fatty acid uptake, as evidenced by increased Mitotracker and Bodipy staining, respectively. In addition, tumor infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells from hetIL-15 treated mice presented elevated extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and showed a pronounced shift in the OCR to ECAR ratio in comparison to control, confirming their increased proliferating status.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our results indicate that hetIL-15 not only increases the infiltration and the cytotoxic properties of the CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells inside the tumors, but also enhances the metabolic reprogramming of T cells to achieve superior antitumor efficacy. We suggest that metabolic reprogramming of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells might represent a strategy to promote survival in the metabolically hostile TME as part of an approach to enhance the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/97e0491c-26cd-4852-99bc-7a09b0d4eb8f\/@s03B8ZS5\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,Interleukin-15,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Cytotoxic T cell Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18712"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dimitris Stellas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sevasti Karaliota<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vasiliki Stravokefalou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Breana Myers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara K.

Approaches to curtail the immunosuppressive effects of extracellular adenosine primarily target CD73 and A2aR. In this study, we examined the immunomodulatory effects and antitumor effects of CD73 and A2aR blockade in the context of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. The immunomodulatory effects of anti-CD73 antibody blockade (aCD73) or A2aR inhibition with the small molecule inhibitor AZD4635 were characterized in transgenic mice bearing <i>Pten<\/i>-null prostate tumors after one week of dosing. qPCR-based tumor immune profiling revealed distinct differences between the treatment groups that were characterized by the enrichment of gene signatures related to T cell, natural killer cell, and NK T cell in AZD4635 treated mice and macrophage and B cell in mice treated with aCD73. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significant 2.5- and 4.6-fold increases of granzyme B positive immune cells in the cancer glands of aCD73 and AZD4635 treated mice, respectively. Efficacy studies showed that tumors from mice after long-term treatment with AZD4635 were characterized with high adenosinergic signatures and particularly increased levels of <i>Nt5e, <\/i>the gene encoding CD73. Treatment with aCD73 and AZD4635 alone or in combination led to tumor burden reductions of 4.4%, 15.1% and 16.7%, respectively, after four weeks of treatment and -8.58%, 4.6% and 29.5%, respectively after eight weeks of treatment. Additional analyses showed that androgen deprivation therapy induced an adenosine high signature, and increased <i>Nt5e<\/i> expression levels and CD73-positive infiltrating MDSCs\/neutrophils. The efficacy of AZD4635 versus aCD73 plus AZD4635 was evaluated in an in vivo castration-sensitive model of <i>Pten<\/i>-null prostate cancer treated with apalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy via surgical castration. In this model, mice were treated for eight weeks to allow for the progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and in this setting, the treatment combination of aCD73\/AZD4635 improved tumor burden reduction to 34.3% from 23.1% in AZD4635 treated mice. Moreover 75% (6\/8) of mice treated with aCD73\/AZD4635 had tumor burden reductions greater than 30% relative to vehicle treated controls versus 28.6% (2\/7) of mice in the AZD4635 only group. Our findings show that extracellular adenosine is a key immunosuppressive molecule in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer and provide evidence that implicates adenosinergic signaling via CD73 as a contributing factor to decreased efficacy of A2aR blockade and progression to CRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b70d5e96-148b-4c01-a3a6-ffaf642c4f32\/@s03B8ZS5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Prostate cancer,Adenosine,Immunostimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18713"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marco A.

Moreover, we show how immunostimulatory activity can be regulated via linker design, either by tailoring of IL-15-antibody spacing or by generation of a conditionally active IL-15 format.

Both inflammation and tumorigenesis are influenced by the Tumor necrosis factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) pathway. TLY012 is pegylated recombinant TRAIL protein and is an orphan drug for systemic sclerosis and chronic pancreatitis. The potential synergy between TLY012 and anti-mouse PD-1 antibody was investigated in a syngeneic immunocompetent heterotopic mouse model.<br \/>Methods: KPC-luc PDAC cells were subcutaneously implanted into C57Bl\/6 mice. Treatment combined 10 mg\/kg TLY012 three times per week with 10 mg\/kg anti-mouse PD-1 antibody twice weekly and were compared to individual treatment and control groups. Cytokine profiling via 32-plex Luminex immunoassay was completed after 7 days and after three months of treatment. Flow cytometry at three months evaluated NK and T cell profiles in the spleen and tumors.<br \/>Results: PDAC tumor-bearing mice treated with the combination of anti-mouse PD-1 and TLY012 had slower tumor growth and reduced tumor volume at 70 days compared to either drug alone (all p&#60;0.005). B-cell activating factor, which can be a marker of PDAC tumor progression, was decreased in single and dual treatment groups at three months of treatment. This factor showed the earliest decrease in the dual treatment group, with a cytokine level 44% of that of control mice at 7 days. Long-term dual treatment mice also had the highest levels of proinflammatory cytokines interferon gamma (average 5.6 times control level, p=0.046), CCL5 (average 14.1 times control level, p=0.048), and interleukin-3 (IL-3, average 71.1 times control level, p=0.0053). Flow cytometry showed trends toward decreased circulating regulatory T cells, increased NK cells, and a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells within tumors in the dual treatment group.<br \/>Conclusions: The combination of anti-mouse PD-1 and TLY012 prevents growth of PDAC in an immunocompetent mouse model. The combination also increases tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, decreases circulating Treg cells and alters cytokine expression. CCL5 is a T-cell chemokine, and both interferon gamma and IL-3 are produced by activated T cells and macrophages, and have proinflammatory, antitumor effects. Combining TLY012 and anti-mouse PD-1 creates these changes in immune cell and cytokine levels, suggesting induction of a more proinflammatory immune environment. The proinflammatory state may contribute to decreased tumor growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ebbf18bf-2324-4760-9156-7b4226b0091b\/@s03B8ZS5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immunotherapy,TRAIL,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18716"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna D.

Despite intensive chemotherapy regimen, approximately 60% of patients subsequently relapse. Inflammatory cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) which are part of bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, play a critical role in cancer progression. Current strategies are focused on understanding cell-cell contact dependent\/independent communication within the leukemic stem cell niche. NLRP3 is a part of innate immune mechanisms, resulting in the release of IL-1&#946; and IL-18 immunomodulatory cytokines. Current study was aimed at analyzing NLRP3 pathway regulation at phenotypic and genotypic level in AML BM-MSC compared to healthy BM-MSC and their cross-talk with immune function in AML stem cell niche. MSC were isolated and cultured from AML BM that exhibited heterogenous fibroblastoid shape. Multi-color flow cytometry of AML BM-MSC revealed characteristic high expression of CD90 and minimal expression of CD45. They also expressed immune checkpoint markers TIM3, PDL-1, adenosine receptors A1R\/ A2BR, vimentin and NLRP3. Cultured AML BM MSC and fresh leukemic blasts demonstrated tunneling nanotubules, increased vesicles and increase in mitochondria which were of irregular shapes and sizes as seen by transmission electron microscopy. Microarray data revealed genes of NLRP3 damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) pathway viz. Nlrp3, NME8, Pycard and IL-18 were distinctly upregulated in AML BM-MSC compared to uninvolved BM-MSC. AML peripheral blood (PB) plasma showed immunosuppressive effect on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. NK cell cytotoxicity was found to be significantly reduced in presence of culture supernatant of AML cell line and further reduced with supernatant of cells activated for NLRP3 pathway. Immunofluorescence demonstrated NLRP3 expression in AML BM-MSC and also in vesicles released from MSC. NLRP3 pathway activation was observed in AML cell line which was significantly abrogated upon treatment with NLRP3 inhibitor. NLRP3 pathway is stimulated using basic DAMP agent LPS and secondary activators ATP or Nigericin. Activation was visualized by colocalization of NLRP3 and caspase-1, in the presence\/absence of NLRP3 inhibitor. Expression of IL-1&#946; was observed using immunofluorescence and its release in culture supernatants was measured by ELISA. Inhibition of NLRP3 corroborated with decreased secretion of IL-1&#946; in AML cell line. Thus, a positive correlation of IL-1&#946; release was observed with expression of NLRP3. Paraffin sections of AML BM are being evaluated for NLRP3 pathway markers by immunohistochemistry. Understanding remodelling of BM-MSC, leukemia target and immune cell dynamics through NLRP3 pathway regulation in stroma microenvironment may provide crucial leads in therapeutic modulation of the immune response within the stem cell niche.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49bcbe3f-fb88-41e2-a76f-b5ad2ab883c0\/@s03B8ZS5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Mesenchymal stem cell,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18717"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Monalisa Sahoo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manasi Nagare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naythan Dcunha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meena Patkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manju Sengar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Navin Khattry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anant Gokarn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sachin Punatar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sridhar Epari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanuja Shet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jyoti Kode<\/i><\/presenter>.

Curative treatment relies on surgical resection combined with radiation. In the event of metastasis, chemotherapy is used but generally only with palliative intent. Given the heterogeneity of sarcomas, targeted therapies are limited, which has contributed to the relatively stagnant survival rates seen in the past decades.<br \/><b>Objective:<\/b> Personalized treatments, such as adoptive cell therapy (ACT), may be promising for select sarcoma patients, specifically those with Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS). To better understand ACT&#8217;s feasibility for UPS, we aim to investigate the intersection of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor cells by examining their cytokine output, whose role remains largely unstudied.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tissue samples from untreated sarcoma patients have been collected and viably preserved by our group. The samples were processed for <i>in vitro<\/i> expansion of tumor or TIL cell lines. Tumor cultures were validated with Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to ensure tumor-specific variations were retained. TILs were isolated with tumor fragment (TF) processing and magnetic bead coated anti-CD3\/CD28 Rapid Expansion Protocol (REP). After validating tumor cultures, both tumor and TIL-secreted cytokines were evaluated using Luminex assays.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of the 11 primary UPS samples cultured, 10 generated viable cell cultures as defined by the presentation of stable growth beyond passage 5. A total of 3 cell lines were selected for further validation, and through WES, retained tumor specific variations beyond passage 5. On the other hand, the sarcoma-optimized TF and REP protocols expanded TILs from 7 of 8 UPS cases and yielded up to 6 x 10^7 cells. Although IL-2 is commonly used to facilitate TIL growth, it can also cause activation-induced cell death which is problematic for therapy. We demonstrated that an alternative &#947;-chain interleukin, IL-15, can support UPS TIL growth comparable to IL-2. Unbiased cytokine screening detected anti-tumoral CXCL9\/IFN-&#947; and pro-tumoral IL-10\/ TGF-Beta as highly secreted by TIL cultures while some tumor cultures secreted relatively high concentrations of IL-6 and CCL2.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We developed a robust <i>in vitro<\/i> pipeline to expand sarcoma tumor cultures and TILs for downstream characterization. Functional assays aimed at dissecting the consequences of tumor-mediated IL-6 secretion are underway. These include siRNA-induced knock downs of genes hypothesized to augment the cytokine profile of tumor cells. Future evaluation of TILs will identify their clinical efficacy via flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining. Understanding cytokine secretion from both the tumor and immune components of sarcoma will aid in elucidating interactions within the microenvironment that may be therapeutically relevant.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3564035f-10e0-45fc-860a-821f9b92a926\/@s03B8ZS5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Cytokines,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18718"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Victoria Coward<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacky Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nalan Gokgoz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim Tsoi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay S.

Currently, no effective treatment available for PDA. Immunotherapy that has been shown effective for several cancer types is not successful for PDA treatment overall. The possible reasons of this PDA immunotherapy resistance include lack of neoantigen mutations, low T cell responses and overall immunosuppression state in the tumor microenvironment mediated by myeloid cells and tumor stroma. Recent studies suggest that targeting tumor microenvironment can overcome this immunotherapy resistance and significantly improve the disease outcome. Retinoblastoma (Rb1) protein is a known tumor suppressor protein. In addition, there is accumulating evidence for its role in immune cell response as well, including regulation of apoptosis in myeloid cells. However, the mechanisms of this phenomenon remain not clear. Here we show that targeting Rb1 with a novel molecule AP-3-84 developed in our lab causes apoptosis of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the model of PDA, induces T cell infiltration of the tumor and decreases tumor burden.<br \/>Results: Recently our lab has developed the new small molecule AP-3-84 that is able to bind Rb1 and modulate its activity. Originally, we found that this Rb1 modulator can induce cell death of TAMs and thioglycolate-induced macrophages, but not of the other cell types (neither tumor nor T cells). Gene expression changes upon AP-3-84 treatment showed the induction of oxidative and ER stress programs with a clear activation of p53-dependent genes and caspases. We tested the use of AP-3-84 as immunotherapy against PDA cancer growth using 2 PDA cell lines intrinsically characterized by low T cell and high T cell infiltration (T-low-PDA and T-high-PDA, respectively, originally generated and characterized by J. Li et al., <i>Immunity<\/i> 2018). In accordance with our <i>in vitro<\/i> observation, AP-3-84 was able to reshape immune cell landscape in mice with T-high-PDA by depleting macrophages and inducing T cell infiltration. Importantly, those changes were accompanied by significant reduction of tumor growth. Addition of AP-3-84 to immunotherapy (anti-CD40\/PD1\/CTL4) was also able to decrease tumor burden in T-low-PDA model, which is otherwise resistant to this immunotherapy. Thus, AP-3-84 treatment was able to significantly improve the outcome of experimental PDA by altering immune cell subsets and represent a prospective clinical approach for the clinic.<br \/>Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using unpaired Student t-test with additional false discovery rate adjustment for multiple comparisons for gene expression analysis.<br \/>Conclusions: Modulation of Rb1 in myeloid cells is a novel promising target for PDA treatment. This approach reduces PDA tumor burden by shifting the immune cell landscape towards greater T cell infiltration upon tumor macrophage depletion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9aea0c42-a4ab-4176-ad25-6a4a599c459b\/@s03B8ZS5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,Retinoblastoma protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18719"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Evgenii N.

This makes TGF&#946; a promising immunotherapeutic target in cancer. It is ubiquitously expressed in a latent (L-TGF&#946;) form and the latent form has been shown to promote an immune suppressive phenotype within the tumor microenvironment. Integrin &#945;v&#946;8 specifically binds to L-TGF&#946;. This interaction is essential for the activation of L-TGF&#946;-mediated signals in a variety of immune cell types. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that integrin &#945;v&#946;8-mediated TGF&#946; activation can active directly through L-TGF&#946; and does not require the release of active TGF&#946; (1). Inhibition of integrin &#945;v&#946;8-mediated TGF&#946; activation has been shown to block immunosuppressive regulatory T cell differentiation and enhance the recruitment of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor microenvironment (2). Here, we demonstrate by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) that CRB-601, our selective inhibitor of integrin &#945;v&#946;8 monoclonal antibody candidate, has a high affinity and specificity for the integrin &#945;v&#946;8 complex. Moreover, in comparison to competitor molecules, such as ADWA-11, CRB-601 substantially blocks TGF&#946; activation in a reporter cell assay system. Additionally, using syngeneic mouse models, we evaluated the anti-tumoral properties of CRB-601 as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with immune checkpoints therapies. Findings from this study highlight the importance of integrin &#945;v&#946;8 blockade in mediating the immune landscape within the tumor and leads to an enhanced response to immune checkpoint therapy. In conclusion, CRB-601 is a potent and selective integrin &#945;v&#946;8 blocking monoclonal antibody that enhances the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors <i>in vivo<\/i> and holds promise as a potential combination partner for immunotherapy.

In fact, this kind of therapeutic agent accounts for one fifth of the FDA&#8217;s new drug approvals each year. In addition, their stability and specificity make them the ideal scaffold to develop more complex and efficacious drug modalities such as bispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates. However, in order to advance mAb therapies to the clinic, there are a number of parameters that need to be considered during early-stage development. The purpose of this study was to showcase important preclinical characterization and efficacy experiments aimed at assessing the biological activity, binding profile, mechanism of action and <i>in vivo<\/i> potency of cetuximab, a mAb therapy. Cetuximab targets EGFR, a well characterized receptor present in the epithelial cell membrane that is overexpressed in several cancer types, such as non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. In normal tissues EGFR activation initiates several intracellular signaling events involved in development and homeostasis. However, when overexpressed, it stimulates the growth, metastasis and invasion of tumors. For this reason, EGFR has been considered an important target for the development of new drugs. Here we measured the binding affinity of cetuximab to two EGFR expressing cancer cell lines (A-431 and A-549) and its off-target binding to a broad range of full-length human proteins employing Retrogenix Cell Microarray Technology. Using the AlphaLISA system, we observed that cetuximab significantly inhibits EGF binding to EGFR. The consequences of cetuximab treatment on EGF binding and the initiation of the signaling cascade were investigated by looking at the phosphorylation status of EGFR via intracellular staining and flow cytometry. Moreover, we tested the ability of cetuximab to induce Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) where the target cell lines were co-cultured with freshly isolated NK cells. ADCC was assessed via both flow cytometry and live cell imaging. Lastly, we studied the efficacy of cetuximab <i>in vivo. <\/i>A tumor progression mouse model generated from A-431 cells and several Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) mouse models representing a wide variety of cancers were treated with cetuximab and a significant reduction in tumor growth was observed for most of these cancers. The in vivo efficacy correlated directly with the EGFR expression level determined by IHC. With this case study we have generated a complete and valuable preclinical data package that could be used to advance this mAb therapy into the clinic. Moreover, this study serves as the basis for a streamlined workflow for mAb lead optimization and development as well as comparability studies for biosimilars.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad0a2979-d092-434c-aa5d-07a20526cd42\/@s03B8ZS5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Monoclonal antibodies,Preclinical testing,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18721"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>David Cobeta Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerstin Klingner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Carkill<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Nunan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anya Avrutskaya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paula Miliani de Marval<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amber Blackwell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Dawson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donna Barnes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Freeth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deborah Bruce<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Bazin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>René McLaughlin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Schueler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gemma Moiset<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria L.

VSIG4 is expressed in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) with exquisite specificity. In cancer, increased expression of VSIG4 has been associated with worse survival in multiple indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, and glioma, suggesting an important role in tumor immune evasion. Based upon computational analysis of transcript data across thousands of primary cancer and normal tissue samples, we hypothesized that VSIG4 has an important regulatory role in promoting M2-like immune suppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, and that targeting VSIG4 via a monoclonal antibody could relieve VSIG4-mediated macrophage suppression by repolarizing TAMs to an inflammatory phenotype capable of coordinating an anti-tumor immune response.<br \/>The ability of anti-VSIG4 antibodies to repolarize M2-like macrophages and induce broad immune activation was studied in <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>ex vivo<\/i>, and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. In <i>in vitro<\/i> primary cell assays, anti-VSIG4 upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in M-CSF plus IL-10 driven monocyte-derived M2c macrophages, inducing a shift toward an M1-like phenotype. In a multicellular assay system, blockade of VSIG4 on M2c macrophages co-cultured with autologous T cells in the presence of SEB activation upregulated the expression of both pro-inflammatory myeloid-derived cytokines and T cell-derived cytokines, suggesting that macrophage repolarization <i>in vitro<\/i> can induce T cell activation. To assess these observations in a relevant translational model, fresh, patient-derived tumor samples were treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with anti-VSIG4. Across multiple tumor types, anti-VSIG4 treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of cytokines involved in TAM repolarization and T cell activation, and chemokines involved in immune cell recruitment, at levels generally greater than observed by treatment with anti-PD-1. To determine whether targeting VSIG4 can lead to an anti-tumor effect <i>in vivo<\/i>, syngeneic mouse models were dosed with anti-mouse VSIG4 antibodies. Tumor growth inhibition was observed in syngeneic mouse models dosed with anti-VSIG4 alone and in combination with anti-PD-1. Tumor growth inhibition was partially reversed in studies where CD8+ T cells were depleted, demonstrating that targeting VSIG4 on macrophages can elicit a coordinated attack on tumors in vivo through both innate and adaptive immune responses.<br \/>Taken together, these data suggest that VSIG4 represents a promising new target capable of stimulating an anti-cancer response via multiple key immune mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0b4273cc-e4a2-45d3-ba5c-4469b31f5809\/@t03B8ZS6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,Immune checkpoint blockade,Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18722"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen Sazinsky<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ani Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammad Zafari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boris Klebanov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Ritter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Komoroski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Manfra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Feldman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatiana Novobrantseva<\/i><\/presenter>.

Combination treatment using anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 agents with other immunomodulators brings additional benefits, such as preventing refractory effects towards PD-1\/PD-L1 antibodies, and better inhibitory effects on tumor growth. Biocytogen developed YH008, a tetravalent anti PD-1\/CD40 Fc-silenced IgG1 bispecific antibody (BsAb) that agonizes CD40 in a PD-1-dependent manner. Previously, YH008 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibitory efficacy against B16F10 engrafted tumors in PD-1\/CD40 double humanized mice (established by Biocytogen: B-hPD1\/CD40). Interestingly, in humanized CD40 mice that do not express human PD-1 expression, YH008 did not show tumor inhibition activity against the MC38 engrafted tumor. This observation indicates that YH008 activates the CD40 pathway in a PD-1 dependent manner. When compared with an anti-PD-L1\/CD40 BsAb, YH008 showed superior tumor growth inhibition (TGI) against MC38 engrafted tumors in a triple humanized PD-1\/PD-L1\/CD40 mouse model (B-hPD-1\/hPD-L1\/hCD40). YH008 was observed to promote the proliferation and activation of dendritic cells, as well as increase CD8+\/Treg ratio in B16F10 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Furthermore, YH008 showed a superior liver toxicity profile compared to a selicrelumab analog. At a high dose of 100mg\/kg, YH008 did not elevate liver enzymes in the blood of B-hPD1\/hCD40 mice. Similarly, no significant adverse events were observed in a cynomolgus dose-escalation study.

We are currently investigating a genetically modified oncolytic vaccinia virus as a best-in-class tumor-selective investigational product for the treatment of solid tumors. Specifically, the viral thymidine kinase (TK) has been deleted to enhance safety by greatly limiting replication in healthy tissues while taking advantage of relatively higher endogenous TK levels in tumors. In addition to tumor-selective replication, the oncolytic vaccinia virus encodes an IL-2 variant (IL-2v) protein, which diminishes preferential activation of immunosuppressive T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells while preserving activation of CD8+ and NK cells and avoiding toxicities associated with wild type IL-2. Using a murine surrogate of the oncolytic vaccinia virus, we assessed preclinical efficacy in multiple murine syngeneic tumor models demonstrating selective tumor localized replication resulting in tumor growth inhibition. Consistent with tumor selective virus replication, viral copy number and IL-2v transgene levels were increased and had prolonged expression in the tumors compared to the periphery. Intratumoral colocalization of the virus and IL-2v was confirmed by IHC and ISH, respectively. Tumor growth inhibition was associated with increases in tumor infiltrating CD8 and NK effector cells. Additionally, efficacy of the mouse surrogate virus was associated with systemic increases in circulating total CD8 and NK cells as well as pSTAT5<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 and NK cells in the blood. In summary, we have demonstrated that arming a TK-deficient oncolytic vaccinia virus with an IL-2v transgene can effectively couple short-term destruction of tumor cells through oncolysis with the activation of anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. These data support the study of this therapy in Phase 1 clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed3ec83c-3ae2-4483-bb72-2a92d7193649\/@t03B8ZS6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Oncolytic virus,Vaccinia virus,Interleukin-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18726"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anne-Laure Goenaga<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>I-Ming Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan S.

Myxoma virus (MYXV) is a member of the Pox family of double stranded DNA viruses and infects cancer cell lines of humans and other species. The genome of MYXV is relatively large and is amenable to engineering for expression of transgenic proteins, making it an excellent oncolytic virus for introduction of immunomodulatory proteins. We generated MYXV carrying IL-12 and decorin. IL-12 is an immune modulator that activates T- and NK-cells. Cellular responses to decorin include tumor cell intrinsic signaling effects, tumor matrix modulation, and inhibition of the TGF-beta pathway. We demonstrate the activity of multi-armed MYXV against human and mouse multiple myeloma (MM) cancer cell lines. Efficacy and mechanism of action of multi-armed myxoma virus was also demonstrated in vivo via syngeneic and xenograft models.

Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) is one of the representative cold tumors with immunosuppressive TME and presents obvious correlation between immune check point expression, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and poorer prognosis. In aHCC patients, cancer cells and stellate cells in TME appeared to express high level of PD-L1, which should suppress activities of antitumor immune cells. In this context, the combination of PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors and other therapeutic modalities are tried to treat aHCC. The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a potent way of eradicating cells expressing targetable antigens. Removal of PD-L1 expressing cells in the aHCC TME will improve the clinical outcomes of current therapies against aHCC. In the present study, we developed an autologous anti-PD-L1 CAR T strategy and show high efficacy of tumor suppression using an HCC xenograft model.<br \/><b>[Result] <\/b>We constructed second generation CAR lentiviral vector expressing an unique anti-PD-L1 scFv manifesting moderated affinity. The scFv was specifically generated by phage display technique using human B cell-derived na&#239;ve cDNA library, which targets PD-L1 with intermediate affinity in solid tumor TME. As the secondary signaling motif, CD28 was chosen and tested along with CD3 zeta chain. The effector CAR T, named VPC1, cells specifically recognized PD-L1 expressing HCC cells and exhibited rapid and robust cytotoxic activity in 2D and 3D culture experiments. In an HCC xenograft NSG mouse model, VPC1 CAR T cells significantly suppressed the tumor growth. More importantly, VPC-1-treated animals have well tolerated the CAR T therapy with no significant adverse manifestations during one month observation period and exhibited gradual weight gains since 3 days after CAR T cell injection.<br \/><b>[Conclusion] <\/b>We hereby report that a new autologous PD-L1 CAR-T therapeutic is capable of eradicating solid tumors expressing PD-L1, which would significantly potentiate efficacies of current conventional and immunotherapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2e9e706-85be-4244-9806-ee5f12e8cb4e\/@t03B8ZS6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,PD-L1,Hepatocellular carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19025"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyung-Sik Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hye-Seong Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guk-Yeol Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gi-Chan Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun-Ji Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae-in Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung-Joo Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mihwa Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoonjoo Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Je-Jung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joon Haeng Rhee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bum Chan Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Eun Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, only less than 20% of patients benefit from ICIs including anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (aPD-1). Recently, many studies to improve the response of ICIs are in progress, and especially, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) pathway was emerged as major target. VEGFR inhibitors regulate the differentiation of tumor-associated macrophage, antigen presenting dendritic cell, and T cell infiltration, so they make a synergic antitumor effect with ICIs. In this study, we investigated the effect of lenvatinib combined with anti-mouse PD-1 in syngeneic murine cervical cancer models to show whether VEGFRi enhance the antitumor effect of ICIs. We established syngeneic mouse models of cervical cancer to confirm synergic effect by lenvatinib combined with aPD-1. 1x10<sup>7<\/sup> cells of U14 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of BALB\/c wild- type (immunocompetent) mice and BALB\/c nude (immunocompromised) mice. They were treated with lenvatinib when the tumor volume reached at 200 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, subsequently, aPD-1 was administered in immunocompetent mice. We administrated lenvatinib (10 mg\/kg, orally, daily) and aPD-1(200 &#181;g per mouse, intraperitoneally (I.P), twice a week) for 3 weeks. Tumor volume was measured twice a week. After the end of the experiment, we harvested tumors and spleens, and performed histological analysis. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC) in Asan Institute for Life Science.Although the tumor was increased despite lenvatinib treatment in immunocompromised model with BALB\/c nude mice, on the 17<sup>th<\/sup> day after injection, the tumor growth was inhibited in lenvatinib group compared with vehicle group (2914 mm<sup>3<\/sup> vs. 3663 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, respectively) (P=0.0014). On the other hand, the tumor volume was significantly reduced by lenvatinib in the immunocompetent model (278 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in Len vs. 490 mm<sup>3 <\/sup>in Veh) (P=0.0347), particularly the tumor size was decreased since 2 weeks of injection. Subsequently, we investigated the synergistic effects of combination with lenvatinib and aPD-1 in immunocompetent model. Each single treatment group showed the reduction of tumor volume compared to vehicle group (278 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in Len and 258 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in aPD-1 vs. 490 mm<sup>3 <\/sup>in Veh). Furthermore, the lenvatinib plus aPD-1 combination group reduced tumor volume to 110mm<sup>3<\/sup> on the 24<sup>th<\/sup> day after injection and it was significantly different compared to each single treatment group (P=0.13868 and P=0.27385, respectively).In this study, anti-tumor effect of aPD-1 was enhanced by the regulation of tumor microenvironment with lenvatinib in immunocompetent murine cervical cancer models. In conclusion, addition of lenvatinib is expected to increase the efficacy of ICIs in patients with cervical cancer who have the resistance or insensitivity to ICIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd0dff9a-0a48-4b65-9e08-6277c1c39b27\/@t03B8ZS6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Lenvatinib,PD-1,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19026"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Su-Bin Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Sik Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min-Je Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shin-Wha Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Woo Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong-Man Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

IL-33 was described to activate many immune cell types involved in type-2 immunity and allergic inflammation. Here we describe a novel anti-IL33 humanized monoclonal antibody, SSGJ-621, which bound IL-33 with high affinity and blocked the interaction between IL-33 and ST2. Our study has shown that SSGJ-621 was capable of effectively neutralizing IL-33-induced IL-6 secretion from HUVECs and IL-33-dependent IFN&#947; production in PBMCs and NK cells, suggesting a role that IL-33 might be involved in Th1-type of immunity. In addition, SSGJ-621 also exhibited potent inhibitory effects on IL-33 induced IL-5 and IL-13 production in KU812 cells. In vivo study demonstrated that SSGJ-621 can inhibit the activation of splenocytes in spleen and the production of eosinophils and IL-5 in peripheral blood. Thereby, our results highlight the dual functions of IL-33 in promoting Th1 and Th2 immune responses and SSGJ-621 has potentials to treat not only chronic inflammatory diseases induced by IL-33, but also cancers by favoring Th1 antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,IL-33,Inflammation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19027"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xuesai Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingrou Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cui Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Le Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lujie Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lan Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongli Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenping Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haomin Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, CAR-NK or CAR-T therapy so far has achieved limited efficacy in solid tumors compared with hematologic malignancies. One of the challenges is the lack of prevalent tumor-specific surface antigen target in solid tumors. Hence, we are developing a novel oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV) to deliver a dual functional glycol-immune checkpoint inhibitor and universal tumor cell marker combined with CAR-NK cell therapy to increase anti-tumor efficacy. Using the vaccinia virus deleted in both viral TK and VGF genes (vvDD) to drive the expression of a membrane-bound sialidase derived from <i>actinomyces viscosus <\/i>(<i>av<\/i>Sial) under the viral late promoter, we observed efficient desialylation of both VV-infected and non-infected tumor cells, which would alleviate the suppression of sialic acid on NK and other immune cells within TME. Further, the surface bound avSial on VV-infected tumor cells can also serve as a universal target for <i>av<\/i>Sial-CAR NK cells, with less concern for cross-reactivity to normal human tissues and antigen loss. We developed anti-<i>av<\/i>Sial antibodies through mice immunization study. The selected single chain variable fragments (scFV) were constructed in CAR format containing CD28 CD3 &#950; for co-stimulation and human IL-15 gene for better NK persistence and function. The binding affinity of anti-<i>av<\/i>Sial scFv to <i>av<\/i>Sialidase were further screened in CAR constructs-transfected 293T cells. The selected anti-<i>av<\/i>Sial scFv CAR were packaged into gamma retroviral vectors to transduce activated and expanded NK cells derived from healthy donor peripheral blood. For proof-of-concept, target tumor cell lines A375, A549 and HT-29 expressing transmembrane sialidase and GFP were also generated. Compared with CD19 CAR NK and none transduced (NT) NK cells, <i>av<\/i>Sial CAR NK had markedly increased cytotoxicity against <i>av<\/i>Sial-expressing tumor cells in co-culture assays at low E:T ratios &#60;= 1:2. Upon tumor cell rechallenge, <i>av<\/i>Sial CAR NK also controlled the tumor growth significantly better than CD19 CAR NK or NT NK cells. Furthermore, <i>av<\/i>Sial CAR NK completely eliminated A375 tumor spheroids expressing transmembrane sialidase whereas CD19 CAR NK or NT NK cells only transiently controlled the tumor spheroids growth. Taken together, we have developed an effective <i>av<\/i>Sial targeting CAR IL15 NK that will be used to demonstrate enhanced efficacy and versatility in combination with <i>av<\/i>Sial-armed VV for treatment of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/44244c0c-9013-4ea2-8c42-5508dd0458bf\/@t03B8ZS6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,Oncolytic virus,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19189"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaomei Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guowei Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keshav B.

Dose-limiting toxicities of TCEs include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and on-target, off-tumor toxicities since many solid tumor target antigens are also expressed in healthy tissues, albeit at lower levels. While there have been improvements in the clinical management of immune-mediated toxicities such as CRS, on-target, off-tumor effects remain one of the primary challenges of using TCEs for treatment of solid tumors. Here, we describe TNB-928B, a novel fully human TCE that is bivalent for folate receptor alpha (FR&#945;) that selectively targets FR&#945; overexpressing tumor cells yet avoids targeting cells that express low levels of FR&#945; found in normal human cells. Selectivity is conferred by an avidity effect of the FR&#945; targeting arm in combination with a unique low-affinity CD3 arm and is anticipated to reduce the risk of adverse events in normal cells expressing low levels of FR&#945;. TNB-928B induces preferential effector T cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic activity with minimal cytokine release, compared to a positive control containing OKT3, thereby improving the therapeutic index. Moreover, TNB-928B exhibits substantial <i>ex vivo<\/i> tumor cell lysis using endogenous T cells and is effective <i>in vivo<\/i> promoting T cell infiltration and tumor regression in mouse models of ovarian cancer. Together, these results demonstrate TNB-928B represents a novel next generation immunotherapy modality with enhanced safety and specificity for the treatment of ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6530325-9f5d-474d-b5db-1322af7807ef\/@t03B8ZS6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,T cell engager,Folate receptor,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20553"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian C.

MM is invariably fatal due to frequent disease relapse and\/or treatment refractoriness, and therapies that provide deeper and more durable responses are needed. BiTE&#174; (Bispecific T Cell Engager) molecules are immunotherapy agents that redirect a patient&#8217;s T cells to lyse tumor cells by simultaneously engaging a tumor associated antigen (TAA) on cancer cells and CD3&#949; on T cells. Clinical activity has been observed in MM using BiTE&#174; molecules and other T cell engagers that target B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). BCMA is an attractive MM TAA due to its broad prevalence and restricted normal tissue profile, mainly PCs and plasmablasts. However, heterogenous expression in MM cancer cells, potential antigen loss, and the presence of high levels of soluble BCMA in MM patient sera present challenges that may prevent BCMA-only-targeted therapies from achieving their full potential. To address these issues, we generated a BiTE&#174; molecule capable of engaging BCMA and a second MM TAA, CS1 (also known as SLAMF7). This BiTE&#174; molecule also contains an Fc-based domain to provide half-life extension (HLE). Here, we evaluated the <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> properties of this BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE&#174; molecule. The BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE&#174; molecule had nanomolar binding affinity for human BCMA, CS1, and CD3&#949; and the non-human primate (NHP) orthologues. <i>In vitro<\/i>, we observed picomolar activity against human MM cell lines with a range of BCMA and CS1 expression in a T cell dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) assay using human T cells or NHP peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE&#174; molecule retained TDCC activity in the presence of soluble BCMA up to 2500 ng\/mL as well as against human MM cells engineered to express only BCMA or CS1. <i>In vivo<\/i>, this BiTE&#174; molecule inhibited tumor growth in a MM xenograft model. We also evaluated the BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE&#174; molecule in NHP over 15 days (IV dosing; intra-animal dose escalation from 60&#8594;240 &#956;g\/kg or 180&#8594;540 &#956;g\/kg on days 1 and 8). We observed hallmarks of BiTE&#174; molecule activity in all groups, including transient decreases in circulating lymphocytes and moderate increases in cytokines like MCP-1. We measured the PC-specific transcripts BCMA and J-chain in NHP bone marrow and blood as surrogates for PC levels using ddPCR. These transcripts were reduced in both treatment groups (&#8805;90%) with the strongest effects occurring in the 180&#8594;540 &#956;g\/kg group. Lastly, we showed that CS1 is highly and broadly expressed in MM patient samples and is restricted to a few normal hematopoietic cell types including PCs, NK cells, T cells, and some monocytes. These data suggest that the BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE&#174; molecule has potent <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> activity and may provide therapeutic benefit for MM patients by expanding the population of MM cancer cells that can be eliminated by a BiTE&#174; molecule while overcoming common mechanisms that can impair BCMA-only-targeted MM therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bcf34bbe-f82e-48cf-8693-4cb3177cdcf4\/@u03B8ZS7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,T cell engager,BCMA,CS1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20600"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"3be1a777-5ae2-4cbb-87f2-46e9b41c0ec9","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3be1a777-5ae2-4cbb-87f2-46e9b41c0ec9\/@u03B8ZS7\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Elizabeth T.

However, most patients do not respond to these single-agent approaches. Thus, collaborative strategies that seek to engage novel pathways and cell types may provide therapeutic options for patients wherein pre-existing host and tumor microenvironment factors do not favor current immunotherapeutic agents or in tumors where adaptive resistance has occurred.<br \/>In recent years, the CD226 (DNAX Accessory Molecule-1 [DNAM-1]) axis has emerged as a relevant regulatory node in for natural killer (NK) and T cells - particularly in the context of tumor immunology. Similar to the competitive interplay between CTLA-4\/CD28 and B7 (CD80\/86), inhibitory receptors within the axis (e.g., CD96 [TACTILE]) effectively compete with the co-stimulatory receptor CD226 for binding to shared ligands (e.g., CD155), thereby impairing the initiation and\/or promotion of ongoing antitumor immune responses. Indeed, genetic or monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based co-inhibition of CD96 with other immune checkpoints has proven efficacious in several nonclinical tumor models.<br \/>CD96 has been shown to impact both T cell and NK cell function, offering a level of versatility as a target for cancer immunotherapy. For example, in the setting of anti-PD-1 neoadjuvant treatment, significantly improved survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor-bearing mice was observed following enhancement of NK cell activity by CD96 antibody treatment. Equally, pronounced effects on primary tumor growth following anti-PD-1, -TIGIT, and -CD96 mAb treatment in a colorectal carcinoma tumor model (CT26) was found to be dependent on CD8+ T cells.<br \/>GSK6097608 is a clinical-stage fully-human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)&#954; mAb that targets the inhibitory immune receptor CD96. GSK6097608 was identified, in part, for its ability prevent and disrupt CD96:CD155 interactions, thereby promoting T and NK cell function. GSK6097608 demonstrated concentration-dependent rescue of human immune cell activity following exposure to plate-bound recombinant CD155 (cognate receptor\/ligand); an effect that was improved with concomitant TIGIT blockade. Notably, functional activity was found to be dependent on intact Fc-Fc&#947;R co-engagement, as potentiation of primary human T and NK cell function was lost when GSK6097608 was grafted on an Fc-attenuated backbone. Here, we describe some of the biophysical and functional characteristics that support the rationale for clinical evaluation of GSK6097608.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9160e27e-f3ce-44b7-b9f9-b7996d41b734\/@u03B8ZS7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Drug discovery,Cancer immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21052"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yan Degenhardt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Guan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Morley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Conner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Eastman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Sanderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anand Ravindran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie Krueger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Roth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Smothers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jeremy D.

However, CRT has little effects for metastatic lesions in distant organs and does not prolong the prognosis. Abscopal effect refers to a phenomenon of tumor regression at a distant tumor away from the irradiated primary tumor, presumably through the host immune system. Metformin, a widely used drug for the treatment of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, has been shown to elicit anti-cancer effects partly through the activation of host immunity. However, how metformin modulates the abscopal effects of local radiation (RT) and metformin has not been well investigated. Method; Mice were subcutaneous inoculated by 1x10<sup>6 <\/sup>cells of LuM1, a highly murine lung metastatic subclone of colon 26, at right flank of 7 weeks female BALB\/c mice which were treated with metformin and\/or RT. In RT groups, 4Gy X-ray was selectively given to subcutaneous tumors using lead shield under general anesthesia at day 13 and 15. Metformin hydrochloride (1mg\/ml) were orally administrated from day13 continuously. At 28 days, mice were sacrificed, and we evaluated the weight of primary subcutaneous (s.c) tumor and the number of lung metastases. The phenotypes of splenocytes and blood were examined by flowcytometric analysis. Results: Local RT (4Gy x 2) suppressed the growth of s.c tumor to approximately half of control group although not statistically significantly (p=0.067). Metformin alone did not significantly suppress the tumor growth. However, when combined with RT, tumor weight at day28 was markedly reduced as compared with control group (p&#60;0.01). Many lung metastases developed in all control group mice (Median (M)=120, 22-188) which was not changed by the treatment of metformin alone. The number of metastases tended to be reduced in RT group, although not significant (M=34, 3-78, p=0.12). In comparison, when metformin was combined to RT, the number of lung metastasis was markedly decreased (M=13, 0-70, p&#60;0.01) with no metastases detected in 3 in 10 mice. The ratios of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells tended to be reduced in mice treated with RT alone, while increased in mice treated with RT and Metformin. CD49b(+)CD335(+) activated natural killer (NK) cells was significantly increase in combination group (1.1%&#177;0.19% vs 2.6%&#177;1.0%, p&#60;0.05). The ratios PD-1(+) cells tended to be reduced, whereas those of IFN-&#947; (+) cells in T cell subpopulations after stimulation were significantly increased in mice treated with RT and metformin as compared with those in control group (CD4; 6.8&#177;2.4% vs 10.4%&#177;1.3%, p&#60;0.05; CD8; 24.1&#177;3.6% vs 40.4%&#177;7.2%, p&#60;0.01) Conclusion;Metformin restores T cell exhaustion and increase the number of activated NK cells in irradiated mice which may suppress the growth of lung metastases as abscopal effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ce44e68-8464-46a3-810f-68115f21daa1\/@u03B8ZS7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Radiation therapy,Immune response,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21066"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mineyuki Tojo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideyo Miyato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koji Koinuma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hisanaga Horie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hidenori Tsukui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akira Saito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Kimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Kaneko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideyuki Ohzawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hironori Yamaguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Kawarai Lefor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naohiro Sata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joji Kitayama<\/i><\/presenter>.

However due to the fact that majority of the populations including patients with cancers carry a CD16A-158F allele which has low binding affinity to the Fc fragment of trastuzumab, response to trastuzumab treatment is hindered. Furthermore, overexpression of CD47 on cancer cells prevent macrophages from activation via Fc-Fc&#947;RIIa interaction due to the so called &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal. We therefore designed a bispecific mAb-trap designated as IMM2902. Extensive in vitro as well as in vivo characterization demonstrated that IMM2902 binds to both CD47 and HER2 with high affinity (KD = 5.8x10<sup>-10<\/sup>M for HER2; KD = 8.9x10<sup>-9<\/sup>M for CD47) and has stronger ADCC activity against NCI-N87 (EC50 = 0.054nM for IMM2902, v.s. 0.868nM for trastuzumab). In vivo efficacy studies in several xenograft tumor models revealed a robust anti-tumor activity as reflected by the complete elimination of established tumors in BT-474 breast cancer and NCI-N87 gastric xenograft models even at the dose as low as 3.5mg\/kg. Interestingly, even in Herceptin-resistant breast tumor model, when administered at a dose of 10mg\/kg, the established HCC-1954 tumors were also eliminated. Immunohistochemistry staining of the tumor tissues demonstrated an accelerated HER2 degradation which is highly correlated with tumor volume. IMM2902 has no impact on hemagglutination, nor does it have significant hemotoxicity following single as well as multiple administrations in non-human primate animals at different dosage. Our study suggests that IMM2902 has the potential to be an alternative promising treatment option for patients with her2-positive cancers refractory to trastuzumab treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/178cacdb-db2a-4254-829d-a1751b1b86f2\/@u03B8ZS7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Checkpoint Inhibitors,CD47,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21067"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Wenzhi Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Song Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dianze Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dandan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huiqin Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunmei Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoping Tu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gui Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruliang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Fan Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Various cancers of lung, breast, colon, prostate, ovarian, stomach, pancreas, myeloid and lymphoid tissues are known to highly express CD47 and\/or CD24, which confer cancer cells means of immune-evasion via induction of &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signals. Precisely and simultaneously neutralizing CD47 and CD24 signaling on tumors, when coupled with an IgG1 antibody&#8217;s potent phagocytosis and cytotoxicity activity, may serve as potent immunotherapy for multiple cancer types. We have developed a humanized CD24 neutralizing antibody which has been revealed to neutralize CD24-Siglec-10 interaction and completely eliminate established colon cancer in syngeneic mouse models via proposed mechanisms of antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP), and subsequent tumor-specific immunity as a result of macrophage activation. Using this mAb as backbone, we developed an CD24 mAb-CD47 trap by conjugating the SIRP&#945; decoy receptor to the N-terminal of the antibody heavy chain. Initial in vitro studies indicated that this mAb-trap has simultaneous two-target binding as well as blocking activities. More promisingly, eight administrations of the mAb-trap at 3mg\/kg dose in mice bearing triple-negative breast cancer resulted in a complete tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, in a Herceptin-resistant xenograft tumor model, the mAb-trap is also efficacious and resulted in over 60% of tumor growth inhibition when administrated at 7.2mg\/kg.

However, the multi-step process of exhaustion fixes epigenetic programs that permanently scar T cells, limiting immunotherapeutic efficacy. Rather than reversing T cell exhaustion, we hypothesize that exploiting tumor-specific T cells from protected niches could yield therapies with improved anti-tumor benefit. A subset of TCF1-expressing precursor exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (TPEX) drives the anti-tumor immune response. The tumor draining lymph nodes (dLN) maintain a reservoir of TPEX cells which replenishes intra-tumoral effector T cells. Similarly, the bone marrow (BM) houses long-lived memory T cells with specificity against a broad spectrum of antigens, including tumor-associated antigens. Unlike T cells from the dLN or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), BM T cells can be easily acquired from all patients at any disease stage. We used the B16.OVA-OT-I model to delineate how exhaustion affects tumor-specific T cells within the BM, dLN, spleen (SP), and tumor (TUM) during tumor progression. This model uses adoptively transferred transgenic, OVA-specific OT-I cells as a source of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. High-dimensional immune profiling using spectral flow cytometry enabled us to characterize <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor functionality and the phenotype of OT-I cells derived from different compartments. Interestingly, upon adoptive transfer, OT-I cells resident in the TUM, dLN, BM, and SP or found in circulation were heterogenous in terms of function, persistence, and stemness. These findings suggest that discrete tissues impart location-specific T cell adaptations, and that tissue microenvironment markedly influences the exhaustion profile of tumor-specific T cells. OT-I cells derived from distinct lymphoid organs exhibited differential capacity for cytokine production and response to cognate antigen, especially compared to their TIL counterparts. Importantly, we identified BM- and dLN-derived CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells as less exhausted and more functional than TILs. Moreover, BM resident T cells appear phenotypically more stem-like and similar to TPEX. Further studies to characterize this population are ongoing. This work implies that, in the context of localized disease, the kinetics of T cell exhaustion differ in lymphoid organs as compared to TILs. Leveraging a less-exhausted pool of tumor-specific cells may lead to greater anti-tumor benefit with new approaches to adoptive cell therapy. As the BM is accessible in all patients, understanding where tumor-specific BM T cells fall on the spectrum of exhaustion and memory could justify their use for such applications. Ongoing work aims to transcriptionally characterize tumor specific BM CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and evaluate their role in anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/91dc5bf2-516c-423c-acb8-da5a46439285\/@v03B8ZS8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Bone marrow,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Lymph nodes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21124"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth Maria Zawidzka<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Biavati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan Heimann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ervin Griffin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Borrello<\/i><\/presenter>.

BiTE&#174; (<u>bi<\/u>specific <u>T<\/u> cell <u>e<\/u>ngager) molecules redirect T cells by engaging CD3 and a tumor-associated antigen (TAA). These molecules have shown clinical efficacy but one mechanism of resistance is loss of a single TAA. We hypothesized that a BiTE&#174; molecule targeting &#62;1 TAA could reduce relapse frequency. FLT3 and CD123, were selected for a dual-targeting BiTE&#174; (dBiTE<sup>TM<\/sup>) molecule.A half-life extended (HLE) CD123-FLT3 dBiTE<sup>TM<\/sup> molecule was evaluated <i>in vitro,<\/i> in mouse xenografts, and in non-human primate (NHP) tolerability studies. The molecule had nM affinity for human and NHP FLT3, CD123, and CD3, and pM efficacy in cytotoxicity assays using human T cells or NHP PBMCs. The molecule achieved 100% killing against single-positive (sp) cells (CRISPR-generated isogenic cell lines) at potencies like those of double-positive (dp) cells (7.4 &#177;. 4.1 pM FLT3sp, 7.1 &#177;. 3.8 pM CD123sp and 3.4 &#177;. 1.5 pM dp, n=3). In a mouse xenograft model, the molecule induced significant activity and extended survival &#62; 3 weeks (1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 mg\/kg (p &#8804; 0.001)). In mice with sp tumors, survival benefit could not be calculated due to high survival, demonstrating that both arms of the molecule are active<i>. <\/i>In NHP, the molecule had a half-life of 52 hours (0.3 or 3 &#181;g\/kg). <i>FLT3<\/i> mRNA levels, a marker of FLT3-expressing cells, decreased in blood following dosing<i>. <\/i>Repeat dosing was not tolerated, and cytokine release was observed. Some cytokines were reduced while others increased. CD123 is reportedly expressed on endothelial cells (ECs), with increased expression in inflammatory conditions. An immunohistochemical survey found that CD123 is expressed on human and NHP monocyte\/macrophages and ECs with limited distribution in lymphoid tissues and lamina propria of the gut. We hypothesized that cytokine release following administration may result in increased CD123 expression and in turn, further increased cytokine levels with repeat dosing. CD123 was detected on primary human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). In co-cultures of HUVECs and T cells, a CD123 BiTE&#174; molecule induced expression of CD123 on HUVEC cells at concentrations that elicited redirected lysis (12.5 pM), T cell activation, and cytokine secretion. To better understand BiTE&#174;-induced upregulation of CD123 on ECs, HUVECs were cultured with supernatants (SN) from a TDCC assay or recombinant IL-3, IL-6, TNF&#945;, or IFN&#947;. Assay SN and TNF&#945; induced &#62;2-fold CD123 expression on HUVECs, but not on CD123-negative primary human pulmonary microvascular ECs. These data demonstrate that CD123 expression on ECs was increased upon exposure to a CD123 mono-targeting BiTE&#174; molecule, potentially through BiTE&#174;-induced secretion of TNF&#945;. Additional studies are ongoing.In sum, a CD123-FLT3 HLE dBiTE<sup>TM<\/sup> molecule was active against both dp- and sp-positive target cells <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Careful selection of TAA for dBiTE<sup>TM<\/sup> molecules is necessary to increase efficacy and maintain safety.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc6f7a97-0ee5-404f-8c4d-b51bfef019d3\/@v03B8ZS8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Resistance,FLT3,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21266"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Rebecca Goldstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Karbowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anja Henn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petra Deegen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joachim Wahl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katja Matthes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Dahlhoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Brooke Rock<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabrina Benchaar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandy Alexander<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Friedrich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joan Lane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoting Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Anlahr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markus Muenz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Raum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tara L.

To understand the effects of the TME subtype, we studied two multi-site murine cancer models, an immune-suppressed KPC (Kras<sup>+\/LSL-G12D<\/sup>; Trp53<sup>+\/LSL-R172H<\/sup>; Pdx1-Cre) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MT4) model and a neu deletion HER2<sup>+ <\/sup>(NDL) mammary adenocarcinoma model with a larger na&#239;ve lymphocyte population. After profiling the two models with histology and single-cell sequencing, we designed immunotherapy combinations with Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) thermal ablation that were specific to each TME subtype. To understand the impact of the molecular and cellular differences upon each model, we characterized the treatment effect with transcriptomic analysis and digital cytometry. We found that combining MRgFUS ablation with immunotherapy reduced tumor growth and extended survival by at least 2-fold in the MT4 pancreatic cancer model. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of bulk RNA sequencing data indicated that the combination of ablation with immunotherapy preferentially enriched functional annotations for leukocyte migration in the MT4 model and wound healing and inflammatory cytokines in the NDL model (e.g. for IL6: 1.6 fold increase in MT4 vs 10.3 fold in NDL tumors). We then particularly focused on whether dendritic cell (DC) activation and CD4 T cell populations could be enhanced when ablating pancreatic tumors. By CIBERSORTx digital cytometry, aCD40 + aPD-1 combinations increased the presence of activated DCs in MT4 tumors by 2.4-fold. Activated DCs were also increased by CP4 (aCD40 + aPD-1 + CTLA-4) alone 1.7 fold or in combination with ablation in both treated (2.4 fold) and distant (2.2 fold) lesions. Ablation combined with aPD-1 alone did not significantly impact DCs in the MT4 model. In addition, CD4 lymphocytes increased 5 and 8 fold in treated and distant tumors by ablation combined with CP4 in the MT4 model. Taken together, inflammatory cytokines were preferentially elevated by ablation in a dense epithelial breast cancer as compared with a pancreatic tumor model. Further, the results suggest that aCD40 immunotherapy retains efficacy when combined with thermal ablation in pancreatic tumors. This work can inform clinical translation of ablative and immunotherapy combination protocols.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3d23e983-1cbc-45e8-9eb6-832e2c91d47b\/@v03B8ZS8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,Ultrasound,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21267"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brett Z.

Not only is fibrosis a major hallmark of lung cancer, it is also a risk factor for lung cancer development (mainly non-small cell lung cancer). In fact, patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are very likely to develop lung cancer. However, treatment and outcome of lung cancer patients with IPF is different than those without IPF despite their common genetic, molecular, cellular and immune properties. New therapeutic strategies are needed for improving outcome of patients bearing both diseases. To address this, we proposed that boosting the activation of P2RX7 with a positive modulator (HEI3090) would be a novel strategy to fight lung cancer. P2RX7 is a purinergic receptor activated by high extracellular ATP levels found in inflamed and tumor sites. It has anti-tumor and immunomodulatory properties by its ability to induce cell death and the release of IL-1b and IL-18. We showed previously that HEI3090 inhibits lung tumor growth by triggering an anti-tumor immune response that relies on IL-18. Indeed, HEI3090-release of IL-18 enhanced the cytotoxicity of NK cells and favored a Th1-biased immune response. Given that lung fibrosis is partly driven by inflammation with a dysregulated Th1\/Th2\/Th17 ratios and given the ability of HEI3090 to favor a Th1-biased immune response, we wondered if HEI3090 was able to inhibit fibrosis. To do so, we used the bleomycin mouse model where we show that activation of P2RX7 with HEI3090 inhibits lung fibrosis. HEI3090 targets P2RX7-expressing immune cells, decreases lung inflammation and favors an anti-fibrotic immune signature. Indeed, HEI3090 promotes the production of IFN-g by T cells and decreases pro-fibrotic IL-17A release by Th17 cells. Moreover, production of TGF-b, the key cytokine driving fibrosis, was greatly reduced in immune cells in HEI3090-treated mice. The antifibrotic effect of HEI3090 seems to rely on an increase of IL-18, known to induce the production of IFN-g by T cells. Overall, we show that reshaping lung immune phenotype by activation of P2RX7 is a promising strategy in lung fibrosis. HEI3090&#8217;s effect on cancer-related fibrosis is ongoing on a Kras mouse model. We highlight a new therapeutic strategy for patients with IPF that would ameliorate treatment and outcome of patients with both lung cancer and fibrosis","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/397a9f22-fcb4-4ef6-8d80-b4e4b27e0a33\/@v03B8ZS8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Tumor immunity,Therapeutics,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21353"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Serena Janho dit Hreich<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alina Ghinet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valérie Vouret-Craviari<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, a fraction of tumors eventually recurred, likely due to CSC plasticity or the ability of LGR5-positive CSCs to interconvert into more drug resistant LGR5-negative cancer cells. Through our efforts to identify underlying mechanisms of drug resistance and plasticity and develop therapies to eliminate CRC, we showed that GPR56 expression is increased with loss of LGR5 protein expression. GPR56 is a member of the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family which mediates diverse functions, including cell adhesion and tumorigenesis. GPR56 is also upregulated in CRC and increased expression levels correlate with poor patient survival. We recently showed GPR56 can promote tumor growth and drug resistance of CRC cells through upregulation of multidrug resistance proteins. These findings identify GPR56 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC. Presently, we are focused on the development and characterization of anti-GPR56 ADCs that selectively bind GPR56-high CRC cells to deliver potent cytotoxic drugs and destroy them. We reported the generation of unique anti-GPR56 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and are currently developing and optimizing GPR56-targeted ADCs conjugated with different drugs. Cell-based binding assays show that our anti-GPR56 mAb binds with high affinity and specificity to 293T cells overexpressing recombinant GPR56 or GPR56-high CRC cells, with no detectable binding to GPR56-negative cells. Using cytotoxicity assays, we evaluated the in vitro efficacy of anti-GPR56 ADCs against several CRC lines with different levels of GPR56 expression and showed that the ADC is only effective against CRC cells expressing GPR56. Moreover, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of our anti-GPR56-ADC against CRC cell line and patient-derived tumor xenograft models in vivo and demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor growth. Altogether, these findings suggest that novel GPR56-targeted ADCs may be a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance for the improved treatment of CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/afd1a604-a6a3-4572-8f0d-c1e9d009e1c5\/@v03B8ZS8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Colorectal cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21355"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Liezl E.

Mesothelin (MSLN) is a glycophosphatidylinositol-linked tumor antigen overexpressed in a variety of malignancies, including AML and solid tumors, such as mesothelioma, cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian, pancreatic, lung, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, endometrial and triple-negative breast cancer. Early signs of clinical efficacy with MSLN-targeting agents have validated MSLN as a promising target for therapeutic intervention, but therapies with improved efficacy are still needed. CD3-based T cell engagers are highly potent therapeutic molecules with T cell cytotoxicity activities in the picomolar range. But high CRS risk and T cell exhaustion has been observed for high affinity CD3-based T cell engagers in clinicals, so we used high affinity MSLN and low affinity CD3 to improve efficacy of T cell engager.<br \/><b>Experimental Design:<\/b> We designed SMTE-001, a 78-kDa, tetra-specific, T-cell-activating protein molecule, which binds to two epitopes (membrane proximal and membrane distal) of MSLN, CD3&#949; on T cells, and to serum albumin. Experiments were conducted to assess the potency, activity, and half-life of HPN536 in in vitro assays, rodent models, and in nonhuman primates (NHP). This molecule was tested in a cytotoxicity assay using human PBMCs co-cultured with OVCAR3, Hela and NCI-H292 cells, which express different levels of MSLN. Soluble MSLN and CA125 (ligand of MSLN) was added to determine effects on cytotoxicity. In vivo xenograft mouse studies were conducted using a PBMC model.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Here we report the design and the promising preclinical activity of SMTE-001 molecule in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that the bivalent MSLN T cell engager has increased in vitro potency in T cell activation and tumor cell killing, as compared to a monovalent counterpart on high MSLN expressing cells. We also demonstrate that T cell exhaustion is reduced for the low-affinity CD3, compared to the low-affinity CD3 molecule. Because soluble MSLN and CA125 is shed from cancer cells into cancer patient serum, we also demonstrate that soluble MSLN and CA125 does not interfere with the cytotoxic activity of SMTE-001. Importantly, we demonstrate in vivo that SMTE-001 significantly inhibits tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, while high-affinity CD3 molecule&#8217; efficacy reduces when higher dosing. In cynomolgus monkeys, SMTE-001 shows pharmacokinetics in support of weekly dosing in humans.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Collectively, these data demonstrate strong anti-tumor efficacy by this novel multispecific bivalent T cell engager. These data indicate the therapeutic potential of this molecule to activate T cells and improve the clinical efficacy in AML and MSLN-expressing solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/38cfc9a9-50bd-443c-8efa-e513c3a4b744\/@v03B8ZS8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Mesothelin,Solid tumors,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21409"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Cuiqing Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaohui Shao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangcun Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingying Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huaiyuan Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yadan Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuai Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Zang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenqing Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunlei Xia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianzhong Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ande Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yayuan Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhuoxiao Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Renhong Tang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Therefore, it is urgent and of interest in scrutinizing predictive indicators to enable a precision anti-tumor strategy, predict the therapeutic response, and better comprehend the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapies. To evaluate the vigorous potential of <i>CXCL9\/10\/11<\/i> score as a single, universal, and reliable surrogate to predict the response to anti-PD-1 therapy in different cancer types. The analyses in this study used the cancer genomic data from 31 different solid cancers in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to calculate the <i>CXCL9\/10\/11<\/i> score, <i>CD274<\/i> expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and tumor immune phenotypes (IPs). The difference of <i>CD274<\/i> expression, TMB, and tumor IPs was then compared between <i>CXCL9\/10\/11<\/i> score<sup>Low<\/sup> and score<sup>High<\/sup> groups for each cancer type. Furthermore, this score was examined in two cohorts of patients with different cancer types treated with anti-PD-1 therapy to predict the expression of <i>CD274<\/i>, regression\/progression status, and progression-free survival (PFS) between the score<sup>Low<\/sup> and score<sup>High<\/sup> groups. <i>CD274<\/i> expression, TMB, and most tumor IPs were significantly elevated in <i>CXCL9\/10\/11<\/i> score<sup>High<\/sup> group than in the score<sup>Low<\/sup> group among 12 different TCGA cancer types including breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, melanoma, bladder cancer, and endometrial cancers. In two validation cohorts of 49 patients with lung cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer, and 85 patients with metastatic melanoma treated by anti-PD-1 therapy, respectively, score<sup>High<\/sup> tumors exhibited significantly high expression of <i>CD274<\/i> than score<sup>Low<\/sup> tumors (p = 0.0006 and p = 0.0023, respectively). Significantly more patients in the score<sup>High<\/sup> group achieved post-treatment cancer regression than those patients in the score<sup>Low<\/sup> group (p = 0.0200 and p = 0.0427, respectively). The patients in the score<sup>High<\/sup> group enjoyed a significantly longer PFS than those in the score<sup>Low<\/sup> group (p = 0.0179 and p = 0.0229, respectively). Our findings suggest that <i>CXCL9\/10\/11<\/i> score can serve as a single, universal, and reliable surrogate corresponding to <i>CD274<\/i> expression, TMB, and tumor IPs within one variable among many different cancer types, and exhibits a vigorous and attractive potential to predict the therapeutic response to anti-PD-1 therapy in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/96a53757-54fa-4eaf-8dea-d5657dc03fc8\/@v03B8ZS8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor mutational burden,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21555"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xuhui Bao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liyi Xie<\/i><\/presenter>.

The efficacy of chemotherapy in sarcoma is limited by the pathophysiology of surrounding tumor stroma. Abnormalities in the tumor microenvironment (TME) result in stiffening of the tumor and accumulation of mechanical stresses which in turn cause the extreme deformation and collapse of intratumoral vessels. Strategies to induce TME reprogramming with the aim to restore mechanical properties of the tissue as well as tumor blood vessel functionality involve the use of &#8220;mechanotherapeutics&#8221;. Herein, we exploited the potential of the antihistamine drug and mast cell stabilizer, ketotifen, to induce mechanotherapeutic effects in murine models of soft tissue and bone sarcoma. Mast cells are the first population of immune cells drawn to the tumorigenic nidus where they interact with multiple components of the TME. Yet, their role in tumor stroma remains enigmatic as they either promote or inhibit tumor development depending on the conditions. In agreement with other mechanotherapeutics, we found that ketotifen induces vascular normalization in a dose dependent manner as indicated by the increase in perfusion, higher open lumen fraction and pericyte coverage of the vessels. Moreover, in vivo ultrasound shear wave elastography confirmed the mechanotherapeutic properties of ketotifen in reducing tissue stiffness, while further ex vivo validation indicated that TME reprogramming is mediated by a significant reduction in cancer associated fibroblast and inhibition of collagen synthesis as well as of that of other extracellular matrix components. Furthermore, we found that ketotifen modulates the immune microenvironment to promote immunostimulation. Immune stimulation was mediated by both intratumoral T cell accumulation and higher cytotoxic to regulatory T cell ratio concomitantly with a pronounced reduction in tissue hypoxia and upregulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules on endothelium. As a result of ketotifen-induced TME reprogramming, the addition of ketotifen to doxorubicin-aPDL1 combination treatment exhibited therapeutic superiority as opposed to doxorubicin-aPDL1, offering a durable tumor remission and immunological memory following tumor rechallenge experiments. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ketotifen has a dual role in shaping the TME: i) reducing intratumoral physical forces to improve perfusion and ii) establishing favorable immunogenic conditions. Therefore, incorporating such agents in clinical practice holds great promise in the treatment of refractory, advanced sarcomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a2b84724-2fe5-4e89-a4f5-1f6635e207d9\/@w03B8ZS9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,Doxorubicin,Immunostimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21557"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Myrofora Panagi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fotios Mpekris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chrysovalantis Voutouri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Michael<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anastasia Constantinidou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John D.

Several reasons may underlie this clinical result, particularly because of immunogenically cold nature of the GBM microenvironment, which is characterized by the low level of infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and by an enriched myeloid suppressor cell population. We and other groups hypothesize that oncolytic virus (OVs)-based treatments can overcome this problem. Our preclinical GBM models and an ongoing clinical trial with oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (oHSV-1) at our institution (NCT03152318) demonstrated that OV treatment leads to an increase in the influx of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells into TME. However, it remained unknown whether these T cells are specific to the tumor. Here, we evaluated T-cell responses against newly identified neoantigens from murine syngeneic glioma line in response to the intratumoral OV treatments.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> To evaluate the effect of oHSV-1 treatment on neoantigen-specific responses, we first performed whole-exome and RNA sequencing of murine GBM for the identification of tumor-specific mutations. Putative MHC I antigens were predicted with netMHCpan V4 and immunogenicity of candidates, that were selected based on affinity to MHC I molecules, were checked by IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. With our workflow, 91 H2-Db-restricted and 77 H2-Kb-restricted peptides were identified. From this group, 8 Db- and 9 Kb-restricted peptides were selected based on their highest MHC affinity. We then asked which of these neoantigens would show enhanced presentation upon oHSV infection in vivo. To determine that we first implanted GBM tumors in the brains of syngeneic mice. At Day7 post-tumor implantation, the oHSV-1 (or vehicle control), was in situ stereotactically administered. Seven days later, splenocytes, PBMCs, and TILs were harvested to be screened. TILs from the oHSV-1 treated mice, but not those from the control group reacted to the putative neoantigens, and this activation was similar in magnitude to the response to the immunodominant HSV peptide. We are currently performing immunopeptidome analyses to confirm the binding of these neoepitopes to MHC upon oHSV treatment and in vivo studies to determine how T cells specific to these MHC-I restricted neoepitopes contribute to the anti-tumor effect.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data with the preclinical model of GBM show for the first time that infection with an oHSV-1 does indeed lead to novel TIL activation against tumor neoantigens that were not presented without OV infection.

BTN3A, highly expressed in a variety of human cancer cells, suppresses &#945;&#946; T cell activation by preventing CD45 segregation and immune synapse formation. Human BTN3A has three isoforms with almost identical extracellular domains, but each has unique cytoplasmic tail. BTN3A is highly expressed in a variety of human cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that blocking BTN3A can remove the immunosuppressive effects of cancer cells and therefore enhance the tumor killing effects of immune cells.<br \/><b>Methods: <i><\/i><\/b>The expression of BTN3A on primary human immune cells was examined by flow cytometry. Human BTN3A2-IgG Fc fusion protein was generated in the Drosophila expression system. BALB\/c wild type mice were immunized with the fusion protein and hybridomas were generated. High-affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were screened and purified. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with human BTN3A1, BTN3A2 or BTN3A3 were used to examine if the purified mAbs can recognize each isoform on cell surface. Artificial CHO antigen-presenting cells (APC CHO cells) were transfected with or without hBTN3A2, and then co-cultured with human primary T cells in the presence of mouse IgG isotype or anti-hBTN3A2 mAb. A mixed lymphocyte reaction with different donor dendritic cells and T cells was performed with isotype or anti-hBTN3A mAb. The hBTN3A2 mRNA expression in a variety of tumor cell lines was screened in a gene database, and the protein expression of selected tumor cell lines was examined by flow cytometry with anti-hBTN3A mAb.<br \/><b>Findings: <\/b>Multiple tumor cell lines, originating from hematologic malignancies, carcinomas, or sarcomas, showed high cell surface expression of hBTN3A by flow cytometry. Two clones of high-affinity, anti-hBTN3A mAb were generated and purified. Both are IgG1 isotypes. Anti-hBTN3A mAb bound to BTN3A1, BTN3A2 or BTN3A3 expressed on NIH 3T3 cells. The majority of human immune cells isolated from peripheral blood from healthy donors expressed hBTN3A, including CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells and &#947;&#948; T cells. BTN3A2 expressing APC CHO cells inhibited primary &#945;&#946; T cell activation, and anti-BTN3A mAb restored T cell proliferation as well as stimulated cytotoxic cytokine production in some healthy donors.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>BTN3A is an immunosuppressive receptor that inhibits &#945;&#946; T cell activation. Anti-hBTN3A mAb restores T cell activation, suggesting the potential for BTN3A to be a target for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b820d457-7ceb-4cf0-806a-611d67dd1b37\/@w03B8ZS9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,T cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21679"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yixian Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoxin Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yao Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mou Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Christopher Pulanco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher David Nishimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Galbo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Madsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>R.

Several monoclonal PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have been approved for various cancers. Unlike antibodies, small molecule inhibitors may offer potential advantages in oral dosing, adjustable control of drug exposure, improved tumor penetration and many other aspects. Therefore, small molecule antagonist which can efficiently abolish interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 may render a novel alternative treatment approach with potentially improved clinical benefits. ABSK043, an oral small molecule inhibitor of PD-L1 discovered by us, has entered into clinical Phase I in 2021. Preclinically, ABSK043 has shown significant tumor growth inhibition as a single agent in multiple models. To explore potential synergy of ABSK043 with other therapeutic agents, in vivo combination experiments were conducted.<br \/>In this work, we present in vivo combination results for ABSK043 with several therapeutic agents such as a VEGFR inhibitor axitinib, or carboplatin, a key component of the widely used CRC standard-of care chemotherapy treatment regimen, as well as other immune-oncology agents. These combinations demonstrated strong in vivo synergy in tumor mouse syngeneic models. Taken together, these data for the first time demonstrated combination synergy of a small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor with other agents and pave the road for potential clinical evaluation of combination treatment of ABSK043 with these agents in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7568fd6-e51f-463e-b671-76acaacb6e20\/@w03B8ZS9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Combination studies,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20069"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haiyan Ying<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongxian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenqun Xin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiaqi Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

To further enhance the therapeutic effects of the vaccine, our laboratory has added type-I interferon (IFN&#945;) and 5-Aza-2&#8217;-deoxycitidine (5Aza) to the therapy. Here, we report that the efficacy seen in this combination results in deeper intratumoral penetration of CD8+ cells, enhanced expression of Th1 t-cell related genes, and increased influx of CD11c+ CD8+ T-cells.<br \/>Methods: Beginning on day five post-transplantation of B16F10 melanoma, the vaccine was administered intramuscularly (i.m.) by electroporation. CpG adjuvant was given two days later. 5Aza was given intraperitoneally at 1mg\/kg and IFN&#945; therapy intratumorally as noted. Tumor sizes over time were assessed. For immunohistochemistry (IHC), formalin-fixed tumors were processed, embedded, cut into slides, and stained for CD8 by on-site core facility. Stained slides were analyzed by a pathologist in a blinded fashion. Tumor lysate gene expression levels and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were assessed by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry respectively.<br \/>Results: Previous work has shown that the combination of IFN&#945;, 5Aza, and vaccine led to significantly reduced tumor burden and overall increases in mouse survival dependent upon all three components. We have since discovered by IHC that CD8+ cells are more abundant and penetrate further into the tumor with the combination treatment compared to vaccine or therapeutics alone. The tumor immune genetic profile shows broad increases of expression for<br \/>genes responsible for T-cell activation, efficacy, and trafficking. Of note, the combination therapy doubled the proportion of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment expressing CD11c (p = 0.027), and the proportions of these cells correlated more strongly to tumor size than do the proportions of CD11c- CD8+ T-cells (r<sup>2<\/sup>=0.51; p&#60;0.0001 compared to r<sup>2<\/sup>=0.19; p = 0.02).<br \/>Conclusions: Efficient targeting of antigen to immature dendritic cells with a chemokine-fusion vaccine offers a potential alternative approach to classic and dendritic cell-based vaccines. Combining this approach with IFN&#945; and 5Aza treatments significantly improved vaccine efficacy. This treatment creates a complex intratumoral network that facilitates T-cell trafficking, Th1-associated gene expression, and an increase of CD11c+CD8+ T-cells, which have recently been shown in the literature to have greater anti-tumor activity than CD11c- T-cells. Further analysis of the pathways engaged by our treatment protocol should provide insights into how to more efficiently activate this recently described, highly effective T cell population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3b26edad-67a5-45fc-974f-653689869034\/@w03B8ZS9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Interferons,T cell,Decitabine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20070"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"d1ce8ab4-82f3-4bb1-9c78-1ae2477c207f","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d1ce8ab4-82f3-4bb1-9c78-1ae2477c207f\/@w03B8ZS9\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James T.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a feasible strategy for the treatment of TNBC, its use causes various side effects known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) including pneumonitis, myocarditis, colitis, hepatitis, and nephritis. Considering severe irAEs could lead to ICIs termination and fatal outcomes, studies into immunotherapy that increases anti-tumor efficacy while reducing side effects are needed. We have previously reported that combination therapy of <i>Bifidobacterium longum<\/i> RAPO and anti-PD-1 shows a better efficacy compared with monotherapy in mice with TNBC. In the present study, we further investigated whether this combination therapy with probiotics would affect the risk of irAEs induced by anti-PD-1 therapy against TNBC.<br \/>Methods: BALB\/c mice bearing the 4T1 murine metastatic breast cancer cells were randomly assigned to tumor control, <i>Bifidobacterium longum<\/i> RAPO (RAPO), Anti-PD-1, or Anti-PD-1+RAPO group. Tumor tissues were analyzed by Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array, and functional analysis of microarray data was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA&#174;, QIAGEN). Lung, heart, colon, liver, and kidney tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR to determine expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Colon and liver tissues were also analyzed by a Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively.<br \/>Results: Functional analysis revealed that inflammation in lung and cardiac lesion was predicted to be reduced in Anti-PD-1+RAPO group compared with Anti-PD-1 group. Indeed, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL1&#946;, IL6, and TNF&#945; was significantly decreased, while anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 expression was increased in the lung, liver, and kidney tissues of Anti-PD-1+RAPO group compared with Anti-PD-1 group. Similarly, in the heart tissue, TNF&#945; expression was decreased, whereas IL10 was significantly increased in Anti-PD-1+RAPO group than monotherapy group. In the colon tissue, combination therapy of Anti-PD-1 with RAPO significantly enhanced expression of IL10 and tight junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1 compared with Anti-PD-1 treatment alone. Colonic expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tended to be reduced in combination therapy group than Anti-PD-1 group. Furthermore, Anti-PD-1+RAPO group was associated with lower level of myeloperoxidase, a pro-inflammatory enzyme released by activated neutrophils, in the liver than Anti-PD-1 group.<br \/>Conclusions: Collectively, in addition to the effects on anti-tumor efficacy, combination therapy of anti-PD-1 with <i>B. longum<\/i> RAPO alleviates the risk of irAEs in mice with TNBC. This study provides evidence that <i>B. longum<\/i> RAPO supplementation might be a novel therapeutic approach in cancer immunotherapy.

Identifying these cancer-associated TCRs (caTCRs) could facilitate the early detection of cancers and trace them back to their origins. Due to the complicated processes of T cell immune response, a practical strategy to obtain caTCRs is developing computational methods to identify caTCRs from population and\/or individual TCR repertoires. Several machine learning-based methods have been proposed during the latest years and have promoted a series of interesting findings. However, these methods can be further improved by overcoming two vital weaknesses on the design of machine learning framework. First, to facilitate the computational processes, the existing machine learning frameworks prefer to decompose the original TCR sequences into length-fixed amino acid fragments, but the lengths of cancer-associated motifs vary from 3 to 10 amino acids. Second, the correlations among TCRs in the same repertoire should be considered, which are not supported in the existing machine learning frameworks. Thus, we developed a multi-instance learning framework incorporating a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, named TEtor, to solve the issues above. TEtor improves the predictions of caTCRs in pan-cancer TCR repertoires on two aspects. On one hand, the CNN model is adopted with the alternative convolutional filters and 1-max pooling operations. Such design of CNN model is able to handle the amino acid fragments with different lengths, and thus realizing the identification of cancer-associated motifs with various lengths. On the other hand, the multi-instance learning framework calculates the correlations among TCRs and assigns an adjusted weight for each TCR according to the prediction and training process. When training this machine learning model, to speed up the convergence, we adopted a filtering step, which only retains the top 500 abundant TCR sequences in each repertoire. To validate the performance of TEtor, we conducted a series of experiments on several cohorts of patients encompassing 11 different cancers. Compared to the existing machine learning methods, TEtor achieved better prediction performance on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and areas under the curves (AUCs) on most of the cohorts. For all of the tested cancer types, TEtor obtained an AUC above 0.7 (e.g. thyroid cancer, 0.97; lung cancer, 0.90; gastrointestinal cancer, 0.9). In conclusion, TEtor is a reasonable and practical framework. It improves the caTCR prediction and could further support the accurate detection of early cancers from individual TCR repertoire data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/151eed15-5bbf-4b9f-a1a4-84bb1e2cdd89\/@w03B8ZS9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Immuno-oncology,Deep learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20072"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ying Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyang Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuanping Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jiayin Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Tregs are enriched in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and suppress anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, specific depletion of Tregs in the TME is expected to reduce anti-tumor immune suppression without affecting hemostasis in the periphery. The C-C motif chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8), highly expressed on Tregs from TME but significantly lower expressed on Tregs from peripheral blood, provides an ideal target for preferentially deletion of Tregs within tumors. GB2101 is a novel anti-CCR8 monoclonal antibody generated from hybridoma. The data from in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that GB2101 is a good PCC molecule with great potential for clinical development.<br \/>Methods: GB2101 was generated by immunization of CCR8 gene plus CCR8 over-expressing cells in mice followed by hybridoma technology. The binding of the antibody to CCR8-expressing cells was detected by flow cytometry. CCL1 ligand blocking was assessed by flow cytometry and calcium flux assay. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) function was evaluated by Jurkat-CD16A-NFAT reporter system. In vivo anti-tumor efficacy was assessed in syngeneic model using human CCR8 knock-in mice.<br \/>Results: GB2101 displayed potent binding to cells expressing CCR8. GB2101 efficiently blocked CCL1 binding and CCL1-induced signals in CCR8 expressing cells. ADCC activity against target cells was observed and afucosylated version of GB2101 improved ADCC response. GB2101 significantly inhibited tumor growth in syngeneic model.<br \/>Conclusions: GB2101 is a novel monoclonal antibody specifically binding to CCR8 with high affinity, and efficiently blocked CCL1-CCR8 pathway and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, it is a very promising preclinical candidate that may be used in the treatment of multiple tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd42f48b-4180-4b1d-972c-321751481caa\/@w03B8ZS9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Regulatory T cells,ADCC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20073"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qinglin Du<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yiqi Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xueyan Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenming Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liwen Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuhua Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

The use of these products improves the efficacy of the delivered drug by reducing related side effects and significantly enhances the therapeutic index of the payload. Over the past years, nuclear medicine studies have validated the Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) as a pantumoral antigen, with more than 28 different cancer types successfully imaged in patients. Since FAP is mostly undetectable in healthy organs, it has been considered as an attractive target for both imaging and therapeutic applications. For this reason, here we describe the generation of a novel fully human monoclonal antibody targeting FAP. The antibody was isolated from a synthetic antibody phage display library and its tumor recognition properties were validated by immunofluorescence performed on a commercial tissue microarray as well as on freshly frozen colon cancer biopsies from human patients. An <i>ex vivo <\/i>biodistribution analysis in mice confirmed the ability of anti-FAP in IgG1 format to selectively localize to solid tumors while sparing healthy organs. Furthermore, Pharmacokinetics (PK) studies in <i>Cynomolgus Monkey <\/i>showed no sink effects at early time points and a slow clearance from bloodstream as expected for IgG1 antibodies. Encouraged by these results, an antibody cytokine fusion (mIL12-FAP) based on the novel anti-FAP antibody was generated and characterized <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>, showing activation of the immune system both in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mouse models bearing FAP-positive tumors. mIL12-FAP exhibited strong anticancer activity in mice bearing CT26-FAP colon carcinomas which could be boosted by the combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, leading to durable cancer eradication. The targeted delivery of mIL12 to the tumor microenvironment increased the infiltrate of tumor-specific lymphocytes and Natural Killer (NK) cells as compared to the control group without apparent evidence of toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3e3e2603-0db8-4005-8854-3c1650e6a805\/@w03B8ZS9\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Antibody engineering,Fusion proteins,Interleukin-12,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20074"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lisa Nadal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederik Peissert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdullah Elsayed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Libbra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dario Neri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto De Luca<\/i><\/presenter>.

It has emerged as an exciting new approach for cancer treatment. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have displayed remarkable efficacy in treating malignant cancers, particularly liquid tumors. CAR-T cells have proven to be a new type of &#8217;living&#8217; therapeutic by harnessing the patients' immune system to recognize specific tumor associated antigens and redirect the engineered T cells to more specifically target tumor cells. A large number of research efforts have been put into developing new CAR structures to increase the scope of targeted cancers and anti-tumor efficacy. Evaluating the biofunction of CAR-T cells in vitro often involves a series of labor-intensive co-culture experiments and immunoassays. Reproducibility also remains a challenge during the validation of new CAR-T cells due to donor-to-donor variation and other factors. In this study, we present a panel of luciferase reporter tumor cell lines that can be utilized to examine the function of CAR-T cells. The panel of selected human tumor cell lines naturally express high levels of CAR-T target antigens on cell surface, such as CD19, CD20 and Her2. After introduction of a Lenti-LUC2 luciferase reporter into the parental cell lines, single cell cloning was performed to isolate stable clones with high luciferase expression. To verify the performance of the target Luciferase reporter cell lines, we used commercially available CAR-T cells expressing CD19, CD20, HER2 and empty vector-transduced T cells as controls in co-culture experiments. The cytotoxicity of the CAR-T cells against target tumor cells was measured using both a luciferase assay and the xCELLigence potency assay. Our results demonstrate that the luciferase reporter system is a relatively simple, robust, and highly sensitive means to measure biological processes. The luciferase reporter cell lines provide an advantage in measuring target cell killing without having to use radioactive <sup>51<\/sup>Cr release assay or pre-labeling the cells in CAR-T functional evaluation. In addition, these reporter cell lines were characterized and authenticated using cell morphology, growth kinetics, and STR analysis. The expression stability of both the target antigen and luciferase was verified by comparing the low passage and the high passage reporter cells. In summary, the well-characterized CAR-T target antigen luciferase reporter cell lines from ATCC provide excellent tools for studying CAR-T biofunction and validating new CAR-T agents for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c89f106-49e5-4b2f-a884-19d51f67913a\/@w03B8ZS9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cytotoxicity,Antigen,Reporter cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20075"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>John Foulke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Della Fera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Fang Tian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Although oncolytic virus (OV) therapy has been proposed as a potential approach to treat GBM, the resistance is frequently observed because GBM cells are usually nonpermissive to OV. Here, we describe a dual-step drug screen for identifying chemical enhancers of oncolytic virus in GBM. An inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4\/6 (CDK4\/6) was identified as the top enhancer from 1416 FDA-approved drugs, selectively increasing potency of the two OV strains, including VSV&#916;51 and Zika virus. Mechanistically, CDK4\/6 inhibition promoted the autophagic degradation of MAVS, resulting in impaired antiviral responses and enhanced tumor-selective replication of VSV&#916;51 <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in<\/i> <i>vivo<\/i>. CDK4\/6 inhibition cooperated with VSV&#916;51 to induce severe DNA damage stress, leading to the amplification of oncolysis. In GBM xenograft models, combination treatment of CDK4\/6 inhibitor and VSV&#916;51 significantly inhibited the tumor growth and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Further investigation revealed that CDK4\/6 inhibitor and VSV&#916;51 synergistically induced the immunogenic cell death and boosted the anti-tumor immunity.

Class I HDACs (which includes HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) contribute in epigenetic regulations of T cell tolerance. Under anergic T cell condition, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are involved in the histone deacetylation. However, the role of HDACs in CD8 T cell function and differentiation is not well understood. Therefore, we aimed to understand the effect of HDAC inhibition (HDACi) on CD8 T cells phenotype and functionality by using Entinostat (ENT), a class I HDAC (HDAC1 and 3) inhibitor. We found that ENT induces strong immune-mediated anti-tumor effects in TC-1 and B16 tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistically, ENT modulated the tumor microenvironment through an increased infiltration of CD8 T cells, enhanced CD8 T cell antigen-specificity and CD8 T cell functionality represented by interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) and granzyme B (GrB) secretion. Our <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>data also indicate that ENT enhances central memory phenotype (CD62L<sup>+<\/sup>, CD44<sup>+<\/sup>) of CD8 T cells. We also found that ENT-treated CD8 T cells have distinct metabolic phenotype compared to activated CD8 T cells. Specifically, these cells relied more on amino acid metabolism while, unexpectedly, they had lower fatty acid uptake with enhanced mitochondrial potential (TMRM). Interestingly, ENT-induced central memory CD8 T cells also showed increased mitochondrial potential as well as reliance on amino acid metabolism. Therefore, ENT treatment induced memory cells with a unique phenotype different from the classical memory CD8 T cells with enhanced effector functions and reliance on distinct metabolic pathways. Furthermore, ENT-treated CD8 T cells have higher peaks at H3K27Ac site compared to the control. Since these peaks are mostly associated with genes such as IFN-&#947;, GrB, Pim1, EOMES, and IL-2, the known canonical target genes of NF-&#954;B in CD8 T cells, we further dissected the role of NF-&#954;B in these ENT-mediated effects. First, motif analysis showed that NF-&#954;B binding motif is enriched in differential H3K27Ac sites associated with HDACi. Next, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis showed that although ENT does not increase total NF-&#954;B levels in CD8 T cells, it enhances its binding to the chromatin due to enhanced gene accessibility. This research highlights the significance of epigenetic modulation in enhancing the immune-mediated anti-tumor effects and provide fundamental understanding of the mechanism of action of HDAC inhibition in CD8 T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/193eb9dd-2d85-4147-a7a6-3cd471d22ebd\/@x03B8ZSa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,T cell,Metabolism,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21403"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nour Shobaki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pankaj Gaur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Nadre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivek Verma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Ordentlich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nazli Jafarzadeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wael Traboulsi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikayel Mkrtichyan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seema Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samir N.

The dismal prognosis of these patients, with a median survival of less than 15 months despite maximal therapy makes the need for new therapeutic approaches urgent. Clinical trials employing oncolytic viruses (OVs) have shown encouraging results, however, it appears that for each OV only a small group of patients responds to treatment. As inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity is a hallmark of GBM, we hypothesized that fresh patient-derived GBM cell cultures will reflect this inter-tumoral variability in response and allow identification of potential biomarkers of susceptibility to specific OVs. Furthermore, we established a co-culture system of primary GBM cultures with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to capture the degree of OV-induced oncolysis in conjunction with subsequent immune activation. Using these model systems, we attempt to develop tools which may guide future personalized trials of OV treatment for GBM.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We tested the oncolytic potency of four OVs derived from different viral families (DNX2401, rQnestin34.5 V1, wild type Reovirus, lentogenic NDV-f0-GFP) on a panel of 19 molecularly characterized GBM cultures and calculated the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) for each virus on each cell culture. Quantitative PCR was performed to assess cytokine expression in tumor cells after infection with the 4 different OVs. OV-induced changes in the gene and protein expression of immune associated genes were assessed in co-cultures of GBM cells with PBMCs using Nanostring nCounter System and Elisa.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Screening of the 4 OVs on the panel of patient-derived GBM cell cultures revealed great inter-tumoral variability in oncolysis and cytokine response to the 4 different OVs with some degree of OV specific cytokine response profiles. Correlation analysis of transcriptome data with susceptibility to the four OVs shows that genes involved in distinct pathways are related to specific OV-sensitivity. In particular, cell cycle and immune related biological processes discriminate responders and non-responders. The co-culture of OV-infected glioma cells with PBMCs suggests that infection with different OVs leads to expression of distinct sets of genes and proteins in PBMCs; indicating that each OV mounts a specific immune response.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Heterogeneity in OV sensitivity is demonstrated in primary GBM cultures, in terms of oncolysis, cytokine induction and in virus-specific changes in gene and protein expression in OV-infected tumor cells\/PBMCs co-cultures. These results support the hypothesis that improving the response rates in oncolytic virotherapy for GBM may require a personalized approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,personalized oncolytic virotherapy,Glioblastoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21771"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eftychia Stavrakaki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Kleijn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wouter B.
