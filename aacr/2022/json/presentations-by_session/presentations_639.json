[{"Abstract":"Therapy (radiation) resistance can<i>, inter alia<\/i>, be caused by an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, elevated concentrations of the oncometabolite lactate and an overexpression of anti-apoptotic heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this study we aimed to break radioresistance by targeting the cancer metabolism. We could show, for the first time, that the lactate metabolism and heat shock response are co-regulated in two cancer cell systems (murine B16F10 melanoma cells, human LS174T colorectal adenocarcinoma cells). A CRISPR\/Cas9 induced double knockout of <i>LDHA\/B<\/i> (LDH<sup>&#8722;\/&#8722;<\/sup>) as well as a pharmacological inhibition of LDH by Oxamate or GNE-140 reduces tumor growth, ROS production and synthesis of different HSPs, including Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hsp27. Moreover, the membrane Hsp70 density was significantly reduced on tumor cells after inhibition of the LDH activity as a consequence of a down-regulated lipid metabolism affecting the Hsp70-anchoring, tumor-specific glycosphingolipid Gb3. Our results demonstrate that influencing cancer metabolism increases radiation sensitivity by an impairment of the stress response. Since presently available LDH inhibitors have a low stability and high toxicity <i>in vivo, <\/i>we are currently investigating more potent LDH inhibitors with a beneficial safety profile. In summary, targeting the lactate metabolism provides a promising strategy to improve radiosensitivity by impairing the stress response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e55945e1-c1f4-4853-b74f-0ab86f05b38e\/@v03B8ZV5\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-01 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Radiosensitivity,Stress response,Radioresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17709"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melissa Schwab<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katharina Thunborg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omid Azimzadeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Von Toerne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxim Shevtsov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masa Zdralevic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacques Pouyssegur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathrin Renner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Kreutz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Vaupel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriele Multhoff<\/i><\/presenter>.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the immune effects of radiotherapy on tumor models with distinct sensitivities, including LL2 (mouse Lewis lung cancer) and CT26WT (mouse colon cancer) syngeneic models.<br \/><b>Methods and materials:<\/b> LL2 and CT26WT cell lines were irradiated with different X-ray doses for 24 h in vitro. Cell viability was determined with a CellTiter Glo assay. RNA and protein expression levels of Sting and IFNb1 were determined by real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting. The corresponding tumor models in C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c mice were established in vivo. Tumor growth of each irradiated model was monitored for 28 days post implantation. Mice were euthanized on day 5 from the beginning of irradiation. Expression levels of immune-related factors Sting and IFNb1 in tumor tissues were determined by real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting. PDL1 expression on tumor cell surfaces and PD1 expression on lymphocyte surfaces andon tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells were measured by flow cytometry. CD8a cell infiltration in tumor tissue was examined using immunohistochemistry.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In vivo, LL2 and CT26WT cell lines were irradiated with distinct strategies, comprising 0 Gy, 8 Gy, 20 Gy,30 Gy, and 8Gy &#215; 3. After 24 h irradiation, no significant decrease of cell viability was observed in any group. No obvious expression level changes of Sting protein in LL2 were observed; however, increased expression of IFNb1 was observed with an increase in irradiation dose to 8 Gy &#215; 3 (P&#60;0.05). However, significant decreases of Sting and IFNb1 expression were observed in both the 20Gy single-dose and 8Gy &#215; 3 irradiation groups in the CT26WT cell line. Cell viability in both the LL2 and CT26WT cell lines was significantly decreased in the 8 Gy &#215; 3 group after 72 h irradiation (P&#60;0.05). No anti-tumor activity of 8 Gy&#215; 3 was found in the LL2 syngeneic model; however, there was a marked effect in the CT26WT model in vivo. In the LL2 model, after 5 days&#8217; irradiation, there was a significant increase in the infiltration of DCs, Th, and Teff cells, and in the expression of PD1 and PDL1 in tumor tissue (P&#60;0.05); however, these effects were not observed in the CT26WT model. Immune responses in tumor tissue were distinct in the two syngeneic mouse models with different radiosensitivities.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In the LL2 model, which was not sensitive to radiotherapy, the immune-responsive effect was enhanced after X-ray treatment in the tumor microenvironment; however, no such effect was found in the radiotherapy-sensitive CT26WT tumor model. Our data demonstrate that radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy can greatly improve anti-tumor activity in LL2 radiotherapy-insensitive tumor models. These results also provide a possible basis for effective treatment in other radiotherapy-insensitive tumor models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3e1e0d36-46bb-4ce7-a3a6-67a8662d28bc\/@v03B8ZV5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Radiosensitivity,Immune response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17710"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"943ba815-3c40-46b2-962e-4e86600fe49d","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/943ba815-3c40-46b2-962e-4e86600fe49d\/@v03B8ZV5\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Buhai Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yichun Zeng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiuxian Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Gu<\/i><\/presenter>.

The capacity of cancer cells to recognize DNA damages and initiate repair plays a major role in radio-resistance. Furthermore, the irradiated tumor cell death can enhance antitumor immunity by inducing antigen expression on tumor cells and activating lymphocytes. Recent evidence indicates that cancer cells can be made more sensitive to the effects of radiation (radio-sensitization) through inhibition of DNA repair pathways, and a growing body of evidence indicates that cancer immunotherapy may also have radio-sensitizing effects. The combination of radiation therapy and DDR inhibitors\/immunotherapy presents a promising strategy for cancer therapy.In order to provide guidance on clinical therapeutic strategy selection, we established a beam-focused radiation platform (RadSource 2000 X-ray irradiator) to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of fractionated radiotherapy combination in a panel of cell lines and mouse models. We have tested the combination effect of DDR inhibitor in combination with radiotherapy <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, both showing radio-sensitization effects and improvement in anti-tumor activity. We have also chosen several syngeneic models to test the combination strategy of radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 and PD-L1), and performed TIL analysis to explore the possible mechanisms of combination effect. In summary, our beam-focused radiation platform provides insights into the design of new therapeutic strategies and has become an effective tool in pre-clinical research of anti-cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6c886d79-9a5d-4109-a90a-46b903a9c423\/@v03B8ZV5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair inhibition,Immunotherapy,Radiation therapy,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17711"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Feifei Fan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a dynamic and versatile class of ncRNAs for which there is extensive evidence of these transcripts modulating epigenetic programs to affect cellular phenotypes. Our initial studies using a model of glioblastoma (GBM) tumor recurrence has revealed a number of oncogenic lncRNAs associated with therapy resistance and\/or tumor recurrence. We have validated the expression of these oncogenic lncRNAs in another cancer, pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). There have been few effective therapeutic advances made in past decades for either RMS or GBM. Radiation therapy is commonly employed alongside surgery and standard chemotherapy, especially in the case of unresectable disease, advanced disease, or upon tumor recurrence. Tumors may inherently possess or acquire resistance to radiation therapy and other treatment modalities over the course of disease. Tumor therapy resistance and recurrence are mediated by complex epigenetic programs which lead to increased capacity for DNA damage repair or tolerance of double stranded breaks. LncRNAs may regulate mechanisms of tumor recurrence and therapy resistance across multiple cancer types. The functional roles of ZFAS1 modulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition in colon cancers and SAMMSON which drives aberrant mitochondrial function in melanoma have been described. CASC19\/PCAT2, ZFAS1, DUXAP9, and SOX2-OT are overexpressed in multiple cancers with CASC19 having a significant negative association with GBM patient survival. In silico analysis identifies DNA-binding capacities harbored by these lncRNA transcripts, and their predicted binding sites are proximal to several cancer hallmark genes. We have verified the expression of isoforms of these lncRNA transcripts that contain DNA-binding domains through sequencing and qPCR. We hypothesize that these lncRNAs regulate transcriptional networks via recruitment of transcriptional or epigenetic machinery to genomic loci to modulate oncogenic programs and\/or tumor suppressor pathways. As potent epigenetic regulators, lncRNAs present an attractive class of therapeutic targets that could complement standard treatments to reduce disease burden and improve patient survival. It is possible that acquired radiation resistance mediated by lncRNAs is conserved across multiple malignancies. We are developing chemically modified, novel antisense oligonucleotides to target these transcripts in GBM and RMS patient-derived xenografts. Using these systems, we hope to reveal novel associations with disease progression and oncogenic mechanisms that could be exploited through the direct targeting of lncRNAs. We hope our work will lead to the development of novel clinical agents to treat patients with RMS, GBM, and potentially other intractable cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/326ad59a-8a24-4b50-ad08-ed69d31df4cd\/@v03B8ZV5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Long noncoding RNA,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Glioblastoma,Radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18657"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"191ab036-54a9-4012-8692-3bb24bbad69e","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/191ab036-54a9-4012-8692-3bb24bbad69e\/@v03B8ZV5\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Christian Tyler Stackhouse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Corinne Linardic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malaika Kimmons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Samantha Weitzel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, these tumors confer high levels of radioresistance based on their ability to repair DNA damaged by IR. Deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are needed for DNA repair and are produced by two pathways: de novo and salvage, which depend on ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), respectively. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) activates dCK and can be targeted with inhibitors. We hypothesized that blocking both pathways for dNTP synthesis with an ATR inhibitor (ATRi) and the RNR inhibitor (RNRi), triapine, will sensitize GEP-NETs to IR <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/>Methods: (i) The CellTiter-Glo (Promega) luminescent cell viability assay established drug sensitivities of two pancreatic NET cell lines (BON and QGP-1) for triapine and three ATRi (AZD6738, VX-970, BAY1895344). Assays were performed with at least three replicates. Data were fit using a four-parameter log-logistic model, and IC<sub>50<\/sub> values were calculated with R statistical software. (ii) Loewe synergy models were used to calculate the two-drug combination effects in both cell lines with synergy scores greater than 0 indicating synergistic effects and scores less than 0 representative of antagonistic effects. (iii) Clonogenic assays were performed and analyzed via colorimetry with sulforhodamine B to assess the effect of each drug alone and in combination with IR. (iv) Immunoblots were used to assess ATR activation following IR, RNRi, and ATRi treatments.<br \/>Results: (i) Cell viability assays showed lower IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the BON cell line compared to the QGP-1 cell line (BON cell IC<sub>50 <\/sub>: triapine 2.6&#181;M &#177; 0.6&#181;M, AZD6738 1.0&#181;M &#177; 0.2&#181;M, VX-970 204nM &#177; 20nM, BAY1895344 139nM &#177; 15nM; IC<sub>50<\/sub> in QGP-1 cells: triapine 6.1&#181;M &#177; 2.7&#181;M, AZD6738 7.9&#181;M &#177; 2.9&#181;M, VX-970 1.7&#181;M &#177; 0.5&#181;M, BAY1895344 1.1&#181;M &#177; 2.8&#181;M). (ii) Loewe synergy models estimated the combination of BAY1895344 and triapine to be synergistic with scores greater than 0 in both cell lines (BON 9.89, p-value 4.07e-11; QGP-1 15.91, p-value 1.96e-7). (iii) Clonogenic assays showed an increase in efficacy of BAY1895344 when combined with IR in both BON (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>s: 150nM &#177; 8nM without radiation versus 18nM &#177; 35nM with 2Gy) and QGP-1 cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub> values: 277nM &#177; 48nM without radiation versus 93nM &#177; 4nM with 2Gy). (iv) Western blot analysis showed strong activation of the ATR pathway with IR and triapine alone with subsequent inhibition by an ATRi.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings show that treatment of GEP-NET cell lines with inhibitors that block the de novo and salvage pathways for dNTP production markedly sensitize these cells to subsequent IR. The combination of IR with both an ATRi and an RNRi has the potential to be an effective treatment modality for GEP-NETs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e593d2b2-9d3a-4db3-9304-662f76e87f99\/@w03B8ZV6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair,Neuroendocrine tumors,Radiosensitization,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18658"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer Castle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>J.

Fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) blocks urothelial apoptosis induced by cyclophosphamide (CPP) or radiation, but there are limitations to its use in patients, including an inability to apply it by direct bladder infusion and the high cost due to the large size of the protein (18.8 kDa).<br \/>Purpose: We previously identified a small peptide that equaled or exceeded the mitigation effect of full length FGF2 on acute radiation syndrome. Benefits of developing a similar FGF7 biomimetic peptide include lower likelihood of inflammation, longer shelf life, higher purity, and lower cost than the full-length protein.<br \/>Methods: Based on the 3-dimensional structure of FGF2 peptide, a corresponding FGF7 peptide (FGF7p) consisting of 19 amino acids was identified and synthesized. FGF7p or vehicle was given subcutaneously (SQ) to female mice subjected to sham injury, intraperitoneal (IP) CPP or external beam radiation over the bladder. One day after injury, bladders were harvested. Slides with paraffin embedded tissues underwent H&#38;E staining, TUNEL and immunofluorescence (IF) assays.<br \/>Results: In uninjured control mice, a 20 mg\/kg threshold dose of FGF7p induced expression of phosphorylated (activated) FRS2a (pFRS2a) and pAKT in urothelium (consistent with cytoprotective effects of FGF7, albeit at a 4x higher dose than full length FGF7). Unexpectedly, FGF7p activation of urothelial FRS2a and AKT was delayed 24 hours compared to FGF7. FGF7p (20 mg\/kg) or vehicle was given at 72 and 48 hours prior to CPP (150 mg\/kg). One day after CPP, TUNEL staining revealed an increase in apoptotic and sloughing urothelial cells in vehicle-treated mice compared to in FGF7p-treated mice. IF for pAKT and its targets, pS6K and pBAD, revealed minimal staining in vehicle-treated mice, but strong urothelial staining for all protective markers in FGF7p-treated mice. Using the same dosing strategy, we subjected anesthetized mice to 10 Gy radiation over the bladder. One day after injury, TUNEL staining revealed many more apoptotic urothelial nuclei in control mice, than in FGF7p-treated mice.<br \/>Conclusions: FGF7p appears to block bladder urothelial apoptosis via AKT and its targets, in a similar manner to FGF7. FGF7p is 200x less expensive to make vs. FGF7 and is likely to work via direct bladder infusion (avoiding systemic side effects) due to its small size. Our future studies will clarify long term benefits of FGF7p and assess effectiveness of direct bladder infusion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0c4c357f-b995-4ec9-a77c-183cab530f25\/@w03B8ZV6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cyclophosphamide,Radiation therapy,Growth factor,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18659"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sridhar Narla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Lori P.

CD37 is highly and selectively expressed on the surface of mature B lymphocytes and B-cell malignancies. Alpha-emitting radionuclides have demonstrated potential for cancer targeted therapies because of efficient energy deposition along the short alpha track (50-100 &#181;m) causing localized and irreparable DNA damage while sparing surrounding healthy tissues. We have developed a targeted alpha therapy (TAT) where the CD37-specific antibody NNV003 is coupled to the alpha-particle-generating radioisotope <sup>212<\/sup>Pb for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Approximately 90,000 cases of CLL and NHL are expected annually in the US. Standard of care includes chemotherapy combined with anti-CD20 antibodies (obinutuzumab and rituximab) and Bruton&#8217;s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. While these therapies are initially effective, most patients inevitably relapse.<br \/><b>Materials and methods:<\/b> The efficacy and tolerability of a single dose <sup>212<\/sup>Pb-NNV003 treatment were evaluated in disseminated models using CD37-expressing human CLL (MEC-2) and Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma (Daudi) cells. Comparison to therapeutic doses of ibrutinib was investigated in the MEC-2 model. R2G2 or CB17-SCID mice were injected intravenously with 2.5&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> MEC-2 or 10&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> Daudi cells on day 0, followed by intravenous injection of <sup>212<\/sup>Pb-NNV003 (2.5, 5 or 7.5 &#181;Ci in Daudi model and 5, 10, 15 or 20 &#181;Ci in MEC-2 model) or daily oral administration of ibrutinib (12.5 or 25 mg\/kg) starting on day 2 (n=10-12 per group). <sup>212<\/sup>Pb-cetuximab (unspecific isotype control), unlabelled NNV003 and NaCl were used as controls.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In vitro testing of the antibody showed that MEC-2 cells were 5 times more resistant to ibrutinib than Daudi cells. Treatment of mice injected intravenously with Daudi cells with 2.5 &#956;Ci <sup>212<\/sup>Pb-NNV003 resulted in survival of 100 % of the mice 100 days after start of treatment, while 100 days after start of treatment with 100 &#956;g obinutuzumab only 40 % of the mice were still alive. Control mice had a median survival of 7-8 weeks. Treatment of mice injected intravenously with MEC-2 cells with 15 &#956;Ci <sup>212<\/sup>Pb-NNV003 resulted in survival of 90-100 % for more than 25 weeks in two independent experiments. Ibrutinib treated mice with intravenous MEC-2 cells presented a median survival of only 4.3-4.4 weeks, comparable to the unlabelled NNV003 and saline groups (4.1 and 4.4 weeks). Mice receiving non-specific <sup>212<\/sup>Pb-cetuximab presented a median survival of 7-9 weeks.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The study shows that a single injection <sup>212<\/sup>Pb-NNV003 is safe and effective for the treatment of CD37 positive CLL and NHL in preclinical models, with promising efficacy in both ibrutinib-resistant and sensitive CLL models. Treatment with <sup>212<\/sup>Pb-NNV003 was superior to both ibrutinib and obinutuzumab.

However, therapeutic applications of FAP-targeting radioligand therapeutics are limited by their short residence time in tumor lesions. We have recently described the discovery of OncoFAP, a novel ultra-high affinity ligand of FAP which has been already validated for PET imaging applications in more than twenty patients with solid tumors. In this abstract, we describe the development and <i>in vivo<\/i> characterization of BiOncoFAP, a dimeric FAP targeting small molecule based on OncoFAP. In particular, OncoFAP and BiOncoFAP displayed a superimposable affinity for recombinant human FAP (<i>K<\/i><sub>D<\/sub> = 970 pM and 993 pM, respectively, measured by Fluorescence Polarization). Moreover, the two ligands exhibited a clear selectivity for the target, without significantly interacting with a wide panel of non-target proteins. BiOncoFAP was coupled to a DOTAGA chelator, suitable for radiolabeling with [<sup>177<\/sup>Lu]Lu for therapeutic applications. Cold [<sup>nat<\/sup>Lu]Lu-BiOncoFAP-DOTAGA showed an excellent stability in both mouse and human serum, with half-life longer than 5 days, supporting <i>in vivo<\/i> investigations. In a head-to-head <i>in vivo <\/i>biodistribution comparative study against [<sup>177<\/sup>Lu]Lu-OncoFAP-DOTAGA, [<sup>177<\/sup>Lu]Lu-BiOncoFAP-DOTAGA exhibited a more stable and prolonged residence time in FAP-positive tumors implanted in immunodeficient mice (~20% ID\/g and ~200-to-1 tumor-to-blood ratio, 24 h after systemic administration). Notably, [<sup>177<\/sup>Lu]Lu-BiOncoFAP-DOTAGA did not significantly accumulate in healthy organs, thus showing an outstanding tumor-to-organ ratio (e.g., 12-to-1 tumor-to-kidney and 34-to-1 tumor-to-liver ratio, at the 24 h time point). These findings heighten BiOncoFAP as promising candidate for the development of anti-cancer radioligand therapeutics towards FAP-expressing tumor lesions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/25b32df6-b803-43cc-b509-b4ca2144dcdb\/@w03B8ZV6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule drugs,Targeted therapy,Tumor microenvironment,Fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20037"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Samuele Cazzamalli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Andrea Galbiati<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aureliano Zana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matilde Bocci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacopo Millul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqueline Mock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdullah Elsayed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dario Neri<\/i><\/presenter>.
