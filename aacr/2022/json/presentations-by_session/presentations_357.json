[{"Abstract":"Cancers harboring bi-allelic loss of the breast cancer genes (<i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i>) are sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), which are clinically approved in breast, ovarian, and more recently prostate cancer.

Early stage PCa cells use the more efficient TCA cycle, while metastatic PCa cells switch to glycolysis (Warburg effect), leading to the accumulation of lactate. Lactate is exported out of the cells by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) to maintain redox balance. Such metabolic reprogramming can lead to gain-of-function mutations and affect drug sensitivity. Enzalutamide is a second-generation antiandrogen used for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant PCa. However, resistance to Enzalutamide develops in most patients within 9-15 months. Since Warburg effect is a hallmark of metastatic PCa, we sought to understand whether lactate transport has any effect on Enzalutamide-resistance in PCa. We measured the expression of MCTs in parental and Enzalutamide-resistant C4-2B and 22RV1 cells and found that they are overexpressed in the Enzalutamide resistant subtypes. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that targeting lactate transport might be a potential strategy to overcome Enzalutamide-resistance in PCa cells. Using cell survival and cell proliferation assays, we found that MCT antagonists resensitized Enzalutamide resistant C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells to treatment with Enzalutamide. Using the Seahorse based glycolytic rate assay we found that these combination treatments significantly reduced the extracellular acidification rate by reducing the level of glycolysis in the Enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. We also found that treatment with these antagonists either singly, or in combination with Enzalutamide suppressed xenograft growth in SCID mice bearing subcutaneously injected parental or Enzalutamide-resistant C4-2B cells. These findings led to the conclusion that targeting MCTs could be an attractive strategy to overcome Enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0d1ba17-f7ed-4abd-832d-3e44347e88f9\/@u03B8ZEj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Enzalutamide,Metabolism,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16001"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sayani Bhattacharjee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan P.

Previously published data from our lab shows that AhR protein is overexpressed and constitutively active in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. Physiologically relevant leptin concentration is proportional to BMI and it is secreted by adipose cells to inhibit hunger under normal circumstances. Our preliminary results suggest that obesity-associated leptin concentrations desensitize PCa cells to cancer drugs however, the underlying mechanisms must be elucidated and may require sustained AhR signaling. In this study, we conducted an integrative bioinformatics analysis to explore the role of AHR and LEPR in PCa, which revealed AHR and LEPR mRNA expression positively correlates in prostate cancer (P&#60;0.05, Pearson: 0.68, R^2=0.46). The mRNA expression levels of AHR and LEPR in PCa tissue samples (i.e. solid tissue normal samples from individuals with cancer in TCGA, N=498) were analyzed using the cBioPortal and Xena online tools. We will further investigate if the decrease in drug response is seen in the presence of obesity-associated leptin concentrations.

As part of its canonical activities, the androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role in PCa metabolism. AR inhibition with ARPI subjects PCa cells to acute metabolic stress caused by reduced biosynthesis and energy production. The upregulation of ARPI-induced stress response mechanisms is essential adaptive mechanism for cell proliferation and survival. This process requires PCa cells undergoing rapid phenotypic changes to adapt to their environment and circumvent lethal outcomes. By profiling the proteomic pathway alterations associated with the ARPI stress response in LNCaP cells, we noted a significant upregulation of chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA), a stress response mechanism yet to be defined in PCa. CMA, a selective protein degradation pathway, specifically targets protein substrates via a CMA recognition motif and is an essential survival mechanism in cancer cells during energy depleted metabolic stress. Within in-vitro and in-vivo PCa models, ARPI induced CMA is reflected through the increased activity of CMA lysosomes and specifically by the increased expression of the CMA marker, lysosomal associated membrane protein 2a (L2A). L2A knockdown using shRNA not only elicited a strong anti-proliferative effect in PCa cells, but also compromised PCa metabolism with decreases in ATP levels and mTORC1 signaling. Proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry further identified that CMA promotes chromatin silencing, and the suppression of pathways associated with transcription. Conversely, L2A overexpression not only promoted PCa cell proliferation during Enza treatment, but upregulated of hallmark target genes of AR-indifferent PCa growth. The upregulation of CMA facilitated proteome remodeling during ARPI, leading to increased mTORC1 signaling and biosynthesis. In summary, our data illustrates the importance of CMA in mediating the ARPI stress response in PCa, providing novel insights into the mechanisms of ARPI treatment resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03e26582-f8cc-47f7-94bb-e0ecf023daa3\/@u03B8ZEj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Therapy resistance,Enzalutamide,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16003"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicholas Nikesitch<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eliana Beraldi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hans Adomat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Bell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ladan Fazli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Wells<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Pinette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuzhuo Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Gleave<\/i><\/presenter>.

ENZ combined with increasing NRG-1 concentration induced LNCaP cell death in an additive manner, but NRG-1 rescued Du145 &#38; PC3 from ENZ-induced death in a dose-dependent manner. We next hypothesized that differential NRG-1 downstream signaling is mediated by engagement with distinct EGFR receptor dimers. While HER2 expression is similar, LNCaP express higher HER3 than Du145 &#38; PC3. High ratio of HER2 to HER3 in Du145 &#38; PC3 mirrors clinical reports of HER2 upregulation in CRPC<sup>5,6<\/sup> and also predicts patient survival in the Stand Up to Cancer cohort.<sup>7<\/sup> Significantly, we recapitulated the CRPC phenotype in LNCaP by inducing HER2 overexpression, HER3 suppression, and chemically-mediated HER2\/HER3 dimerization. Conversely, HER2 knockdown sensitized Du145 cells to ENZ. Next, we queried composite single-cell whole human<sup>8<\/sup> and CRPC<sup>9<\/sup> transcriptomes for NRG-1 expression and discovered that the source of NRG-1 is the patients&#8217; own mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Bone-derived MSC outgrowth cells produced copious NRG-1, which was increased substantially by coincubation with prostate cancer cell supernatants. Importantly, we were able to manipulate MSCs to reduce their NRG-1 production as a possible clinical translation. Similarly, patients treated with these compounds showed significant reduction in plasma NRG-1 levels after treatment. Additional clinical studies are pending. Together, our observations confirm that NRG-1 has differential signaling: HER3 homodimerization leads to prostate cancer cell death, whereas heterodimerization of HER3 with HER2 leads to prostate cancer cell survival via ADT resistance in a plasma NRG-1 dependent manner. Consequently, HER2 and HER3 receptor availability determine the molecular switch of NRG-1 in prostate cancer. Therefore, NRG-1 can be both a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in CRPC, and multiple clinical trials are pending.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41f993a5-76a8-4509-a897-8c8122763340\/@u03B8ZEj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Resistance,Androgen independence,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16005"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"3f92a686-11cb-440d-8d69-c1b410a1ae76","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3f92a686-11cb-440d-8d69-c1b410a1ae76\/@u03B8ZEj\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jacob Orme<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roman Thaler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dejie Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siven Chinniah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Hirdler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fernando Quevedo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lance Pagliaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kwon Eugene<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Bryce<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Costello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haojie Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

Prostate cancer initially responds to androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapies (e.g., enzalutamide, darolutamide). However, therapy-resistant, aggressive, lethal malignancy invariably develops for which no effective, targeted treatment options are available. Though failures of AR-targeted therapies remain as major cause for mortality among prostate cancer patients, molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of resistance are still to be fully characterized.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To understand the molecular basis of enzalutamide resistance, we developed a prostate cancer cell model to mimic the clinical conditions in enzalutamide-resistant disease. These cells were transcriptionally profiled for gene expression analysis by Illumina Hi-Seq whole genome gene-expression array. Hits were validated by RT-qPCR and Western blot. For clinical correlation, samples from enzalutamide treated prostate PDX models as well as surgical prostate tumors from patients were comprehensively analyzed. Role of new hits were determined by lentiviral shRNAs and analysis of cell viability, apoptosis, and downstream targets. Pro-cancer effects were analyzed by cell proliferation, invasion, and soft-agar colony formation.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified that the Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase is overexpressed in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer (ERPC) cells. Elevated level of TRIB2 was also observed in enzalutamide treated PDX tumors in mice, and in prostate tumors from patients who were treated with enzalutamide. We found that TRIB2 protein level is especially higher in prostate cancer cells where the AR activity is low, or absent due to genetic changes. Forced overexpression of TRIB2 results in aggressive prostate cancer cell growth and makes the cells resistant to enzalutamide. Conversely, inhibition of TRIB2 by shRNA or chemical inhibitor decreases viability and re-sensitizes ERPC cells back to enzalutamide, suggesting that TRIB2 plays an important role as a driver in the resistance mechanism. Interestingly, TRIB2 downregulates luminal markers, but upregulates neuroendocrine markers via the master neuronal transcription factor, BRN2, and the reprogramming factor, SOX2. Inhibition of either BRN2 or SOX2 also re-sensitizes ERPC cells to enzalutamide.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>These findings suggest that TRIB2 confers resistance to enzalutamide therapy through lineage switching from luminal to neuroendocrine type, involving BRN2 and SOX2. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c6bb0fbd-ac0d-46d8-be6f-ddee60d58c3e\/@v03B8ZEk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Neuroendocrine differentiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16006"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jitender Monga<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Indra Adrianto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Craig Rogers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shirish Gadgeel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhananjay Chitale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jagadananda Ghosh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our previous studies demonstrated that docetaxel (DTX)-resistant PCa cells activates a transcriptomic program associated with stemness and display cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, consistent with the notion that CSCs within prostate tumors contribute to chemoresistance. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling is a critical mediator of resistance to AR-targeted therapy, and has been recently implicated in the development of PCa cell tumorsphere formation and chemoresistance. Like GR, &#946;-catenin is overexpressed in metastatic and therapy-resistant tumors, and is considered a key regulator of cancer stemness and androgen-targeted therapy resistance. Given the structural and functional overlap between GR and AR, a known interacting partner of &#946;-catenin, we hypothesized that GR also interacts with &#946;-catenin to support stemness and chemoresistance in PCa cells. We observed that treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone induces enhanced nuclear accumulation of both GR and &#946;-catenin in DTX-resistant PCa cells compared to their DTX-sensitive counterparts. Knockdown studies revealed that GR and &#946;-catenin do no regulate each other at the protein level. However, using whole cell and nuclear co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated the interaction between GR and &#946;-catenin in both DTX-resistant and DTX-sensitive PC3, DU145, and 22RV1 cells. Pharmacological inhibition and RNA interference-mediated silencing of GR with concomitant inhibition of &#946;-catenin enhanced DTX cytotoxicity in resistant PCa cells grown in both adherent and spheroid cultures, and decreased CD44+\/CD24- cell populations in tumorspheres. These results indicate that both GR and &#946;-catenin interact and influence stemness, and may be promising therapeutic targets to overcome PCa chemoresistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/072b5895-7e69-40cf-8c0d-f409c25526ee\/@v03B8ZEk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Resistance,Glucocorticoid receptor,&#946;-catenin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16007"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shannalee R.

Despite the use of taxane-based chemotherapies Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel, mCRPC remains lethal due to chemoresistance. We recently identified FKBP7 as a potential therapeutic target of interest in PCa. FKBP7 is overexpressed in taxane-resistant PCa cells and impacts both cell proliferation and Docetaxel efficacy in chemoresistant models. We demonstrated FKBP7 affects translation and binds to the translation initiation complex eIF4F. FKBP7 is an ER-resident FKBP, but its properties remain poorly described.<br \/><b><i><u>Methods<\/u>:<\/i><\/b> FKBP7 expression upon chemotherapy treatment was assessed by Western Blot and correlation between FKBP7 expression and clinical prognosis was examined on public cancer databases. Subcellular localization of FKBP7 was addressed by digitonin-based fractionation. Finally, FKBP7-predicted structure was obtained with structural modeling servers and sequence alignments were performed on AliView. We then produced and purified the recombinant catalytic domain of FKBP7 and collected high quality <sup>15<\/sup>N HSQC NMR spectra. Afterwards, we examined its interaction with well-known FKBP ligands.<br \/><b><i><u>Results<\/u>: <\/i><\/b>Increased FKBP7 expression was observed upon treatment with several cytotoxic chemotherapies in PCa-cell lines, and TCGA data underlined FKBP7 impacts survival in other cancers than PCa. Together, this suggests an enlarged potential involvement of FKBP7 in adaptive resistance. Mechanistically, in taxane-resistant models, FKBP7 overexpression did not result from higher protein stability but rather from a transcriptional regulation. Preliminary results of subcellular fractionation showed FKBP7 is present in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and seems to localize in the cytosol, independently of proteasomal degradation. We also confirmed FKBP7 is N45-glycosylated and observed that cytosolic-FKBP7 appears mainly glycosylated. This suggests that the ER-resident FKBP7 could be refluxed in the cytosol depending on its glycosylation state to regulate the activity of the cytosolic eIF4F complex. We are currently validating this hypothesis. At last, structural modeling predicted a FKBP-type fold with a potential FKBP7 substrate specificity as its catalytic pocket presents distinct composition for charge and bulkiness compared to other FKBPs. Accordingly, FKBP7 strongly binds Rapamycin and Everolimus, but surprisingly not FK506, confirming a selective binding profile.<br \/><b><i><u>Conclusion<\/u>: <\/i><\/b>Our work depicts the recently identified FKBP7\/eIF4F pathway in PCa-resistance and points atypical properties for the ER-resident FKBP7. It also indicates FKBP7 could be a druggable target in adaptive resistance of other solid cancers.

Despite this, the transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility changes contributing to the emergence of resistance remain incompletely understood at the level of individual cells. Using single-cell assays for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) and RNA sequencing in models of early treatment response and resistance to enzalutamide, we previously identified pre-existing and persistent cell subpopulations that possess regenerative potential when subjected to treatment. Here we analyze the chromatin and transcriptomes of these single cells to characterize their gene regulation and gene expression trajectories. We present evidence of a model of enzalutamide resistance emergence in which the pre-existing and treatment-persistent cells regenerate the bulk of resistant cells. This process is underpinned by chromatin reprogramming that increases the overall relaxation of chromatin upon resistance. We show that the reprogramming of the chromatin further differentially contributes to transcription factor-mediated transcriptional reprogramming via DNA motif exposure in different cell subpopulations. For example, in the treatment-persistent cells, we identify chromatin configurations characterized by the exposure of DNA motifs for GATA2, RELA (a NFkB subunit), CREB1, and E2F1. Pre-existing and treatment-persistent cells consistently display transcriptional features of high developmental potential and RNA velocity analysis identifies them as precursors of cell populations that arise from enzalutamide treatment. We also analyze the pre-existing and treatment-persistent cells in spatial transcriptomics of prostate cancer patient specimens based on their characteristic gene expression profiles.

It has been shown that simultaneous targeting of multiple nodes in the RAS\/RAF\/MEK\/ERK (MAPK) pathway may be optimal for durable response. Furthermore, acquired mutations in the MAPK pathway occur clinically upon progression on adagrasib. Therefore, clinical combinations with G12Ci are needed. VS-6766 is a unique dual RAF\/MEK inhibitor. In contrast to MEK-only inhibitors (MEKi), VS-6766 is a potent allosteric inhibitor of MEK kinase activity and induces a dominant negative RAF\/MEK complex preventing phosphorylation of MEK by BRAF and CRAF. The combination of VS-6766 with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor defactinib with an intermittent schedule has shown clinical activity for patients with KRAS G12V and KRAS G12C mt NSCLC with a manageable safety profile relative to MEKi. Here, we tested whether combination of G12Ci with VS-6766 for vertical blockade of RAS, RAF and MEK might yield superior pathway blockade and antitumor efficacy. In 3D proliferation assays, VS-6766 was synergistic with both sotorasib and adagrasib in reducing viability of a panel of KRAS G12C mt cancer cell lines. Accordingly, VS-6766 effectively suppressed MAPK pathway signaling (pMEK, pERK) as a single agent, and the combination of VS-6766 + G12Ci showed improved depth and duration of MAPK pathway inhibition relative to G12Ci alone in KRAS G12C mt NSCLC models in vitro and in vivo. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis showed stronger inhibition of cell cycle\/proliferation markers (e.g. aurora A\/B, cyclin B1, pRb, pCDK1, pS6) with the combination than with VS-6766 or G12Ci alone. Additionally, the combination showed stronger activation of pro-apoptotic markers (e.g. cleaved caspase 7) and potential resistance markers (e.g. pFAK) than either agent alone. We are currently testing VS-6766 against a panel of cell lines expressing mutations identified in patients progressing on adagrasib. In KRAS G12C mt NSCLC models in vivo, VS-6766 combination augmented tumor growth inhibition by sotorasib, whereas trametinib combination was much less effective in augmenting sotorasib efficacy. In the H358 KRAS G12C mt NSCLC model, sotorasib monotherapy or sotorasib + trametinib failed to induce substantial tumor regression, whereas sotorasib + VS-6766 induced &#62;25% tumor regression in 10\/10 mice. Similarly, in the H2122 KRAS G12C mt NSCLC model, sotorasib + VS-6766 induced &#62;20% tumor regression in 5\/10 mice while sotorasib or sotorasib + trametinib were relatively ineffective. These results support the imminent clinical evaluation of VS-6766 in combination with a G12C inhibitor for treatment of KRAS G12C mt NSCLC in both G12Ci na&#239;ve patients and patients progressing on G12Ci treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9aa1a844-d4c2-4237-8a80-7844b7c47c21\/@v03B8ZEk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,NSCLC,G12C inhibitor,RAF\/MEK inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16140"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Silvia Coma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjib Chowdhury<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Dilly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Musteanu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariano Barbacid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew J.

Various RET fusions and point mutations were shown to play a role as oncogene drivers in different cancers. In 2020, two selective RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), pralsetinib and selpercatinib, were approved by the FDA for treatment of RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer, RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer and RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer. These drugs demonstrate a significant advance in efficacy and safety over previous, multi-targeted TKIs for the treatment of RET-positive patients. However, development of acquired resistance to these agents has been observed through the appearance of on-target secondary solvent front mutations in the RET G810 residue. Moreover, 5 different types of amino acid changes - G810A\/C\/R\/S\/V have been identified in this position, of which G810C, G810R and G810S are better characterized but their effect on protein activity is lacking. We used a high-throughput functional assay, in which the mutated protein is expressed together with a fluorescently labeled reporter in a cell-based assay. Using this system, we systematically assessed the activity of different combinations of RET fusions or oncogenic point mutations with one of three different common solvent front mutations and compared them to the activity of the individual mutations. Our results show that when a solvent front mutation is expressed on a RET oncogenic point mutation background, the solvent front mutation consistently decreases the oncogenic protein activity. This is supported by our observation that the individual solvent front mutations expressed on a RET WT background show an activity that is lower than that of the RET WT protein. On a RET fusion background the effect of solvent front mutations is more variable, with some RET fusion-solvent front mutation combinations showing a decreased activity and some not affecting the activity of the fusion protein. Across all mutations and fusions tested, the G810R and G810C mutations had a larger effect on RET activity than that of the G810S mutation. We also compared the effect of drug treatment (pralsetinib and selpercatinib) on RET oncogenic activity in the presence of the different solvent front mutations and observed that on all mutational backgrounds tested, the solvent front mutations have an effect on the response dynamics to the drug, and that the extent of the effect depends on the type of solvent front mutation, with G810R and G810C decreasing sensitivity to drug treatment to a larger extent compared to G810S. Together, our findings provide a better understanding of the differential effects of solvent front mutations on RET activity under different oncogenic contexts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d525f50d-aee3-4274-ac20-ed9263d510c3\/@v03B8ZEk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RET,Resistance,Precision medicine,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16141"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shay Rotkopf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>DIkla Haham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lea Birnbaum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zohar Barbash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gabi Tarcic<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Several mechanisms of resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors have been proposed, including feedback mechanisms and activation of complementary signaling pathways, which have led to the development of combination therapies. Ulixertinib (BVD-523), a first-in-class and ERK1\/2 inhibitor, is clinically effective in patients with tumors harboring alterations in the MAPK pathway. In this project, we have developed resistance clones to ulixertinib and have identified mechanisms of acquired resistance using RNA-seq analysis, thus enabling us to identify potential combination partners to combat resistance.<br \/>In vitro experiments were deployed to develop resistance models to ulixertinib. Resistance clones were developed by culturing A375 cell line (melanoma; BRAF V600E) in escalating concentrations of ulixertinib.<br \/>RNA-sequencing was performed on the parental model and the resistance clones following varying treatment conditions with ulixertinib. RNAseq and principal component analysis revealed strong differences between parental and resistance clones, with further differentiation between acute high concentration and chronic treatment models compared to models treated with acute, lower concentrations of ulixertinib. These results highlight the presence of a dose-dependent resistance phenotype. Differential gene expression analysis revealed enrichment of several pathways, including MAPK, autophagy, focal adhesion, JAK\/STAT, and VEGF. Interestingly, we observed rewiring of PI3K\/AKT by shifting the signaling from EGFR to ERBB2 in the resistance models. The magnitude of changes in these genes and pathways also exhibited a dose-dependent effect, with higher concentration models showing a higher fold-change compared to the lower concentration models. We explored these hypotheses by performing combination experiments with ulixertinib in the generated resistance clones. Synergistic combination targets in the ulixertinib resistance clones included ERBB2, and FAK. We also validated combinations with autophagy inhibitors, one of which is now being tested in a Phase I clinical trial (NCT04145297).<br \/>In summary, we have identified some potential resistance mechanisms to ulixertinib and have validated key genes\/pathways which may act as synergistic combination targets. This work not only informs future clinical development for ulixertinib but also improves our understanding of the complex interplay between the MAPK and other signaling pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/094279c3-520e-4656-a9bd-1eec4cc3e5dd\/@v03B8ZEk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,Resistance,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16142"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anupama Reddy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Sorrell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deborah Knoerzer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline M.

The opportunistic uptake of extracellular molecules has been named as a key emerging hallmark of cancer metabolism. In tumor microenvironment, intratumoral extracellular ATP (eATP) levels are 1,000 times or more higher than those in corresponding normal tissues. Our previous studies have shown that eATP can be taken up by cancer cell via macropinocytosis, leading to substantial increase in intracellular ATP levels. We found that this high intracellular ATP levels contribute to drug resistance in several ways: first, it directly fueled and enhanced drug-pumping activity of major ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters, which are located in plasma membrane and can pump out a wide range of substrates including anticancer drugs, leading to reduced intracellular drug retention. Secondly, ATP treatment upregulated gene expression of the major ABC transporters, and this gene regulatory effect of ATP was comparable to TGF-beta, which is a well-established epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer, and EMT is known to induce ABC transporter expression and drug resistance. Moreover, eATP treatment led to an increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels, probably by enhancing GSH synthesis. Increased GSH levels have been described to significantly contribute to drug resistance. We also found eATP altered cellular redox state, which potentially stimulates EMT. Furthermore, we performed RNA-sequencing and identified several genes that may serve as downstream factors of eATP in promoting EMT and drug resistance. We are currently investigating the roles of these genes by knocking down gene expression or knocking out these genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4fd0b93c-65a6-4f7c-a8b9-52a421811af4\/@w03B8ZEm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ABC transporters,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Glutathione,Redox,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16143"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haiyun Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaozhuo Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although studies over the past decade revealed that AXL is upregulated during treatment, the biological significance and the mechanism by which AXL is activated upon chemotherapy are yet to be determined. In this study, we aim to understand the biology of AXL mediated chemo-resistance, and the consequences of AXL activation. To investigate the biological significance of AXL, we generated iRFP-luciferase-expressing cell lines which facilitate live monitoring of cancer progression during treatment in an <i>in vivo<\/i> setting. In parallel, by knocking down AXL using shRNA, we observed inhibitory effect on cell migration and tumor forming efficiency <i>in vitro<\/i>. Moreover, using <i>in vitro<\/i> cell based models, we showed that while AXL expression was upregulated upon treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, pharmacological inhibition of AXL caused synergistic effect between selective AXL inhibitors and cisplatin. Additionally, our data suggest that upregulation of AXL and its tyrosine phosphorylation may mediate resistance to chemotherapy. Using phosphoproteomics, we identified a link between CDK9 activation and drug-induced AXL expression. We showed that while AXL expression was upregulated upon treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor, pharmacological inhibition of CDK9 completely blocked AXL expression. Collectively, our data suggest that activation of kinase signaling might be required for AXL repression, and thereby, for targeting AXL-axis in chemotherapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ebb9c3df-24e2-4514-b6cb-4896a2300909\/@w03B8ZEm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Axl,Tyrosine kinase receptors,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16144"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mehreen Ahmed<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julhash Uddin Kazi<\/i><\/presenter>.

OTS964 is a potent T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) inhibitor. Herein, we investigated the interaction of OTS964 and MDR-associated ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2, breast cancer resistance protein\/BCRP). The cell viability assay indicated that the effectiveness of OTS964 is limited in drug-resistant and gene-transfected cells overexpressing ABCG2. We found that the known ABCG2 inhibitor is able to sensitize ABCG2-overexpressing cells to OTS964. In mechanism-based studies, OTS964 shows inhibitory effect on the efflux function mediated by ABCG2, and in turn, affects the pharmacokinetic profile of other ABCG2 substrate-drugs. Furthermore, OTS964 upregulates ABCG2 protein and mRNA expression levels, resulting in enhanced resistance to ABCG2 substrate-drugs. The ATPase assay demonstrated that OTS964 stimulates ATPase activity of ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner, and that this stimulation can be antagonized by a verified ABCG2 ATPase inhibitor. Additionally, the computational molecular docking analysis combined with results from ATPase assay suggested that OTS964 interacts with drug-binding pocket of ABCG2 protein and has substrate-like behaviors. Thus, OTS964 is an MDR-susceptible agent due to its interactions with ABCG2, and overexpression of ABCG2 transporter may attenuate its therapeutic effect in cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b793653-9349-4387-be78-8eed4f61b3ec\/@w03B8ZEm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multidrug resistance,ABC transporters,ABCG2,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16145"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuqi Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhuo-Xun Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing-Quan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiu-Xu Teng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zi-Ning Lei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabrina Lusvarghi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suresh V.

This capability to develop resistance is in part due to cancer cell&#8217;s ability to activate alternative pathways and modulate tumor microenvironment to enhance cell survival, evade cell death and immunosurveillance. One such mechanism of developing resistance to SoC is the activation of the NOTCH pathway. NOTCH signaling is a developmental pathway which is known to be activated in several human cancers as a key oncogenic hit. In addition to its role as an oncogenic driver, activation of NOTCH is also known to induce resistance to several anti-cancer therapeutics in breast cancer and colorectal cancer. NOTCH signaling is known to cooperate with parallel oncogenic signals to impede activity of several drugs as a single agent. Previous agents targeting the NOTCH pathway upstream of the transcription complex were halted early in clinical development due to dose-limiting toxicities.Here we report activity of a novel first-in-class clinical stage CSL-NICD inhibitor in a panel of cell lines, xenograft and PDX models of human cancers in combination with several chemo and targeted therapies.

Our recent study characterized the MET inhibitor tepotinib as a potent ABCB1 inhibitor. In the present study, we demonstrated the MET inhibitor tepotinib effectively antagonized ABCG2-mediated MDR <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In addition, the ABCB1\/ABCG2 double-transfected cell model demonstrated that tepotinib can simultaneously inhibit the two MDR transporters. Mechanistically, tepotinib stimulated ABCG2 ATPase activity without altering the protein expression level of ABCG2, MET, or p-MET. Moreover, the MDR reversal effect may be attributed to its reversible inhibition of ABCG2 substrate efflux function, thereby sensitizing the drug-resistant cancer cells to substrate drugs. The molecular docking analysis suggested that tepotinib may directly bind to the drug-binding site of ABCG2, which subsequently block the binding of ABCG2 substrates. Animal study showed that tepotinib significantly increased the intratumor accumulation of ABCG2 substrate drug topotecan and enhanced its antitumor effect in ABCG2-overexpressing tumors.

The CHOP-resistant cells were used in high-throughput screening of a highly diverse collection of approximately 50,000 drug-like molecules to identify small molecules that reverse CHOP-resistance. The FDA-approved drug, Rifabutin, was identified as a non-cytotoxic compound that potently reversed resistance to CHOP. Structure-Activity-Relationships (SAR) on Rifabutin were conducted, which led to the generation of a new more potent CHOP-chemosensitizing agent, designated RTI.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RTI was highly synergistic with variety of chemotherapeutics, including doxorubicin (DOX), epirubicin, vinblastine, etoposide in drug-resistant NHL cells. Combination therapy of DOX+RTI in mouse xenograft models of DLBCL was much more effective at repressing tumor growth than with DOX alone. RTI lowered the IC<sub>90<\/sub> in a dose-dependent manner in CD20-positive B cells in bone marrow aspirates from both CHOP-na&#239;ve and CHOP-relapsed patients, and in a metastatic lymph node. RTI&#8217;s PK characteristics are similar to rifabutin, and it exhibited no overt toxicity in mice or pigs at high doses. RTI rapidly induced mitochondrial superoxide, membrane potential, and fission. The superoxide dismutase, FeTCP, antagonized RTI-induced ROS and potentiation of DOX cytotoxicity. RTI reduced the activity of the Nrf-2 antioxidant protein, upregulated proteins involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and induced metabolic reprogramming as indicated by Seahorse assays that showed increased glycolysis and decreased oxygen consumption from 3 to 24 hrs.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> RTI has a broad spectrum of action in both double- and triple-hit DLBCL and synergizes with many different chemotherapeutics to restore drug sensitivity. RTI-79 works by dramatically increasing intracellular superoxide through redox cycling, triggers UPR, and downregulates Nrf-2 activity. Thus, RTI-79 increases oxidative stress through the squelching of Nrf-2&#8217;s ability to respond to chemotherapeutic stress. Since the parent compound, rifabutin, binds to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and modulates its activity, we hypothesize that RTI mediates its unique pleiotropic chemosensitizing mechanism through targeting of AhR, and provides for a broad, safe, and novel approach to treating drug resistant cancers. Ongoing experiments are investigating the effect of RTI on the AhR-signaling pathway and the role it plays in RTI-mediated chemosensitization and potentiation of chemotherapeutics. A clinical trial of companion dogs with CHOP-relapsed DLBCL treated with combination CHOP+RTI is currently in progress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c9b73716-aa00-41d7-a8b4-06ffdcdb82fe\/@w03B8ZEm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Oxidative stress,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16148"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Steve A.

However, inhibitors of components of the pathway have only modest antitumor effects and, in some instances, have resulted in &#8220;tumor flares&#8221; in patients upon cessation of therapy. Low efficacy has been attributed to toxicity and to adaptive resistance. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway has been associated with relief of feedback inhibition of receptor signaling (RTKs) by a variety of mechanisms including increased receptor expression and decreased expression of the PTEN phosphatase, a major negative regulator of the pathway. Now we show that changes in expressions of RTKs, PTEN, anti-apoptosis proteins like Mcl1 and transcription factors known to drive oncogenic and survival programs in tumors like c-Myc, c-Jun, FOXOs are induced upon continuous long-term PI3K inhibition (2 weeks and longer). These changes increase as a function of duration of inhibition and become less reversible with time in drug. Unbiased clustering of RNA seq of cells treated with PI3K inhibitors revealed clusters of gene expression changes based upon short or long-term inhibition. Correspondingly the mRNA of the RTKs and transcription factors change with similar kinetics as that of the proteins and become less reversible with duration of inhibition. Moreover, the persister cells treated with PI3K inhibitors for 2 weeks or longer grow faster than the treatment naive cells upon drug removal both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> and the degree of reversibility of the increased proliferation rate is inversely proportional to the duration of inhibition. Persister cells treated with PI3K inhibitors for more than two weeks have higher levels of expression of a set of transcription factors, RTKs, Mcl1 and of pAKT after one week of drug wash-out and are less sensitive to re-inhibition of PI3K. Combined inhibition of PI3K with Mcl1 inhibitors lead to greater reduction of cell proliferation and increased cell death.This suggests that continuous long-term inhibition of PI3K leads to a chronic adaptive state driven by relief of negative feedback which becomes less reversible with increasing duration of inhibition. Cells undergoing long term inhibition have higher steady state levels of components of the pathway leading to increased cell growth upon drug removal as compared to untreated cells. The data suggests that induction of adaptive resistance is in part responsible for the continued persistence of tumor masses after the initial response to targeted therapy. We hypothesize that pulsatile targeted inhibition with short intervals off therapy could avoid development of chronic adaptation. Intermittent administration of PI3K inhibitor combinations that<i> <\/i>cause potent induction of cell death may result in improved therapeutic outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b99bbee-f2da-41bb-9854-502251291636\/@w03B8ZEm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,Inhibitors,Drug Resistance,Adaptation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16150"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Radha Mukherjee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa De Stanchina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarat Chandarlapaty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neal Rosen<\/i><\/presenter>.

To better understand mechanisms of resistance in this agent class, we established three lung XPDX models designated ST5185B, ST5431B, and ST5489 from patients before therapy with a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-i. We also established one colorectal XPDX, designated ST4859, post therapy. Once established these models were molecularly characterized, in vivo sensitivity to sotorasib and adagrasib determined, and results compared with clinical response. Ex vivo cultures and 3D-XPDX<sup>TM<\/sup><sub> <\/sub>studies were also performed evaluating both compounds comparing drug sensitivity.<br \/>Methods: Lung: ST5185B was established from a pretreated 68-year-old male; ST5431B was established from a chemo-na&#239;ve 67-year-old male; additional samples were collected during and after progression on KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-i and are currently in development. ST5489 was established from a pretreated 64-year-old female. CRC: ST4859 was established from a 57-year-old female pretreated with a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-i; all patients received at least one cycle of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-i therapy. Models were WES and RNA sequenced and sotorasib and adagrasib sensitivity determined. For each study, agents were dosed PO once daily at 100 mg\/kg; study endpoints included tumor volume and time from treatment initiation with %T\/C values reported at study completion; a %T\/C of &#8804; 20% was considered sensitive.<br \/>Results: In all models sequencing confirmed KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> and other variants previously identified with clinical studies. In vivo studies identified ST5185B as resistant to sotorasib (%T\/C=70%) and adagrasib (%T\/C=86%); this donor patient progressed after six weeks on KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-i therapy. ST5431B reported sensitivity to both therapies; this donor patient had a partial response (50% decrease) for six months prior to progression. ST5489 reported sensitivity to sotorasib (%T\/C=14%) and adagrasib (%T\/C=8%); this donor patient interrupted dosing due to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-i intolerance and discontinued therapy, with disease progression after five weeks. ST4859 reported resistance to both drugs; this donor patient had stable disease on KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-i therapy for approximately seven months prior to progression. Ex vivo cultures and 3D-XPDX<sup>TM<\/sup><sub> <\/sub>studies from all models reported sensitivity to both agents similar to in vivo studies.<br \/>Summary: We developed, evaluated, and correlated in vivo sensitivity of sotorasib and adagrasib in a panel of four XPDX models established from patients receiving KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-i therapy.

While combined MEK and PI3K inhibition is effective in preclinical models, toxicity of this combination prevents its clinical use. Alternative strategies for treating <i>RAS<\/i>-mutated cancers are essential. Therapeutics directly targeting mutated RAS proteins have the potential to spare normal cellular function thereby lessening overall toxicity. Unfortunately, direct RAS inhibition as a monotherapy does not fully block RAS effector signaling. RAS proteins show differential activation of RAF and PI3K pathways: KRAS potently activates RAF but poorly activates PI3K, whereas HRAS potently activates PI3K but poorly activates RAF. Further, mutant RAS inhibition relieves negative feedback controls leading to rapid hyperactivation of RTK&#8722;WT RAS signaling. A more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between mutant RAS and RTK&#8722;WT RAS signaling is essential to developing rational therapeutic approaches to treat <i>RAS<\/i>-mutated cancers. We found that WT RAS enhanced mutant RAS-driven transformation by activating RAS effectors poorly engaged by mutated RAS. Further, inhibition of RAS effectors activated poorly by mutant RAS synergized with and limited resistance to mutant HRAS and KRAS inhibitors. The mutant HRAS inhibitor tipifarnib blocked PI3K signaling and synergized with MEK inhibitors in <i>HRAS<\/i>-mutated cancer cell lines; covalent KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors blocked MEK signaling and synergized with PI3K inhibitors in <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>-mutated cell lines. Synergy between inhibitors of mutant RAS and RAS effectors was dependent on intact RTK\/WT RAS signaling and was lost in both RASless or SOSless MEFs. Upstream of RAS, the RASGEFs SOS1 and SOS2 showed unique and overlapping functions to promote mutant RAS-driven transformation. SOS1 was critical for mutant RAS (G12V) activation and SOS1 inhibition augmented the efficacy of mutant RAS inhibitors. RTK&#8722;SOS2&#8722;PI3K signaling protected cells from anoikis and mediated mutant KRAS-driven transformation. These results should inform the design of clinical trials for patients with <i>RAS<\/i>-mutated cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0328c620-90e6-499b-a620-0dd97a894460\/@w03B8ZEm\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras oncogene,Therapeutic resistance ,Therapeutic synergy,SOS1\/2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20548"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nancy E.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations have significantly improved patient&#180;s treatment with these alterations. However, 15-20% of EGFR-mutated patients do not respond to the therapy, even harboring the same mutations than responders. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in this primary resistance. This work aims to characterize molecular aberrations in clones with intrinsic resistance to first and third generation EGFR-TKIs generated from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Three Erlotinib-sensitive (HCC827, PC9 and H4006) and one Osimertinib-sensitive (H1975) NSCLC cell lines were used to generate primary resistance models through a pulsatile method in which cells were treated with a high concentration of the TKI during a short period of time. Survivor colonies were individually expanded in the presence of the inhibitor until resistant cell lines were established. Exome, transcriptome and methylome were then analyzed in selected clones. Erlotinib- and Osimertinib-resistant clones exhibited cross-resistance to other EGFR-targeted therapies, such as Afatinib and Cetuximab, but not to the chemotherapeutics Carboplatin or Cisplatin. Among derived clones, we found several genetic alterations in genes associated with TKI acquired resistance, including NTRK1, ARID2, ERBB3, RET, and other genes. MET amplification was exclusively associated with resistant HCC827-derived clones. We also identified non-genetic alterations that include increased expression and over-activation of well-known TKI resistance-associated proteins, such as AXL, FGFR1, or AKT, as well as induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness-related genes. Transcriptome and methylome analyses revealed EMT plasticity among resistant clones that could reflect different EMT states conferring resistance in pre-treated tumors. Molecular inhibition of MET, a recognized resistance mechanism, sensitizes MET-amplified resistant clones to Erlotinib. Combination treatments or genetic inhibitions will be further performed to validate our findings. Taken together, our results suggest that multiple genetic and non-genetic alterations already present before TKI treatment could account for primary resistance. We will employ integrative analysis of our multi-omic data to identify novel targets that allow to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance. Further clinical validation will help to prospectively select the best treatment option for EGFR-mutated patients for the sake of precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6d488050-e776-4ee3-a1ac-3b24f141bd21\/@w03B8ZEm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Precision medicine,EGFR TKI resistance,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16154"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juan Manuel Coya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Álvarez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Gómez-Sánchez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aranzazu Rosado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Ferrer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Paz-Ares<\/i><\/presenter>.

Clinical acquired resistance has been described by others for numerous efficacious small molecule agents. Relevant to the MAPK pathway, emergence of resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors limits their clinical efficacy.<br \/>In vitro models of ulixertinib resistance were generated in an endeavor to characterize and predict potential clinical mechanisms of resistance and guide rational combination therapies. The BRAF-V600E mutant melanoma cell line, A375, was cultured in progressively increasing concentrations of ulixertinib or other MAPK pathway inhibitors (dabrafenib and\/or trametinib). Drug-resistant A375 clones were readily obtained following growth in high concentrations of dabrafenib or trametinib. In contrast, developing resistance to ulixertinib proved challenging. Eventually, ulixertinib resistant clones emerged and demonstrated varying degrees of cross-resistance to other MAPK pathway inhibitors and displayed bell-shaped dose-response curves indicative of drug addiction for optimal proliferation. To elucidate potential mechanisms of resistance, Reverse Phase Protein Array profiling of 306 proteins was performed on parental A375 and ulixertinib-resistant clones following treatment with ulixertinib at varying concentrations and treatment times. Principal component analysis revealed clustering of resistant clones by ulixertinib treatment conditions (concentrations and duration). Differences between parental A375 and ulixertinib resistant clones were revealed, including components of MAPK, HER2, and autophagy markers.<br \/>This work begins to tease out potential mechanisms of resistance to ulixertinib and guide potential combination partners that could circumvent acquired resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e5aef1d0-be90-48a4-820a-f9dccd323066\/@x03B8ZEn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,Resistance,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20547"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Deborah Knoerzer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anupama Reddy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Sorrell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline M.
