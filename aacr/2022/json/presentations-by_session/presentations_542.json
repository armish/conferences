[{"Abstract":"Background: Synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer (SEOC) refers to simultaneously discovered endometrial and ovarian tumours on the same patient. SEOC may represent double primary (DP) tumours that arise independently on the two sites, or clonally related (CR) tumours that arise either on the endometrium or ovary and metastasized to the other site. Accurate differential diagnosis between these two scenarios can implicate on the treatment options and prognostication of SEOC. However, it is difficult to achieve as the histopathological features of DP and CR tumours are often ambiguous. DNA methylation landscape of SEOC may provide markers for differentiating DP and CR tumours but remain largely unexplored.<br \/>Methods: The archival tissues of six pairs of SEOC and their accompanied normal uterine tissues were retrieved. The tumours were accessed by conventional histopathological criteria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing to categorize them into DP or CR. We then analyzed the methylation profiles of &#62;850,000 CpG sites of the tumor samples using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Downstream methylation analysis was performed in the R\/Bioconductor package ChAMP. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the methylation driven genes was done using PANTHER.<br \/>Results: mtDNA sequencing revealed that among the 6 cases of SEOC, there are 3 DP and 3 CR. Clustering analysis of differentially methylated CpGs (DMPs) between tumours of the same tissue type effectively distinguished endometrial and ovarian tumours into DP or CR. Thus, DP and CR endometrial tumour showed 50 DMPs and 15 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), but no significantly enriched signaling pathway was identified. On the other hand, there were 1,105 DMPs and 44 DMRs that mapped to 601 known genes between DP and CR ovarian tumours. GO analysis revealed that the hypomethylated genes in CR ovarian tumour were enriched in several metastatic-related processes, including cellular response to stimulus, regulation of cell projection organisation, cell migration and negative regulation of voltage-gated potassium channel activity.<br \/>Conclusions: Taken together, our findings demonstrated that DNA methylation profiling can be used for SEOC patient stratification and may enhance our understanding of epigenetic regulation of SEOC pathogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fe2db560-b6d1-49eb-89e9-1b7b77764ef6\/@A03B8ZSw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer,Metastatic potential,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17824"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yusanne Yung Sing Chan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oscar Gee Wan Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annie Nga Yin Cheung<\/i><\/presenter>.

Histone H3K4 methyltransferase, known as KMT2A, has been implicated in regulation of chromosome segregation, mitosis and DNA replication in pediatric leukemia and myeloma. However, the role of KMT2A expression in solid tumors is under-investigated. Here we examine the implications of KMT2A overexpression in prognosis, gene pathway enrichment, aneuploidy and immune infiltration patterns using a large, real-world clinical HCC dataset.<br \/>Methods: A total of 403 HCC samples underwent comprehensive molecular profiling at Caris Life Sciences, including DNA-(592 Gene Panel, NextSeq, or whole exome sequencing, NovaSeq) and RNA- (NovaSeq, whole transcriptome sequencing, WTS) sequencing. Wilcoxon, Fisher&#8217;s exact test were used to determine statistical significance (p value without and q value with multi comparison correction). Aneuploidy scores were generated from CNVkit. Apoptotic index (AI), GSEA were assessed using mRNA levels (FDR&#60;0.25 as cutoff). Overall survival was calculated from date of tissue collection to date of last contact from insurance claims data and used for Kaplan-Meier method.<br \/>Results: Overexpression of KMT2A predicts poor survival in patients with HCC (HR 2.6, 95% CI [1.4 - 5.2], p&#60;.01). KMT2A<sup>high<\/sup> HCC has higher TP53 (57.9% vs 28.8%, p&#60;.001) and lower CTNNB1 (14.1% vs 34.6%, p &#60;.01) mutation rates (mt). GSEA analysis showed that pathways such as mitotic spindle (NES = 2.1), DNA repair (NES = 2.0), E2F regulation (NES = 2.0) and MYC (NES = 1.9) are significantly enriched in KMT2A<sup>high<\/sup> HCC. Interestingly, in KMT2A<sup>high<\/sup> HCC, TP53 mutation status is a stratification factor for several HCC features: <b>1)<\/b> TP53 mt HCC displayed significantly lower aneuploidy score (median 6 vs 13.5, p&#60;.01) and higher apoptotic index (median 1.1 vs 1.2, p&#60;.05); <b>2)<\/b> inflammatory response pathways (NES = 2.1) and IL6 JAK STAT3 signaling (NES = 2.1) are specifically enriched in TP53 mt HCC and <b>3)<\/b> TP53 mt HCC has more infiltration of B cells (5.3% vs 3.3%, q&#60;.05), Macrophage M1 (6.4% vs 2.9%, q&#60;.01), CD8 + T cells and myeloid dendritic cells (1.1% vs 1%, q&#60;.01) while TP53 wt is associated with more infiltration of Macrophage M2 (5.5% vs 3.3%, q&#60;.05) cells.<br \/>Conclusions: KMT2A could act as an independent prognostic marker in HCC. The negative correlation between KMT2A expression and aneuploidy scores in TP53 mt indicates potential roles of KMT2A in maintaining genome stability. Furthermore, our results suggest TP53 status is an important stratification factor for HCC with KMT2A overexpression. Our results warrant further investigation on the impact of KMT2A level on immune modulation and may define a subset of HCC that responds most effectively to immune checkpoint inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7260e994-61c2-476d-9451-9174b72439e3\/@A03B8ZSw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Epigenetics,TP53,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17825"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liang Sha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Yin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sungming Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woojin An<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Farrell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanne Xiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Spetzler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuanzeng Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dave S.

BRD4 is one of the leaders for epigenetic regulation and is known to regulate the expression of oncogenes such as <i>c-MYC, BCL-2<\/i>, and <i>CDK4<\/i>. In a previous study, we evaluated the efficacy of iBET-151 in a large panel of GC cell lines and xenograft mouse models. We found that iBET-151 showed a modest growth-inhibitory effect in GC cells. Recent report showed, lowering the expression of BCL-2 and BCL-xL, which are the targets of BRD4, induces sensitivity to paclitaxel, frequently used antimitotic agent in GC. Therefore, we evaluate iBET-151 plus paclitaxel as a new combination treatment regimen for GC. The synergistic effect and possible mechanisms of iBET-151 with paclitaxel were evaluated in 49 GC cell lines or 10 GC organoids using cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry, western blotting, colony formation, and migration assays. We found that the addition of iBET-151 increased the sensitivity to paclitaxel alone treatment from 15% to 50% in approximately 70% (34\/49) of GC cells. iBET-151 plus paclitaxel significantly promoted cell-cycle arrest at G1 or G2\/M phase and increased sub-G1 phase and cleaved PARP expression, which correlates to increased cell death. Also, combined treatment suppressed c-Myc, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL expression in AGS, YCC-1, YCC-32, and YCC-34. We found BET proteins were overexpressed in most patient-derived GC organoids whereas c-Myc, BCL-2, and BCL-xL were expressed at variable levels. We observed that there was a synergistic growth inhibition in 6 out of 10 (60%) organoids. The data suggests iBET-151 and paclitaxel have a synergistic effect not only in GC cell lines but also in GC organoids. In summary, our data show the combination of iBET-151 and paclitaxel resulted in markedly higher anti-tumor effects compared with either treatment alone for GC. With further studies to validate the efficacy and biomarker explorations, the combination of iBET-151 and paclitaxel represents a promising therapeutic strategy in GC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b17438a-ee3c-477c-b63b-e3646890a751\/@A03B8ZSw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Epigenetic regulation,Combination,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17826"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sun Kyoung Kang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Woo Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woo Sun Kwon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Soo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Cheol Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Young Rha<\/i><\/presenter>.

Hippo pathway is well reported to be dysregulated in multiple cancer types and plays important oncogenic roles in human cancers. In mammalian cells, YAP is regulated by a phosphorylated cascade mediated by the kinases MST1\/2 and LATS1\/2, known as the canonical Hippo pathway. These upstream kinases phosphorylate YAP\/TAZ and leads to its cytosolic degradation. Perturbation of the Hippo pathway leads to YAP intranuclear translocation and downstream activation of target genes, inducing proliferative signals and thus initiating oncogenesis. Novel mechanism linking the hippo pathway to various oncogenic mechanisms are rapidly discovered and reported, further establishing the significance of this pathway and its role in cancer biology. Breast cancer is the top leading cause of cancer in women and poses a significant morbidity and economic burden on society. Hormone positive (defined as positivity of the estrogen receptor ER and\/or the progesterone receptor PR) breast cancer composes 70% of breast cancer. Endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and more recently, CDK4\/6 inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors are currently approved strategies towards breast cancer. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been FDA approved for several hematological cancers, and recently have shown inconsistent results in clinical trials for breast cancer. In our study, we demonstrate and characterize a link between HDAC inhibition and the Hippo pathway. We discover that HDAC inhibitors suppress YAP expression both transcriptionally and translationally. Paradoxically, we demonstrate that although YAP is downregulated, TEAD mediated transcription of downstream Hippo targets is activated. Mechanistically, HDAC inhibition leads to upregulation of the AP-1 transcriptional machinery that cooperates with TEAD to facilitate transcription. By RNA-seq, chromatin studies and CRISPR knockout studies, we confirm that HDAC inhibition have the ability to activate downstream of Hippo pathway, suggesting a possible mechanism for breast cancer resistance towards HDAC inhibitor. Co-targeting HDAC inhibition and AP-1 results in enhanced efficacy of HDAC inhibitors and may be a promising approach for development towards breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hippo pathway,HDAC inhibitor,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17827"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ting-Yi Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Ru Tseng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naikuan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ta-Chung Chao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chun-Yu Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ling-Ming Tseng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jiun-I Lai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Epigenetics may contribute to forming cancer-specific glycosylation by regulating the expression of glycogenes. Although comprehensive analysis of epigenetics is routinely performed, comprehensive glycan analysis, especially using human clinical samples, has been limited due to technical underdevelopment. Our aims are to understand the significance of glycosylation and its epigenetic regulation on renal carcinogenesis and to identify cancer-specific glycosylation as a potential diagnostic marker and a novel therapeutic target.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> Comprehensive glycomics and methylome analysis were performed by lectin microarray and Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip on 50 non-cancerous renal cortex tissue (N) and 50 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (T) microdissected from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Compared to N samples, T samples showed higher fluorescence intensity for lectins recognizing mannose-type glycans, and lower intensity for lectins recognizing sialyl and fucosyl groups. In RCC, the metabolism of N-glycans may remain in an immature state. By hierarchical clustering using lectin microarray data, T samples were divided into Clusters A and B with significant differences in patients&#8217; outcome. Increased high-mannose type N-glycan and core fucosylation and decreased sialylation were observed in T samples of Cluster A. According to these results, glycosylation profiles showed heterogeneity associated with patients&#8217; outcome among RCCs, and immature N-glycan may be specific in some RCCs. Methylome analysis suggests that specific glycosylation profiles of RCCs may be induced by DNA methylation alteration on glycogenes. Association between DNA methylation and mRNA expression was confirmed on some glycogenes using real-time reverse transcription PCR. As a result of examining whether the signal intensity pattern of each lectin reflects the prognosis of clear cell RCC, we could identify the lectins that reflect the RCCs prognosis.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In RCC, the metabolism of N-glycans may remain in an immature state. The glycan profiles show heterogeneity among individual RCCs, and some of the specific glycan profiles may be associated with patients&#8217; outcome.

As a means of improving the treatment of NASH-related HCCs based on early detection, this study investigated the feasibility of carcinogenic risk estimation in patients with NASH.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Normal liver tissue (NLT), non-cancerous liver tissue (N) showing histological findings compatible with non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) from patients without HCC (NAFL-O), N showing NASH from patients without HCC (NASH-O), N showing NAFL from patients with HCC (NAFL-W), N showing NASH from patients with HCC (NASH-W) and NASH-related HCC (T) were analyzed. An initial cohort of 171 tissue samples and a validation cohort of 55 tissue samples (226 samples in total) were used. Genome-wide DNA methylation screening using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and DNA methylation quantification using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a newly developed anion-exchange column were performed. Based on the Infinium assay, 4,050 CpG sites showed significant alterations of DNA methylation in 22 NASH-W samples relative to 36 NLT samples in the initial cohort, indicating that DNA methylation alterations had occurred in the NASH-W samples. On 3,234 of the 4,050 CpG sites, DNA methylation alterations in NASH-W samples relative to NLT samples were inherited by or strengthened in 22 T samples (Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test). Among the 3,234 CpG sites, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 415 CpG sites discriminating NASH-W from NLT samples with area under the curve values of more than 0.95. Among the 415 CpG sites, we focused on 21 CpG sites showing more than 85% specificity, even for discrimination of NASH-W from 91 NASH-O samples. The DNA methylation status of these 21 CpG sites was able to predict the coincidence of HCC independently from histopathological findings such as ballooning and fibrosis stage (Brunt classification). The methylation status of 5 candidate marker CpG sites was assessed using a HPLC-based system, which will be easily introduced into clinical laboratories, and for 3 of them sufficient sensitivity and specificity was successfully validated in the validation cohort. By combining these 3 CpG sites including the <i>ZC3H3 <\/i>gene, of which expression alternation may affect the post-transcriptional regulation of various tumor-related genes, 10 NAFL-W and 11 NASH-W samples from which HCCs had already arisen were confirmed to show carcinogenic risk with 95% sensitivity in the validation cohort.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>After a further prospective validation study using a larger cohort, carcinogenic risk estimation in liver biopsy specimens of patients with NASH may become clinically applicable using this HPLC-based system for quantification of DNA methylation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9821edad-1678-4b95-ad09-c71514e554e2\/@A03B8ZSw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Cancer risk,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18759"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Junko Kuramoto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eri Arai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mao Fujimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuriko Yamada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takuya Yotani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satomi Makiuchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noboru Tsuda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hidenori Ojima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moto Fukai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yosuke Seki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazunori Kasama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nobuaki Funahashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haruhide Udagawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takao Nammo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuki Yasuda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akinobu Taketomi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatsuya Kanto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yae Kanai<\/i><\/presenter>.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase genes (IDH1\/2) are non-redundantly mutated in several types of cancers including Glioblastoma (GBM), and their mutation induces a DNA hypermethylation phenotype. Radiotherapy (RT), either alone or in combination with other treatments, forms a primary intervention for GBM but the full scope of how IDH1\/2 mutations influence this response are not known. In this work, we demonstrate that IDH2 mutation reduces the formation of post-RT micronuclei (MN), small DNA bodies in the cytoplasm distinct from the primary nucleus. Previously, MN has been found to recruit the pattern recognition receptor cGAS to activate an interferon-mediated signalling cascade via STING. We demonstrate that hypermethylation induced by IDH2 mutation does not impact cGAS localization to MN but instead reduces the overall burden of MN which correlates with decreased cGAS-STING mediated transcriptional activation. Mechanistically, IDH2 mutation drives centromeric hypermethylation which stabilizes kinetochore assembly and the fidelity of mitotic chromosome segregation post radiation. We also demonstrate that a reduction of MN formation in IDH2 mutant tumors reduces synergy between RT and immune checkpoint blockade in murine glioma models. Together our data suggest that metabolic alterations in cancers directly influence mitotic fidelity and response to RT with important implications for combination treatments that capitalize on synergy with the innate cellular signalling toward the adaptive immune system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79b6a3a6-ff4b-4a26-a491-cdf2ea6f0389\/@A03B8ZSw\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,DNA methylation,Inflammation,Radioimmunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18760"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara Mahmoud Elkashef<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shirony Nicholson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shane Harding<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, it is recognized that there are racial differences in genetic architectures such as allele frequencies and linkage equilibrium patterns, which may differentially influence DNA methylation levels. This points to a critical need to conduct a methylome wide association study (MWAS) to identify meQTLs across multiethnic populations including understudied African Americans (AAs), Latinos, Japanese Americans (JAs), and Native Hawaiians (NHs).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We are performing a GWAS to identify meQTLs in blood leukocytes in a multiethnic population using data from the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). In MEC, &#8220;genome-wide&#8221; germline genetic variants and DNA methylation levels of blood leukocytes have been measured using the Illumina 1M and MethEPIC array, respectively, for 372 AAs, 408 Latinos, 531 JAs, 319 NHs, and 406 European Americans who were current smokers at time of blood draw. Genotyped data has been imputed with 1000 Genomes phase 3 dataset. For DNA methylation data, standardized quality control (QC) and normalization have been performed. We adjusted for the following potential confounders at time of blood draw: age, sex, body mass index, estimated cell type composition variables, genetic principal components, smoking pack-years, and urinary total nicotine equivalents (a biomarker for internal smoking dose). A stringent Bonferroni-corrected threshold (<i>P<\/i>&#60;5&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>\/(850,355&#215;6) = 9.80&#215;10<sup>-15<\/sup>) was used to define statistical significance. An independent dataset of MEC participants including 114 AAs, 142 Latinos, 286 JAs, 108 NHs, and 270 European Americans will be used to replicate the identified meQTLs.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our preliminary analyses for identifying cis-meQTL SNPs (residing within 1&#8201;Mb upstream or downstream of a CpG site of interest) found 169,823 CpG sites (20.0%) are associated with at least one nearby genetic variant in AAs. Similarly, 284,371 CpG sites (33.4%) in JAs, 168,580 CpG sites (19.8%) in Latinos, 123,032 CpG sites (14.5%) in NHs, and 234,822 CpG sites (27.6%) in European Americans are significantly associated with at least one nearby genetic variant. In the pan-ethnic analyses including all five ethnic\/racial groups, 193,743 CpG sites (23.0%) are associated with at least one nearby genetic variant.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our preliminary findings identified ethnic-specific and pan-ethnic cis-meQTL SNPs across a multiethnic population that includes understudied AAs, Latinos, JAs, NHs, along with European Americans.

BC is heterogeneous cancer with different molecular subtypes defined by hormone-receptor status, and the prognoses of BC patients differ by their menopausal status in conjunction with their molecular subtypes. Epigenetic dysregulation patterns can serve as principal predictors of BC progression and mortality by capturing these differences in biology that are linked to BC outcomes, leading to personalized treatment plans. In this study, we aimed to detect subtype- or menopausal-specific DNA methylation (DNAm) in BC tumor tissues across the genome that are associated with BC progression or all-cause mortality.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Associations between site-specific DNAm in tumor and BC survival were evaluated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array data from the Cancer Genome Atlas participants. Cox proportional hazards models were used in the strata by tumor subtypes and menopausal status, adjusting for age, race, cancer stage, tumor purity, and cell type proportion. Detected site-specific DNAm was further analyzed to identify subtype- or menopausal-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and functional pathways. The validation of the results was carried out on an independent dataset.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified eight CpG probes that were associated with survival outcomes in subtype- or menopausal-specific manner. Seven probes among women with luminal A subtype were associated with all-cause mortality or progression-free interval (PFI); four probes among women with luminal B were associated with PFI; and five probes among post-menopausal women were associated with PFI. Of them, six probes presented a lower risk of all-cause mortality or BC progression with higher DNAm. The identified DMRs differed by tumor subtype and menopausal status, and a majority of DMRs were driven by several weaker associations in the same direction among proximal loci. Also, we identified subtype- or menopausal-specific functional genomic pathways. Particularly, a pathway of insulin regulation was associated with all-cause mortality and PFI among pre-menopausal women. The detected site-specific probes were validated with consistent directions and magnitudes of effects on prognosis across two independent datasets.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: We identified subtype- or menopausal-specific DNAm in BC tumor tissues, DMRs, and functional pathways in association with all-cause mortality or BC progression. Our findings warrant future studies with larger independent datasets for replication and functional implications of detected DNAm.

In the largest cohort of prostate cancer brain metastases (PCBM) yet studied, we investigated the DNA methylation landscape of PCBM.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>Using Illumina EPIC arrays, we profiled the DNA methylation landscapes of 95 metastatic samples from 42 patients, with multi-regional analysis of the metastases from 31 patients. We compared DNA methylation profiles from metastases to the primary prostate cancer (PCa) samples of 18 of these patients. Multi-regional data was obtained for 15 of these. We performed unsupervised analyses of DNA methylation profiles across sample types, and identified differentially methylated CpG sites and regions (DMRs) between PCBM and PCa samples, and PCBM\/PCa samples and normal prostate tissue. We integrated our data with targeted-RNA sequencing and whole exome sequencing (WES).<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>We highlight the epigenetic heterogeneity present in different regions of the PCBM from patients for which multi-regional data were available. While substantial DNA methylation changes were detected in PCa compared to normal prostate tissue, epigenetic dysregulation was strikingly more pronounced in PCBM samples. DNA methylation changes in PCBM involved striking hypermethylation particularly enriched at CpG islands, and associated with activity of the PRC2 complex. We observed a marked distinction of the methylation profiles of <i>SPOP <\/i>mutant and <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> samples. <i>SPOP <\/i>mutant samples acquired substantially more epigenetic aberrations, particularly enriched at CpG islands which were hypermethylated genome-wide compared to <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> PCBM samples, as well as <i>SPOP <\/i>mutant PCa samples.

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been widely described in nearly all human cancers, yet their interplay with DNA mutations in lung cancer is not well understood. Incorporating the contribution of epigenetic modifications to cancer evolution trajectories within TRACERx could improve our understanding of the intricate relationship between genetic and epigenetic changes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) evolution.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Multi-region sampling from 38 TRACERx patients including 112 tumor regions and 37 matched normal adjacent tissue samples was performed. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed to assess DNA methylation and the CAMDAC (Larose-Cadieux et al, 2020) was applied to estimate purified tumor methylation rates and correct for copy number changes. Whole exome sequencing and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) were inferred using the ASCAT tool (Van Loo et al, 2010) and Methsig (Pan et al, 2021) was performed to discover new methylation driver genes.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Using multi-region sequencing, we identified ubiquitous hypermethylation of 29 known driver genes in both lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC), together with an additional 9 and 27 genes exclusive to LUSC and LUAD, respectively. We also identified 13 and 7 driver genes non-ubiquitously hypermethylated exclusively in LUSC and LUAD, respectively. Using a differential methylation based approach, we describe a method to determine the extent of intra-tumor methylation heterogeneity akin to established ITH scores based on genomics data. In addition, we report the identification of novel subtype-specific methylation driver genes enriched in HOX family members which are related to cancer progression. Through integration of DNA methylation and genomic sequencing data, we identify parallel mechanisms contributing towards ubiquitous tumor suppressor gene alterations. At the patient level, multiple driver genes such as <i>NSD1<\/i>, GATA3 and <i>MGA<\/i> were subject to repression by both copy number loss and DNA hypermethylation. Finally, we describe dosage-compensation of genes such as the Notch ligands <i>JAG2<\/i> and <i>DLK1<\/i> that are proximal to amplified oncogenes and hypermethylated during tumor evolution.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We describe the contribution of DNA methylation and genomic alterations to altering the landscape of NSCLC. Leveraging DNA methylation, we can determine the extent of convergent repression mechanisms in different regions of the same tumor, assess DNA methylation heterogeneity, and discover DNA methylation-based driver genes in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/93cbc3ac-2295-4e43-a7c9-1beab540244a\/@B03B8ZSx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Epigenetics,Heterogeneity,Tumor suppressor gene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18766"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Francisco Gimeno-Valiente<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carla Castignani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Larose-Cadieux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kezhong Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nana Mensah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Chervova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Watkins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pawan Dhami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heli Vaikkinen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Feber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>TRACERx Consortium<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Demeulemeester<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miljana Tanic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephan Beck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Van Loo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Swanton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nnennaya Kanu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) has been reported in several malignancies, including PC and have been considered as seeds for cancer initiating cells. However, the molecular mechanism governing the maintenance of CSC traits and their self-renewal remain unclear. Upregulated expression of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), which demethylates N<sup>6<\/sup>-methyladenosine (the most prevalent eukaryotic RNA modification), has been associated with cancer progression of various types. Nevertheless, our current understanding on the role of FTO in modulating biological processes relevant to PC is in infancy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this study, we first analyzed and compared the FTO expression in various PC cells vs normal pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells. We then depleted FTO in PC cells using lentiviral-mediated and pharmacological inhibitor (CS1) approaches and analyzed the effects on cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, CSC growth and self-renewal, and xenograft tumor formation.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We found that PC cells expressed markedly higher mRNA and protein levels of FTO compared to HPDE cells. FTO depleted PC cells showed impaired growth in both the solid and semi-solid medium, and also a G1 phase cell cycle arrest which correlated with the increment in the expression of CDK inhibitors: p21<sup>cip1<\/sup> and p27<sup>kip1<\/sup>. FTO loss in the PC cells also led to an increase in early apoptotic cell population with a concomitant increase in the expression of caspase 3 and 9. Of note, FTO depleted PC cells displayed marked delay in the wound closure and reduced capabilities to invade through matrigel. This further corroborated with the enhanced expression levels of epithelial (E-cadherin) and decrease in the mesenchymal (N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin) markers. Mechanistically, MET in FTO depleted cells correlated with impaired tumor sphere formation and reduced expression of markers of cancer stemness (CD44, NanoG, Sox2, ALDH1, and CD133). Replating of single cell derived from these spheroids revealed that FTO loss hampered the secondary spheres formation; thus, FTO is necessary for spheroid formation, their maintenance and self-renewal potential of CSC. Additionally, FTO loss in PC cells led to delayed as well as decreased tumor growth in nude mice. Tumor extracts from FTO-depleted xenografts displayed induction of apoptosis, decreased expression of proliferation marker Ki67, and a MET phenotype.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Through a comprehensive mechanistic analysis we explicitly demonstrate the biological and functional significance of FTO in governing PC tumorigenesis and maintenance of CSC; thus, targeting FTO may represent an attractive therapeutic approach for PC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e4ae4d01-b99e-412a-8b87-c4898e2a79b0\/@B03B8ZSx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Post-transcriptional regulation,Pancreatic cancer,Cancer stem cells,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18767"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachana Garg<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laleh Melstorm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianjun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chuan He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Goel<\/i><\/presenter>.

Defective DNA repair is a hallmark of cancer etiology, and BAZ1A is one of the deregulated proteins in colorectal cancer. The <i>BAZ1A<\/i> transcript exhibits full-length and truncated forms, generated via alternative splicing of exon-13. We observed that the histone deacetylase inhibitor sulforaphane (SFN) modulated alternative splicing of <i>BAZ1A <\/i>in human colon cancer cells by increasing the relative expression of the short <i>vs.<\/i> the long transcript. Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Regulator 2 (CCAR2) and Zinc finger protein 326 (ZIRD) are components of the DBIRD complex that integrates alternative splicing and the rate of transcript elongation (2). Knockdown of DBIRD members, including <i>ZIRD<\/i> and splicing factor <i>hnRNPA1<\/i>, downregulated expression of <i>BAZ1A <\/i>long form, whereas the <i>BAZ1A <\/i>short form was unaltered. Previous studies in SFN-treated colon cancer cells revealed that the BAZ1A bromodomain recognized a novel K97 acetylation site in CCAR2 (3). Co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that CCAR2 and BAZ1A interacted with each other in the presence and absence of SFN. On investigating the involvement of CCAR2 in <i>BAZ1A <\/i>alternative splicing, SFN treatment increased the expression of both <i>BAZ1A<\/i> long and short forms in CCAR2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> HCT116 colon cancer cells. Although the total expression of <i>BAZ1A<\/i> was influenced by CCAR2 loss, alternative splicing of <i>BAZ1A<\/i> was independent of DBIRD complex-mediated regulation. Pursuing the role of p53 and p21 in <i>BAZ1A<\/i> alternative splicing, SFN treatment increased the expression of <i>BAZ1A <\/i>short form in p21<sup>-<\/sup><sup>\/<\/sup><sup>-<\/sup> HCT116 cells, whereas this was impaired in p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> HCT116 cells. Overall, this investigation provided mechanistic insights into the regulation of alternative splicing in SFN-treated colon cancer cells, and <i>BAZ1A<\/i> functionalities that might be targeted via next-generation combinatorial epigenetic agents (4).

Mutations in the mammalian Switch \/ Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI\/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex have been identified in approximately 20% of all human cancers and more than 40% of CCA. If the role of SWI\/SNF on the tumor biology and microenvironment is being uncovered in other tumor types, it remains vastly unknown in CCA. Here, we wanted to investigate, using clinical samples, the association between SWI\/SNF defects, the molecular landscape and tumor immune microenvironment in CCA.<br \/>Material and Methods: Mutation profiling of 103 patients with CCA from Gustave Roussy (GR) was assessed with FoundationOne&#174; CDx 324-gene NGS panel. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 11 patients with CCA were analyzed for SWI\/SNF (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCB1 and SMARCA4) and Polycomb-DUB (BAP1) subunits, as well as lymphocytic markers (CD4 and CD8). Stainings were performed using a VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA. Absolute count of positive cells per mm<sup>2<\/sup> was determined by digital image analysis with the Definiens Developer XD&#8482; by selecting at least 5 independent tumoral zones. Pairwise comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney test.<br \/>Results: Among the patients for whom NGS data was available, the most frequently altered genes were <i>TP53<\/i> (27%), <i>CDKN2A<\/i> (17%), <i>KRAS<\/i> (16%), <i>ARID1A<\/i> (12%), <i>FGFR2<\/i> (12%) and <i>PBRM1<\/i> (10%). Subunits of the SWI\/SNF complex and <i>BAP1<\/i> were mutated in 25% and 10% of cases, respectively. Tumor samples with <i>ARID1A<\/i> mutations (n=5) showed strongly decreased ARID1A expression compared to WT tumor samples (n=2) (mean = 308.03 positive nuclei (p.n)\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> versus 6096.82 p.n \/mm<sup>2<\/sup> respectively; P&#60;0.0001) but unchanged PBRM1, SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 expression. <i> <\/i><i>PBRM1<\/i> mutations (n=4) were associated with decreased expression of PBRM1 (mean = 309.6 p.n \/mm<sup>2<\/sup> versus 4980.2 p.n \/mm<sup>2<\/sup> in WT samples; P&#60;0.0001) and ARID1A (mean=1196.15 p.n \/mm<sup>2<\/sup>; P&#60;0.001), but unchanged SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 expression. <i>BAP1<\/i> mutations (n=3) were also associated with decreased BAP1 and ARID1A expression (ARID1A mean = 457.70 p.n\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>; P&#60;0.001). <i>ARID1A<\/i> and <i>PBRM1<\/i>-altered tumor samples showed a poorly infiltrated microenvironment, with decreased CD4+ T cell (159.48 positive cells (p.c)\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> and 188.66 p.c\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> respectively versus 1126.52 p.c\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> for WT; P&#60;0.0001) and CD8+ T cell density (72.38 and 76.54 p.c\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> versus 548.58 p.c\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> for WT; P&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion:<b><u> <\/u><\/b>Mutations in the ARID1A and PBRM1 subunits of the SWI\/SNF complex are associated with a loss of protein expression. In contrast to what reported in other tumor types, <i>ARID1A <\/i>and <i>PBRM1<\/i> mutations correlated with poorly lymphocytic TIME in CCA. Decreased PBRM1 expression is further associated with decreased ARID1A expression. Independent revalidation and further study in larger tumor series are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2620122b-f9de-4a77-a817-fa782b480509\/@B03B8ZSx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,Molecular profiling,Immunohistochemistry,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18770"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Clémence Astier<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Yves Scoazec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virginie Marty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Bawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Signolle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carine Ngo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Facchinetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Hollebecque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Postel-Vinay<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although molecular subtypes of SCLC based on the expression of lineage transcription factors such as ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3 and YAP1 have been identified and explored recently, LCNEC has not been well characterized so far, and in clinic, patients with LCNEC have been treated with both chemotherapy regimens for SCLC and regimens for non-small cell lung cancer. To make efficient treatment strategies for LCNEC, further advances in molecular characterization of LCNEC are warranted. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to elucidate the heterogeneity of neuroendocrine differentiation in lung cancer with LCNEC components by using epigenomic profiling. We investigated super-enhancer profiles of 24 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from patients with primary lung cancer containing LCNEC components. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these specimens using H3K27 acetylation signals over super-enhancer regions near transcriptional regulators identified four distinct clusters. Principal component analysis supported this classification. Immunohistochemical staining for ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3 and YAP1 on these tissues was also performed and the staining results were compatible with our epigenomic profiling. Cluster 1 tissues were positive for ASCL1 and NKX2-1 while the high expression of POU2F3 or YAP1 was found in some samples among Cluster 3 and Cluster 4. None of the four transcription factors were positive in Cluster 2. Additional genomic profiling revealed no clear associations between the clusters and genetic alterations such as <i>RB1<\/i> loss and <i>STK11<\/i> loss. Neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin, chromogranin A and CD56 were found to be more commonly positive in tissues among Cluster 1. These findings suggest the existence of the distinct differentiation subtypes of lung cancer with LCNEC components, different from the previously reported classifications, which provides new insight into the regulation of neuroendocrine differentiation in lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4a9c3260-3d78-4815-b042-d36c4bb2a529\/@B03B8ZSx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine differentiation,Histone acetylation,Transcription factor,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18771"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Takashi Sato<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junko Hamamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katsura Emoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takahiro Fukushima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Sugihara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masayuki Shirasawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshiro Nakahara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Igawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshiki Murakumo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Kohno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kouya Shiraishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroyuki Yasuda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenzo Soejima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideo Watanabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katsuhiko Naoki<\/i><\/presenter>.

Epigenetic mutations to H3K27M are seen in up to 81% of patients, resulting in the global loss of the repressive H3K27 trimethylation marker, increasing chromatin accessibility and deregulating gene expression. However, these epigenetic changes are often partnered by secondary mutations, with activating mutations and copy number gains observed in a wide variety of RTK genes and their associated signaling pathways. The combination of these two mutational paradigms results in the broad alteration of cellular and metabolic mechanisms, complicating the search for effective targeted therapeutic strategies. Copper, a metal ion essential for normal cellular function is known to be highly expressed in the pons, and influence ERK and PI3K\/AKT signaling. Importantly, excess copper accumulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological diseases and cancers. Copper chelation therapy is a clinically approved strategy for pediatric patients with Wilson&#8217;s Disease, known to improve their neurological symptoms, and is under investigation for use in a number of cancers. Therefore, we hypothesized copper chelation may be an effective therapeutic strategy for DIPG. Cytotoxicity assays using copper chelator tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) demonstrated millimolar efficacy and synergized with mTOR inhibitor everolimus in a panel of DIPG cell lines, with H3-K27M mutant cell lines found to be more sensitive. Western blots were used to identify copper integrated pathways, with DIPG cell lines stimulated with sub-lethal copper concentrations demonstrating increased phosphorylated expression of ERK1\/2, ERK5, AKT and p70SK61. TEPA reduced the phosphorylation of these markers compared to controls. Importantly, epigenetic mechanisms were sensitive to copper, as both copper stimulation and TEPA modulated H3K27 trimethylation, and TEPA decreased pro-expression H3K27 acetylation. In further blots examining epigenetic regulators, TEPA reduced the expression of EZH2, DNMT3B and DNMT1. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed TEPA downregulated genes involved in S-adenosylmethionine production metabolism, DNA regulation, cell cycle and mTORC signaling and specifically, EZH2, DNMT3B and DNMT1 expression. <i>In vivo<\/i> investigations demonstrated TEPA&#8217;s ability to improve survival in an orthotopic xenograft model, and via xenogen luminescence imaging complete tumor regression in 25% of treated mice. This study indicates copper directly impacts epigenetic and RTK mechanisms, and that their targeting through copper chelation agents represents a potential therapeutic strategy for DIPG, both as a single agent and in combination. <b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/624c8792-d865-4d29-b9d3-10cdb00b164b\/@B03B8ZSx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Copper,Receptor Tyrosine Kinase,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18772"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"e3131bff-3060-4ead-a71b-0df95872b571","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e3131bff-3060-4ead-a71b-0df95872b571\/@B03B8ZSx\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Filip Michniewicz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Saletta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tayla Watkinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniele Mercatelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federico M.

Although, 5-flurouracil (5FU) based chemotherapy and surgical resection are considered most effective treatments for CRC patients, the 5-year survival rates remain poor primarily due to distant metastasis, local recurrence and acquired drug resistance. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), an RNA N<sup>6<\/sup>-methyladenosine demethylase, has recently been reported to be upregulated in various cancers, including CRC. However, thus far, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of FTO in CRC and\/or acquisition of 5FU resistance remains unclear.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To study the relevance of FTO overexpression in CRC, we adopted various approaches: a) lentiviral-mediated stable depletion of FTO or (b) CS1-mediated pharmacological inhibition in CRC cells, c) lentiviral-mediated FTO overexpression in normal colonic epithelial cells (NCM460), and thereafter analyzed the effect on cell viability, cell cycle, wound healing, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stemness, 5FU drug response and tumor forming capability in nude mice. Expression of markers of cell proliferation and apoptosis in the tumor extracts were analyzed by western blotting. To augment the clinical relevance, we evaluated the effect of CS1 on the growth and response to 5FU in patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Kaplan Meier analysis was performed to correlate the significance of FTO overexpression with survival in CRC patient cohorts.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A significant upregulation of both mRNA and protein expression of FTO was found in various CRC cells compared to NCM460 cells. Notably, FTO inhibition hampered the proliferative, migratory and invasive capabilities of CRC cells whilst, ectopic overexpression of FTO in the NCM460 cells promoted oncogenic phenotype. Furthermore, FTO depletion in CRC cells led to EMT reversal, impaired tumor-sphere formation and stemness traits, which in turn was reflected in the sensitization towards 5FU in otherwise resistant cells. Moreover, xenograft tumor forming capabilities of CRC cells was severely hindered in FTO depleted cells. Besides, FTO-depleted xenografts displayed a significant decrease in the expression of markers of cell survival and proliferation (p-AKT and PCNA), while there was an increment in the apoptotic marker, Caspase 9. The relevance of our <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> findings was further strengthened as CS1-mediated inhibition not only decrease the number and size of PDO, but also sensitized them towards 5FU. In addition, we unambiguously demonstrate a significant correlation between FTO upregulation and poor overall and recurrence-free-survival of CRC patients.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our study establishes the functional importance of FTO in CRC and provides novel evidence for the potential use of FTO inhibitor as an adjunctive treatment to 5FU based chemotherapy for CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f65e134c-67c2-4b80-b112-11ec24d15eec\/@B03B8ZSx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cell,Colorectal cancer,Chemoresistance,Post-transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18773"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachana Garg<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laleh Melstorm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianjun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chuan He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Goel<\/i><\/presenter>.

The association between thyroid inflammation and carcinogenesis has long been recognized. However, the differential immunological mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) and benign thyroid nodules (BTNs) have not been well characterized. In this study, we aimed to explore the immunological differences between PTCs and BTNs. Further, we attempted to develop a novel classifier based on DNA methylation of immune response genes for thyroid cancer precise diagnosis.<br \/>Methods: A publicly available tissue Reduced Representative Bisulfite Sequencing dataset composed of 80 PTCs and 65 BTNs was collected (GSE107738), including a training cohort (39 PTCs, 28 BTNS) and a testing cohort (41 PTCs, 37 BTNs). We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between PTCs and BTNs. Functional enrichment analyses of DMR-associated genes were conducted by hypergeometric test. DNA methylation markers of immune response genes were extracted. A diagnostic classifier based on these markers was developed using a training cohort and was validated in an independent testing cohort. These markers were further confirmed by two independent datasets (GSE53051: 20 PTCs, 32 BTNs; GSE97466: 60 PTCs, 17 BTNs) generated by the Infinium Methylation 450K array. A new classifier based on the corresponding 15 array-based methylation markers was built using these two datasets, and was validated in the 450K array data of 499 thyroid malignant tissue samples in the TCGA database.<br \/>Results: We identified 220 DMRs between PTCs and BTNs. DMR-associated genes were significantly enriched in immune response biological processes. The classifier comprised of 15 DNA methylation markers from immune response genes achieved 100% sensitivity, 76% specificity, 82% positive predictive value (PPV), 100% negative predictive value (NPV) and 88% accuracy in the testing cohort. This classifier also demonstrated high accuracy for cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules (25 PTCs, 29 BTNs). Leave-one-out cross validation using the corresponding array methylation markers in two independent datasets achieved prediction accuracy of 92% and 95%, respectively. An array-based classifier trained on all samples of the methylation array data achieved a sensitivity of 89% in classifying 499 thyroid malignant tissue samples in the TCGA database.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that DNA methylation signature of immune response gene could be used to differentiate PTCs from BTNs with high accuracy, which may be caused by the different immunological microenvironments in response to PTCs and BTNs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd4baf51-f338-4c20-aa2e-63d9db5208d3\/@t03B8ZSy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Methylation,Thyroid\/endocrine-related cancers,Thyroid cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19030"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yiying Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minjie Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiye He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhixi Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Rui Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Previously, we established miR-96 targets RAR&#947; and its coactivator TACC1, which in turn impacts AR signaling associated with PCa progression. In the current study we sought to define the RAR&#947; complex, its interactions with the AR, and in turn how this controls gene expression. Increased RAR&#947; levels through miR-96 treatments increased both ENZA antiproliferative sensitivity associated with an increase in G<sub>1<\/sub> and G<sub>2<\/sub>\/M. IMPACT-seq identified miR-96 recognition elements (MREs) in HPr1AR (~1950 at 24h) and LNCaP cells (~ 350) with ~ 150 shared. In parallel, m6A-Seq revealed that the epitranscriptome mark m6A differed significantly between cells. For example, m6A was more significantly enriched on TACC1 mRNA in LNCaP compared to HPr1AR and m6A-marked MRE resulted in genes being more signficantly down-regulated by miR96, including TACC1. RIME revealed that RAR&#947; significantly interacts miR-96 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) and proteins (DEPs) including m6A regulators (METTL3) and QSER1 complex that protects against enhancer methylation. Reflecting this, restoring RAR&#947; levels in 22Rv1 cells, increased AR genomic binding 12-fold to greater than 9,500 sites and further by TACC1. These gained AR sites were enriched for GATA and Homeobox motifs, significantly overlapped with H3K27ac and super-enhancers, and also ChromHMM-defined Poised Enhancers (logPV = 163) and Transcribed regions (logPV = 179). RNA-Seq experiments revealed that RAR&#947;\/TACC1 significantly altered the frequency and fold change of DHT-regulated genes. Finally, miR-96 antagomir\/ENZA treatments drove a unique transcriptome that triggered cell cycle arrest and significantly associated with worse survival in the SU2C cohort. To summarize these data suggest that miR-96 is directed to control the RAR&#947;\/TACC1 complex in part by m6A marks. Restoring the RAR&#947;\/TACC1 complex increased association with potential bookmarking factor like QSER1 and redirects AR to active enhancers that promote ENA-regulated genes and increase propensity for cells to undergo cell arrest.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e35d1f06-7b83-43f9-be64-830ce707afc6\/@t03B8ZSy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Prostate cancer,Enzalutamide,Gene regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20552"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sajad A.

Pembrolizumab, a programmed-death-1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor is active but with a response rate as low as 19%.<br \/>Our preliminary work has identified SET and MYND Domain containing 3 (SMYD3) as a chromatin modifier that is significantly overexpressed in HPV-negative HNSCC tumor tissues compared to normal epithelium and is associated with low CD8+ T-cell infiltration in HPV-negative HNSCC.<b> <\/b>Furthermore,<b> <\/b>we have shown that<b> <\/b>knockdown of human SMYD3 upregulates the expression of multiple type I IFN response and antigen presentation machinery (APM) genes. This study aims to investigate whether Smyd3 depletion potentiates immune-mediated antitumor efficacy in anti-PD-1 resistant syngeneic mouse models of HPV-negative HNSCC (MOC1), as well as relevant mechanisms.<br \/>SiRNA-mediated knockdown of Smyd3 in mouse HPV-negative MOC1 cells followed by RNA-seq revealed upregulation of multiple type I IFN response and APM genes in vitro. Multicolor flow cytometry of MOC1 tumors treated with control anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or Smyd3 ASOs showed that Smyd3 depletion in a syngeneic, heterotopic mouse model (C57BL\/6) of flank MOC1 tumors induced intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T-cells, as well as upregulation of H2-Kb (MHC class I) and mouse Pd-l1 in MOC1 cells. Combined treatment of Smyd3 ASOs with anti-PD-1 induced complete regressions of flank MOC1 tumors in 4\/8 treated mice and significant tumor growth restriction in 2\/8 mice, while 2\/8 tumors &#8220;escaped&#8221; the treatment effect. Single-cell RNA seq of MOC1 tumors treated with control or Smyd3 ASOs is ongoing to evaluate the effects of Smyd3 depletion on MOC1 cancer cells and immune cell subsets of the tumor microenvironment and to identify potential mechanisms of resistance of Smyd3 ASO + anti-PD-1 combination treatment. Genome-wide mapping of Smyd3 and the repressive mark H4K20me3, which is known to be written by Smyd3, in MOC1 cells using CUT&#38;RUN assays is also ongoing and aims to decipher whether Smyd3 directly binds to and regulates the expression of immune-related genes through H4K20me3. Ex-vivo cytotoxicity assays aim to evaluate whether CRISPR Smyd3 KO in MOC1 cells sensitizes cancer cells to TIL-mediated cytotoxicity.<br \/>Smyd3 depletion induces an inflamed tumor microenvironment and may potentiate the immune-mediated antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 in syngeneic mouse models of HPV-negative HNSCC.

On the other hand, survival drops to 30% among patients with metastases and\/or bad response to treatment. This suggests that metastasis and resistance to treatment are key obstacles to tackle in order to reduce mortality. In this context this study has the aim to identify mechanisms that could participate in the emergence of resistance to doxorubicin, one of the most often used chemotherapeutic molecules to treat OS. For this purpose, HOS-MNNG cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of doxorubicin over a long period of time (over 6 months). Transcriptional and super-enhancer (SE) profiles of highly resistant (IC50 greater by 250 times) cells obtained as such were then compared to naive untreated cells. We hypothesized identification of target genes of resistant-specific super-enhancers, which are regulatory regions that mobilize a large proportion of the cell&#8217;s transcriptional apparatus and epigenetic regulators, would allow to unveil key genes in the emergence of resistance. We observed the presence of highly efficient super-enhancers within loci located in close proximity to genes encoding for ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters only within the high dose doxorubicin resistant cells. The associated genes were among the most highly up-regulated genes in the resistant cells and western blot analysis confirms higher concentration of encoded proteins compared to naive cells. The use of one BETi namely JQ1 - that inhibits recruitment of transcriptional co-factors on regulatory DNA regions such as enhancers and SEs - sensitizes resistant cells to doxorubicin. This suggests that the identified SEs in close proximity could play key role in the emergence of resistance. In order to track emergence of the mechanisms of resistance and to appreciate the transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity among resistant cells, we performed single cell 10x multiome (ATAC+RNA) on naive, intermediate and high dose doxorubicin resistant cells. While the high expression of genes encoding for the ABC transporters revealed in bulk analysis seemed ubiquitous among all the clusters of high-dose resistant cells, intermediate-dose resistant cells demonstrate no or very low expression for these genes. This could suggest that the first form of resistance passes through other mechanisms.<br \/>In conclusion ABC transporters could be highly involved in the emergence of resistance to high-doses of doxorubicin in OS. A heterogeneous feature could be expected in patients as resistance to intermediate doses do not seem to depend on this mechanism. Finally, the use of BETi could be suggested in patients with bad response to treatment.<br \/>This project is supported by R&#233;gion Pays de la Loire, ANR, la Ligue contre le cancer and SFCE.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c4fd97d2-84f5-47d7-bb1e-554f2590142e\/@t03B8ZSy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Osteosarcoma,Resistance,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20872"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robel A.

DNA methylation profiling on normal colon mucosa from 77 CRC patients and 68 patients without cancer (controls) of AA and Caucasian descent identified a distinct subgroup of CRC patients (11AA and 4 Caucasians) who are statistical &#8220;outliers&#8221; at a large number of CpGs. Such highly epigenetically disrupted CRC patients are termed &#8220;Outlier Methylation Phenotype&#8221; (OMP). Comparison of methylome profiles of CRC patients and controls revealed that AA CRC patients have greater disruption of the normal colon methylome than do Caucasian patients. A large fraction of the overall methylation differences found between CRC patients and controls is attributable to OMPs. Estimation of epigenetic ages shows that OMPs have lower epigenetic ages compared to their chronological ages. In other words, OMPs undergo epigenetic age deceleration. Comparison of normal colon mucosa transcription profiles of OMP cancer patients with those of non-OMP cancer patients indicates genes whose promoters are hypermethylated in the OMP patients are also transcriptionally down-regulated, and that many of the genes most affected are involved in interactions between epithelial cells, the mucus layer, and the microbiome. Analysis of 16S RDNA profiles suggests that normal colon mucosa of OMPs are enriched in bacterial genera associated with CRC risk, advanced tumor stage, chronic intestinal inflammation, malignant transformation, nosocomial infections and KRAS mutations. In conclusion, our study suggests a distinct epigenetically disrupted OMP group in CRC that are responsible for disrupted methylome, altered gene expression and microbial dysbiosis. Furthermore, a higher frequency of OMPs among African Americans (11\/42) than among Caucasians (5\/35) may contribute to observed racial disparities in CRC incidence and outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc0bd8d7-7803-4253-9c7a-62ecbdf02a3a\/@t03B8ZSy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Race,DNA methylation,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21043"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jayashri Ghosh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryant M.

We developed and applied a new approach to re-annotate the 850k data, which greatly improved the association of probes to enhancers and show that 850k targets more enhancers than RRBS. We further investigated the reproducibility of the two technologies and applied various existing normalization methods to 850k data that reduce variability between replicates and variability with other technologies. We thereby showed that normalization methods developed for 450k greatly reduced variability in 850k data to a level below that of highly variable RRBS data. We finally performed differential methylation analysis with 850k data from breast cancer samples applying our new re-annotation method and highlight that the majority of differentially methylated cytosines were detected with probes specific to the 850k mapping to enhancers, confirming the deregulation of enhancer methylation in breast cancer. In summary, our study provides a new annotation for the 850k array, which greatly increases the number of cytosines mapping to enhancers and therefore allows for the improved analysis of enhancer methylation. Overall, we conclude that the 850k array allows for detection of methylation changes in regions not covered by previous Infinium arrays and is the best choice, as compared to RRBS, for high-throughput analysis of enhancer methylation in large clinical cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c9787104-0f29-43c2-88ec-8f9246ccb7ce\/@t03B8ZSy\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Bioinformatics,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21070"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Martin Bizet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthieu Defrance<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilie Calonne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianluca Bontempi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>François Fuks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jana Jeschke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the restoration of <i>IRF6<\/i> expression in a panel of UC cell lines treated with CPH. Similar to 5azaDC, bisulphite pyrosequencing found that CPH could decrease promoter methylation of <i>IRF6<\/i> in UC cell lines.

Functional studies found that ectopic expression of <i>IRF6<\/i> suppressed UC tumor growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Clinical studies also found that high-grade UC patient tissue samples has significantly higher <i>IRF6<\/i> methylation than low-grade tumor samples.

They can be mapped on genomes thanks to their astounding enrichment for well-known enhancers markers, such as acetylation of the lysine 27 of type 3 histones (H3K27Ac). Their target genes, confined in their so-called topologically associated domains, present exceptionally high expression levels, depending on associated super enhancers activation status, and are responsible for defining cells identity whether physiological or pathological. Osteosarcomas are the most common primary malignant bone tumors. Patients suffering from osteosarcomas, on average 15 years old, mostly develop pulmonary metastasis, responsible for drastic decrease in their survival. We have conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing against H3K27Ac and RNA sequencing experiments on osteosarcoma cells presenting high propensity to metastatic dissemination or devoid of this capacity, in order to unveil genes implicated in metastasis development through super enhancers genomic mapping. We have highlighted exclusive active super enhancers profiles between metastatic and non-metastatic osteosarcoma cells. Among target genes of spotted super enhancers, three of them caught our attention. Implication of these genes in metastatic development have already been demonstrated in various cancers evolution, except in osteosarcomas. Osteosarcoma cells having high capacity for metastatic development present identified genes over expressions compared to cells incompetent in this pathological process. Artificial down expressions of identified genes decrease osteosarcoma cells metastatic capacity <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments, that correspond to paratibial implantation of modified osteosarcoma cells and analysis of primary tumor metastatic development, are currently under way.
