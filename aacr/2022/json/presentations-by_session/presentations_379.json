[{"Abstract":"Cancer immunotherapies reprogram the patient&#8217;s immune system to mount a coordinated response against a malignant target. T cells engineered to express Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) through transduction with a lentiviral vector represent an effective strategy to specifically eliminate cancerous cells from a patient. Currently, five CAR T cell therapies are approved by the FDA for the treatment of hematological malignancies. With the recent clinical and regulatory success of CAR T cell therapies, the next generation of CAR T cells are undergoing preclinical development. Labcorp Drug Development produces CAR T cells to support the development of new preclinical strategies. Here, the CAR T Cell Generation Service is demonstrated using an anti-CD19 CAR T cell as an example.<br \/>Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy, human donors as a T-cell source, CAR T cells were produced by lentivirus transduction. Flow cytometry featuring a CAR-specific monoclonal antibody was used to determine transduction efficiency. To assess <i>in vitro<\/i> activity, co-cultures of T cells and CD19-expressing NALM6 cells were used to measure cytotoxicity. Proinflammatory cytokine production was analyzed using a Meso Scale Discovery V-PLEX assay. For evaluation of <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy, a disseminated NALM6-Luc-mCh-Puro human acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia model in female NSG mice was conducted.<br \/>After T cells were treated with lentivirus, approximately 25% of total cells were CD3+\/CAR+. Greater than 95% of all target NALM6 cells were killed by a high dose of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. In contrast, only 33% of target cells were killed by untransduced (UTD) T cells at the highest concentration tested. Cytotoxicity against the negative control MV-4-11 cells was equal for a high dose of UTD and a high dose of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. When co-cultured with CD19-expressing NALM6 cells, anti-CD19 CAR T cells produced proinflammatory cytokines including IFN-&#947;. Relative to mock-treated control mice, treatment with anti-CD19 CAR T cells at high, medium, and low doses increased the time of <i>in vivo<\/i> disease progression by 175%, 125%, and 16%, respectively.<br \/>Anti-CD19 CAR T cells generated in our lab were specifically active against CD19-expressing target cells. As a premier contract research organization, Labcorp Drug Development is experienced in producing, handling and culturing T cells and CAR T cells for <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> early discovery studies. Preclinical screening of multiple CAR T cell candidates, alone or in combination with other agents, would facilitate the identification and selection of CARs with the most favorable activity profile for progression through the drug development pipeline. By providing a reliable source of CAR T cells, we are supporting early discovery studies and the development of therapeutic strategies in oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/333c6811-c560-4c34-a347-c7f35e8c792b\/@z03B8ZFN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,CAR T cells,Flow cytometry,Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16754"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew Karalewitz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Czeryba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yewei Xing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derrik Germain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Lapinski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheri Barnes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Cameron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Saims<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amber Rowse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heidi Nielsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Wise<\/i><\/presenter>.

Unfortunately, CAR-T cell therapies have several shortcomings and clinical success has primarily been limited to hematological cancers. Challenges of CAR-T cell therapy include tumor immune evasion through loss of target antigen expression by tumor cells and inhibition of CAR-T cell function by tumor expressed inhibitory molecules. Natural killer (NK) cells present an alternative to T cells that could be more effective due to their ability to perform both antigen dependent and independent killing. NK cells have demonstrated antigen specific killing when engineered to express CARs and NK cells also mediate the direct killing of transformed cells with reduced or absent MHC expression. Moreover, NK cells carry out antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ACDD) of cells bound by antibodies via the NK cell CD16A receptor. Due to the multiple modalities for cancer cell killing, there is an increased interest in NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. As NK cells are not associated with graft versus host disease, neurotoxicity, long-term autoimmunity, nor cytokine release syndrome, they are more suited for use in allogeneic settings than T cells and have significant clinical potential for use as off-the-shelf products. However, previous publications and clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of unmanipulated NK cells to treat cancer is minimally effective, likely due to limited engraftment, little <i>in<\/i> <i>vivo<\/i> expansion or persistence, and suppression by the tumor microenvironment. NK cells activated and expanded with engineered feeder cells expressing membrane bound interleukin-21 (mbIL-21) and 4-1BBL have shown promising results clinically with high-risk myeloid malignancies and preclinically in several solid tumor models. <i>Therefore, we hypothesize that activated\/expanded CAR-NK cells that have been genetically edited can be used to successfully treat osteosarcoma, a disease for which patient outcome has not improved in over forty years.<\/i> Our proposed objectives are to evaluate the baseline response of rested- and activated\/expanded-NK cells against various osteosarcoma cell lines, knockout negative regulators of NK cell function (specifically, <i>c-CBL<\/i>, <i>IL-1R8<\/i>, and <i>SMAD3<\/i>), and implement several CARs alone or in combination that optimally activate NK cell antigen-specific killing. Genetically engineered CAR-NK cells will be evaluated for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and safety in osteosarcoma models. Our preliminary data strongly supports the hypothesis that CAR-NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy can be fully realized using activated, genome engineered CAR-NK cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/51b0b5aa-ceae-4ccc-aca1-0538f587015f\/@z03B8ZFN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Osteosarcoma,Pediatric cancers,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16755"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gabrielle M.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been recently approved in the first-line setting, however only 20-30% of patients respond to the therapy and disease progression is observed in most cases. This provides strong rationale to develop new approaches to treat this unmet medical need. We designed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that targets the oncofetal antigen glypican-3 (GPC3) expressed in 70-90% of HCC and identified transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;) as a major suppressive factor that could limit the extent of CAR-T expansion and function. TGF&#946; levels are increased in advanced HCC as a result of liver fibrosis and hypoxia, which creates an immunosuppressive milieu facilitating cancer progression and poor prognosis. We tested whether the anti-tumor efficacy of a GPC3 CAR-T can be restored by abrogating this suppressive cytokine through the co-expression of dominant-negative TGF&#946;RII (TGF&#946;RIIDN).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> GPC3 CAR-T expressing TGF&#946;RIIDN showed minimal SMAD2\/3 phosphorylation upon exposure to recombinant TGF&#946; and were more resistant to TGF&#946;-mediated suppression of IL-2 and interferon gamma (IFN&#947;) production <i>in vitro<\/i>, demonstrating functional attenuation of the TGF&#946; signaling pathway. In a xenograft model of a human HCC cell line overexpressing TGF&#946;, the TGF&#946;RIIDN armored CAR-T achieved 100% tumor regression with 10\/10 complete responders (CR) while the unarmored CAR-T had 4\/10 CRs. Armoring GPC3 CAR-T with TGF&#946;RIIDN doubled disease free survival compared to unarmored CAR-T, significantly delaying tumor recurrence. In three TGF&#946;<sup>low<\/sup> patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, mice treated with unarmored and armored CAR-T achieved &#62;90% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) compared to mice treated with untransduced primary T cells. In three TGF&#946;<sup>+<\/sup> PDX models, mice treated with unarmored CAR-T achieved no significant TGI whereas mice treated with armored CAR-T achieved 60-90% TGI. The armored CAR-T cells infiltrated TGF&#946;<sup>+ <\/sup>HCC tumors more abundantly than their unarmored counterparts, expressed lower levels of immune checkpoint markers PD1 and LAG3 and higher level of the stemness marker CD27. In line with these observations, we detected significantly more IFN&#947; at peak response and decreased alpha-fetoprotein in the serum of mice treated with armored cells compared to mice receiving unarmored CAR-T, confirming <i>in vivo<\/i> functional superiority of TGF&#946;RIIDN armored CAR-T therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Armoring GPC3 CAR-T with TGF&#946;RIIDN abrogates the signaling of TGF&#946; <i>in vitro<\/i> and enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of GPC3 CAR-T against TGF&#946;-expressing HCC tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>, proving TGF&#946;RIIDN to be an effective armoring strategy against TGF&#946;-expressing solid malignancies such as HCC.

We demonstrated that CoupledCAR can significantly enhance the expansion and antitumor efficacy of PAP CAR-T cells both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Furthermore, we showed that the expansion of solid tumor-targeting CAR-T cells does not depend on CAR\/CD3&#950; stimulation through direct antigen binding with CAR but enhances the memory status of CAR-T cells and causes little exhaustion.

Integration of a transgene cassette expressing an antigen receptor into the genome enables T cells to recognize specific tumor antigens. Viral vectors and transposons can introduce transgenes into primary human T cells. However these approaches cannot control genomic location and have limited control over the copy number of cassette insertions.<br \/>Here, we used epigenetic analysis, transcriptional profiling, high-throughput gene-editing and T cell functional experiments to identify the optimal genomic locus amenable to non-viral genome targeting. First we analyzed the epigenetic landscape of primary human T cells to identify regions (&#8220;gene deserts&#8221;) that are accessible but devoid of annotated regulatory elements or coding sequences. Candidate loci were validated using CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing to directly cut and a marker gene cassette was inserted into these sites. Knock-in efficiency and transgene expression stability in primary human T cells were evaluated for all loci.<br \/>Evaluation of 40 loci demonstrated substantial variability (10 fold) in transgene expression and confirmed that not all sites were equivalent in their ability to sustain transgene expression. Next, we evaluated 8 most promising candidate loci for compatibility with complex T cell programs embodied by integrated circuits, containing a priming receptor (PrimeR) that triggers expression of a CAR in response to a priming antigen. We identified one integration site (termed &#8220;GS94&#8221;) that supported: 1) stable and high PrimeR expression; 2) high and inducible CAR expression; and 3) a superior T cell cytotoxic and cytokine secretion profile.<br \/>Finally, we assessed off-target cutting mediated by the CRISPR sgRNA targeting GS94. The sgRNA is the most specific out of the candidates evaluated with iGUIDE and targeted PCR. We were unable to detect any measurable off-target activity by targeted PCR on predicted sites. The GS94 site is a component of the integrated circuit T cell (ICT) therapy, AB-1015, which is now under development for the treatment of high-grade serous carcinoma ovarian tumors.

CAR cell technology is advancing rapidly, with ever increasing capabilities for cancer treatment both with regard to tumor types and the CAR cell used (NK, Macrophage, T). To date, the most successful application remains the treatment of B cell lymphoma using CD19-specific CAR-T cells. Here we describe how to efficiently generate and expand a CD19 CAR-T cell and validate their efficacy in <i>in-vitro<\/i> and <i>in-vivo<\/i> studies. HLA-A*02:01+ CD3+ T-cells were transduced to express a clinically tested CD19-specific CAR to &#62;80% efficiency and reproducibly expanded to &#62;68 fold over a 19-day period. After sufficient expansion, cells were validated in <i>in-vitro<\/i> studies to assess their efficacy, utilizing a HLA-A*02:01+ patient derived xenograft (PDX) CD19+ cell line, alongside human cancer cell lines RAJI (CD19+) and K562 (CD19-). Flow cytometry analysis revealed the potent ability of CD19-CAR-T cells to kill CD19+ targets in a dose-dependent fashion. Highly specific killing at all E:T ratios was observed, with negligible off target killing identified. Supportive supernatant analysis showed highly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations, identifying enhanced activation of CAR-T cells in the presence of CD19+ target cells only. After successful <i>in-vitro<\/i> batch testing for on-target killing CAR-T cells were released for <i>in-vivo<\/i> survival studies. Mice were inoculated with the same strains of CD19+ cells used during <i>in-vitro<\/i> validation to produce a tumor burdened model. CAR-T cells or non-transduced cells from the same donor were transfused and survival rates, tumor progression and tolerability assessments were observed over several weeks. Ex-vivo tissue and sera analysis further characterized these highly efficacious human CAR-T cells. These assays represent the capability to produce, expand and study CAR-effector cells both <i>in-vitro<\/i> and <i>in-vivo<\/i>. Careful consideration of human target cells enables the efficient translation of <i>in-vitro<\/i> efficacy data to whole organism mouse models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/64c8d8d0-077b-4f77-bde2-04b29a137a73\/@A03B8ZFP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,CD19,Tumor,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16762"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lauren Kelsey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jezrom Self-Fordham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Oswald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilona Aylott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Rocca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Robert Nunan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Harris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Schueler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rhiannon Jenkinson<\/i><\/presenter>.

Even with the development of modern chemo and biologic therapies, there has not been a significant increase in the progression-free and overall survival of patients with high grade serous ovarian tumors. The goal of this study is to develop an individualized cell therapy approach for immunologic targeting of this cancer. Our proposed approach is based on harvesting and subsequently arming natural immune cells present in the peritoneal fluid (ascitic fluid) that accumulates in most ovarian cancer patients and is removed by paracentesis and discarded to alleviate discomfort. Using multiparameter flow cytometry with three 16-18 component antibody panels we have carefully characterized the T cells, dendritic cells and innate lymphoid cells present in the peritoneal fluid of 15 ovarian cancer patients. Analysis of the data using tSNE identified multiple clusters of immune cell subsets. These data indicated that in each patient, a substantial percentage of adaptive and innate lymphoid cells are present that under appropriate conditions can be reactivated to recognize and target autologous tumors (Vazquez, Jessica, et al. &#34;Identification of unique clusters of T, dendritic, and innate lymphoid cells in the peritoneal fluid of ovarian cancer patients.&#34;&nbsp;<i>American Journal of Reproductive Immunology<\/i>&nbsp;84.3 (2020): e13284). Our goal now is to use fusokines, chimeras of two distinct cytokines, to weaponized the ascitic immune cells and employ them as autologous cell therapy against ovarian cancer. The first candidate under investigation is GIFT4, a fusokine composed of GM-CSF and IL-4 that has previously been shown to eradicate Melanoma in mouse model. Using Vector Builder, we designed and produced lentiviral vectors to express GIFT4 in primary immune cells. The efficiency of human GIFT4 expression in primary immune cells was optimized by testing different promoter constructs. The efficiency of transduction was determined by monitoring the primary immune cells for secretion of GIFT4 using IL-4 and GM-CSF ELISA. The effect of GIFT4 expression on the phenotype of the primary immune cells is under investigation using multiparameter flow cytometry. The tumor targeting potential of the GIFT4 transduced peritoneal immune cells is being investigated in an ID8 mouse model of ovarian cancer. Effects of GIFT4 on the activation of specific subtypes of ascetic immunocytes and their in vivo effects in neutralizing ID8 cells in immunocompetent C57BL\/6 mice will be instrumental for developing a novel fusokine-based individualized immune cell therapy for ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea934d9e-b380-4950-b944-75b93f060823\/@A03B8ZFP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Ascites fluid,Immunotherapy,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16764"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sejal Tarun Sharma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pradyut Paul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shala Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Barroilhet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Vazquez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandar K.

Attempts to improve outcomes using immune checkpoint blockade therapy have also failed, likely because the overall Tcell infiltration in this tumor-type is low. Despite this, the presence of CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in PDAC is associated with improved survival outcomes, suggesting that other immune-based strategies could be more successful. Here, we examine <i>ex vivo<\/i> tumor-infiltrating Tcell expansion for adoptive Tcell therapy (ACT) as a potential strategy for treating PDAC. The focus of this study is to understand the transcriptional states of Tcells in the pancreas and PDACs and how they change with ex vivo expansion and re-infusion into patients as treatment strategy. We have performed both single cell transcriptome and TCR sequencing (scRNA-TCRseq) on 54,579 Tcells from 8 human PDAC samples and the <i>ex vivo <\/i>grown TIL from a subset of 6 patients and found 13 purported substates. Through TCR tracking of the Tcell clonotypes, we find that the expansion protocol is able to expand Tcells found in many different Tcell states in the primary tumor. Furthermore, we compared our thirteen tumor-infiltrating substates with 41,935 Tcells from two other independent single cell studies across 71 samples, and confirmed our substates to be present across all datasets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/df9717e7-1570-41e9-be2a-65be6dd9b94a\/@A03B8ZFP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,T cell,Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16766"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aislyn Schalck<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donastas Sakellariou-Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie-Andrée Forget<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emi Sei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tara Hughes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shanshan Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tapsi Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Hurd<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Katz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chine-Wei Tzeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shubham Pant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Milind Javle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anirban Maitra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cara Haymaker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Navin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chantale Bernatchez<\/i><\/presenter>.

We are developing dual CAR-T cells composed of a canonical activator CAR (aCAR), intended to elicit efficacy in solid tumors, and an inhibitory CAR (iCAR) designed to efficiently inhibit the aCAR activity in normal tissue and vital organs. The iCAR and aCAR scFvs of this system bind distinct cell-surface antigens that are widely co-expressed on the normal epithelial from which solid tumors originate. Upon antigen binding, signal propagation through iCAR cytoplasmic domain (iDomain) counteracts aCAR induction of CAR T-cell activation and killing; thus protecting normal tissue. Dual CAR-T cells are activated and kill when exposed to tumor cells that have lost iCAR target expression due to chromosomal loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) which is common in all cancers. iCAR-targeted LOH generates absolute and irreversible tumor specificity therefore tumor-specific overexpression of the iCAR or aCAR targets is not required. We have carried out a comprehensive screen using human T-cells to identify the most effective inhibitory iDomains derived from cell-surface receptors that naturally inhibit or moderate immune cell activation. The cell-based assay suite developed for this screen consisted of cell lines that co-express iCAR and aCAR target at clinically relevant levels and isogenic partners that mimic LOH through CRISPR editing of the iCAR target. The expression of dual CARs in T cells as biscistronic constructs introduced with lentiviral vectors was successful in a limited number of cases, and it was necessary to develop alternative methods of iCAR aCAR co-expression to complete the screen. Combining aCAR transduction with iCAR mRNA Electroporation (T-REP) proved to be a useful method to disentangle iDomain potency and expression level. The screen identified new iDomains that may expand the potential of iCAR technology in developing strategies to treat solid tumors without compromising efficacy for safety.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8c96c528-b4ae-4ba7-b31e-3b8753c11204\/@A03B8ZFP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CAR T cells,on target off tumor toxicity,screening method,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16767"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>David Bassan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Yi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neta Chaim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nir Bujanover<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarit Tabak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanya Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yael Lopesco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Leehee Weinberger<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristina Vucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Weist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caitlin Schnair<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregor B.

This has led to significant interest in optimizing cell therapy design and manufacturing. Traditionally, CAR-T cells are transfected expanded, and partially characterized before infusing into patients. However, the ability to predict <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy is still challenging. Bioenergetic metabolism has been extensively linked to immune cell function and therefore represents a key attribute to be assessed during T cell therapy optimization and production. In addition, metabolic reprogramming can represent a mechanism to drive a desired immune phenotype. Agilent Seahorse XF T cell Metabolic Profiling kit is a robust new solution that combined with the Seahorse XF analyzer, allows for the simultaneous measurement of basal metabolic requirements, metabolic poise and mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity in T cells. These parameters have been shown to correlate with increased T cell persistence and improved metabolic fitness in nutrient restricted environments. This assay incorporates an improved uncoupler (BAM15) to allow more robust measurements of mitochondrial T cell bioenergetic capacity (measured as spare respiratory capacity or maximum respiration) with minimum optimization compared to uncouplers previously utilized. The XF T cell Metabolic Profiling kit has been used to evaluate the influence of expansion media composition on the metabolic phenotype of expanded human T cells. Indeed, when human T cells were activated and expanded up to 22 days in different commercial culture media formulations supplemented with different cytokine combinations, it resulted in T cell populations with differential bioenergetic profiles and mitochondrial spare capacities. These different metabolic phenotypes also correlated with different functional markers that have previously been associated with increased persistence <i>in vivo<\/i>. Similarly, the XF T cell Metabolic Profiling kit was used to assess metabolic poise and bioenergetic capacity of activated T cells under altered or restricted metabolic conditions like the ones present in the tumor microenvironment (low glucose, low glutamine), therefore allowing for better understanding of the effect of carbon source depletion during T cell stimulation. In addition, this assay coupled to the existing XF Hu T cell activation assay allowed for the assessment of T cell &#8216;fitness&#8217; after re-stimulation in nutrient limited conditions. Taken together, the XF T cell Metabolic Profiling kit is a novel solution that provides a complete insight into the metabolic state of T cells in real-time, facilitating the evaluation of cell therapy expansion conditions and metabolic fitness of T cells under limited nutrient availability, which can be used to better design T cell therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3b791a85-72a8-418b-b22e-941d6680fc56\/@A03B8ZFP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Metabolism,Mitochondria,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16768"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jessica Walls<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoonseok Kam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Natalia Romero<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Currently available &#945;&#946; T-cell therapies come with many challenges, including alloreactivity, off-target toxicities, cytokine release syndrome, limited survival of infused cells and the necessity to gene edit cells to overcome graft vs. host disease. Whilst some of these limitations can be overcome with complex and costly gene-engineering approaches, utilizing innate immune cells which are inherently non-HMC restricted and able to orchestrate wider immune responses might provide an alternative strategy avoiding many of these obstacles. Many groups developed protocols to grow and modify natural killer cells and invariant natural killer T-cells whilst others, including ours, focused on the development of V&#948;1 &#947;&#948; T-cell-based immunotherapies. Currently, these cell types are evaluated in the clinic in both non-engineered and engineered versions. Most of these engineering principles have been directly translated from the &#945;&#946; CAR-T field without taking into consideration the biology of innate immune cells: they utilize &#945;&#946; T-cell specific co-stimulatory molecules and signaling cassettes as well as armoring strategies developed for &#945;&#946; T-cells. V&#948;1 T-cells are tissue resident lymphocytes, which for most of their lifetime remain in epithelia rich tissues. They consistently survey tissues and monitor malignant transformation using a variety of natural cytotoxicity receptors, NK like receptors and the &#947;&#948; TCR. In contrast to &#945;&#946; T-cells, V&#948;1 T-cells do not follow the &#8216;two-signal theory&#8217;: they must integrate multiple signals from an array of receptors in order to discriminate between healthy and malignant cells. We thus propose that CAR strategies exclusively utilizing CD3&#950; activation domains are not using the full potential of innate immune cells for cellular immunotherapy. Another distinguishing feature of V&#948;1 T-cells is the absence of traditional autocrine cytokine feedback loops seen in &#945;&#946; T-cells. Our results demonstrate that traditional cytokine armoring strategies utilizing forced secretion of soluble or membrane-tethered IL-15 are detrimental to the biology of V&#948;1 T-cells. By dissecting the IL-15 receptor biology we are now able to create cells that not only survive and grow in the absence of exogenous IL-15 but become more sensitive to endogenous levels. Applying &#947;&#948; T-cell biology and an adapted understanding of the IL-15 pathway, we have now created novel engineering strategies to tailor specificity, potency, and proliferation of V&#948;1 T-cells even in the presence of CAR whilst maintaining the cells&#8217; inherent ability to discriminate between healthy and malignant cells.<br \/>Preclinical evaluation of these concepts is ongoing with the aim to develop next generation tailored V&#948;1T-cell immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c1a34dd2-a92a-4d02-bfcd-ae7d41f0246b\/@A03B8ZFP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Immunotherapy,Chimeric antigen receptor,Gamma-delta lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16772"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jyothi Kumaran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajeev Karattil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>André Simoes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Alade<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mihil Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liz Wood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gonzalo Mercado Vico<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Lane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Tamagno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Edwards<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Venuso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Illingworth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alice Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Koslowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Istvan Kovacs<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Nussbaumer<\/i><\/presenter>.

Generation of antigen-specific T cells require interactions with multiple signals produced by antigen presenting cells (APCs). These signals are comprised of three components: (signal 1) the peptide-MHC complex binding to the T cell receptor, (signal 2) costimulatory molecules on the surface of APCs, and (signal 3) inflammatory cytokines binding to cognate receptors on T cells. To engineer all major cell subsets of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to become enhanced APCs (eAPCs), we used Cell Squeeze&#174; technology to deliver multiple mRNAs encoding for non-self-antigens (signal 1), CD86 (signal 2), and\/or membrane-bound cytokines (signal 3). The signal 3 molecules, membrane-bound IL-12 (mbIL-12) and membrane-bound IL-2 (mbIL-2), are chimeric proteins designed to increase the localized concentration of the cytokines at the immune synapse and limit off-target effects. Flow cytometry confirmed translation of delivered signal 2\/3 mRNAs by all major subsets within PBMCs: T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. The potency of these SQZ&#8482; eAPCs was assessed in vitro by culturing the eAPCs with antigen-specific T cells for multiple days before measuring the functionality of antigen-specific T cells via intracellular cytokine staining or ELISA. Using this approach, we demonstrate that Cell Squeeze&#174; co-delivery of antigen mRNA and signal 2\/3 mRNAs significantly enhances CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses to a variety of antigens, including CMV pp65, Influenza M1, HPV16 E6, and HPV16 E7. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SQZ&#8482; eAPCs drive significant expansion of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in a humanized mouse model. Thus, we demonstrate that Cell Squeeze&#174; can deliver multiple mRNAs encoding for signals 1, 2, and 3 to human PBMCs and has the potential to generate enhanced APCs that drive strong CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses against multiple antigens. The versatility of this approach<br \/>has the potential to enable rapid exchange of mRNA to encode for other antigens or T cell activation signals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/deaf7082-6f99-41fb-b485-759094e49f3c\/@A03B8ZFP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Adoptive immunotherapy,T cell,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16774"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Michael F.

Logic gated (LG) CARs increase control of cell therapy activation and target cell killing by requiring recognition of two or more antigens through AND or AND-NOT Boolean logic. They represent an attractive strategy for cell therapy to improve the therapeutic index by increasing specificity for tumor antigens.<br \/>We created an AND logic gate cassette deliverable by CRISPR-mediated, non-viral, site-specific integration into human T cells. This logic gate activates expression of a MSLN-targeting CAR upon ALPP\/G binding of a priming receptor (PrimeR) within high-grade serous carcinoma ovarian tumors. The PrimeR triggers proteolytic release of a chimeric, fully human transcription factor, which then translocates to the nucleus to induce expression of a minigene encoding a CAR. The PrimeR is built only from human protein sequences, reducing theoretical risk of cell therapy immunogenicity and rejection within a patient.<br \/>In order to test the specificity of our LG CARs, we integrated LG cassettes into a defined site in the T cell genome, and then co-cultured T cells with K562 cells engineered with only one target antigen (K562-ALPG or K562-MSLN), both target antigens (K562-ALPG\/MSLN), or neither target antigen (K562). LG CAR T cells only killed K562-ALPG\/MSLN cells. The specificity of this LG was also demonstrated in vivo in a dual-flank K562 model, in which only the ALPG\/MSLN tumor was inhibited by LG CAR T cells. CAR expression was not observed on LG CAR T cells recovered outside the ALPG\/MSLN tumor, and no growth inhibition was observed in K562-MSLN tumors, unlike a constitutive CAR T control. To model priming antigen heterogeneity expected in tumors, we mixed K562-MSLN cells with varying proportions of K562-ALPG\/MSLN cells. We found that the presence of only 5-15% ALPG\/MSLN cells was sufficient to effect killing of all target cells by the induced MSLN CAR. The ALPG\/MSLN LG CAR will be tested as a component of AB-1015, a novel therapy for indications including ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49dddd93-ba69-4c24-bc8e-3c137d74b3bd\/@B03B8ZFQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Ovarian cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16775"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jasper Williams<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Martinez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Boroughs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marian Sandoval<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cate Sue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Drever<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anzhi Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Choe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxim Sidorov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia Phillips<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dina Polyak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suchismita Mohanty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Santoro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Cooper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>W.

However, 10-20% of patients who receive anti-C19 CAR T-cell treatment experience relapse due to CD19 antigen loss. B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) that is expressed on the surface of normal and neoplastic B cells mediates the survival of mature peripheral B cells along with the B-cell receptor. Since B-CLL is characterized by apoptotic disruption and subsequent accumulation of mature B cells, BAFF-R is a logical, novel target for CAR T-cell therapy directed against B-CLL, especially if CD19 antigen loss occurs. In this study, we first manufactured BAFF-R CAR T-cells by infecting healthy donor Tna&#239;ve\/memory (Tn\/mem) cells with BAFF-R CAR lentivirus before evaluating the antitumor activity of BAFF-R CAR T-cells on wild type MEC-1 (a B-CLL cell line), modified MEC-1, and primary cell lines. Antigen-specific cytotoxicity and activation of the BAFF-R CAR T-cells or control CD19 CAR T-cells were determined upon incubation with B-CLL cell lines and patient-derived primary B-CLL by measuring degranulation and IFN-&#947; release, respectively. BAFF-R CAR T-cells demonstrated substantial cytotoxicity against MEC-1, CD19-deficient MEC-1, and primary B-CLL cell lines; CD19 CAR T-cells showed no effect on CD19-deficient MEC-1 cells but did show effects with primary B-CLL and MEC-1 cells. Similarly, the release of IFN-&#947; was greater when BAFF-R CAR T-cells were co-cultured with CD19-deficient MEC-1 or primary B-CLL compared to CD19 CAR T-cells co-cultured with CD19-deficient MEC-1. In summary, BAFF-R CAR T-cells exert significant antitumor properties not only on patient-derived primary B-CLL cells but also on a CD19-deficient B-CLL cell line. We, therefore, assert BAFF-R-targeting CAR T-cells to be a novel therapeutic avenue for patients newly diagnosed with B-CLL and patients experiencing relapsed B-CLL after anti-CD19 therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/85f9da20-6b87-4a5c-a03d-c12591c893d6\/@B03B8ZFQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,CD19,CAR-T therapy,B-CLL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16776"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yan Luo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaihin Lui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tommy T.
