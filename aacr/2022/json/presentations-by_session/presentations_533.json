[{"Abstract":"The metabolic enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) was identified as a synthetic lethal target in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted cancers. The co-deletion of MTAP and CDKN2A was observed in approximately 15% of all cancers and predicted worse outcomes, which provides MAT2A a potential therapeutic target. AG-270, a first MAT2A inhibitor, is currently evaluated in early clinical study. Given the inhibitory activity on UGT1A1, a bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase regulating the homeostasis of bilirubin, treatment of AG-270 led to the bilirubin increase in patients, which limited the further dose escalation. Therefore, to avoid those off-targeted side effects and maximize benefit from the MAT2A targeted therapy, it is necessary to develop a new generation of MAT2A inhibitor with better activity and higher selectivity, especially, removal of UGT1A1 activity. Here, we report SCR-7952 is a novel MAT2A inhibitor with greater potency and higher selectivity. In biochemical assay, SCR-7952 exhibited potent inhibitory activity on MAT2A enzyme with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 21 nM, which was more potent than AG-270 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 68 nM). In HCT116 MTAP-\/- cells, SCR-7952 strongly inhibited the cellular SAM production with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 2 nM, which was significantly more potent than AG-270 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 6 nM). And SCR-7952 potently inhibited HCT116 MTAP-\/- cell growth with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 53 nM, which was almost 6-fold more potent than AG-270 tested in parallel (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 300 nM). Meanwhile, SCR-7952 displayed more than 20-fold selectivity over the HCT116 parent cells on proliferation assay. However, AG-270 only demonstrated 4-fold selectivity in the same assay. Furthermore, inhibition of SCR-7952 on a panel of 47 life-dependent targets was determined at 10 &#956;M, result showed that there is no significant inhibition observed. In addition to MTAP KO cells, SCR-7952 showed potently inhibited cell growth in multiple cell lines with natural MTAP-deficiency. SCR-7952 revealed excellent oral bioavailability and PK properties in pre-clinical species. In the HCT-116 MTAP-\/- xenograft model, SCR-7952 demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity and achieved 72% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at 1 mpk, QD, which was more potent than AG-270 (TGI 56% at 200 mpk, QD). Furthermore, SCR-7952 was well tolerant and no elevation of bilirubin was observed. In contrast, AG-270 at 200mpk resulted in significant increase of bilirubin. In conclusion, the above data demonstrate that SCR-7952 is a more potent and higher selective MAT2A, and will be filed IND in 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c6e7755-e4b3-463e-9441-9526a382a19b\/@C03B8ZRt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,MAT2A,UGT1A1,High selectivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17664"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Feng Zhou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyong Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhen Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenqing Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liting Xue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renhong Tang<\/i><\/presenter>.

The aim of the current study is to investigate if CCRL2 regulates pathways associated with the development of resistance to hypomethylating agents (HMA), commonly used drugs in MDS and occasionally sAML.<br \/><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:<\/b> We used lentivirus-mediated transduction of MDS92, MDS-L and TF-1 MDS\/sAML cells to suppress CCRL2 expression. Two different shRNA constructs were used. We performed RNA sequencing and gene-set enrichment analysis of CCRL2 knocked down (KD) and wild-type (WT) TF-1 cells. We measured DNA methyl-transferases&#8217; expression by western blot, CD11b and CD71 expression was measured in MDS and sAML cells to assess cell differentiation. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V\/PI staining, and clonogenicity by methylcellulose assays. CD34+ cells were sorted from bone marrow aspirates of MDS patients before the initiation of treatment with HMA by using magnetic beads and measurement of CCRL2 was performed by flow cytometry. Response to HMA in MDS patients was assessed by 6 months of treatment based on the International Working Group response criteria.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> CCRL2 KD cells demonstrated suppression of pathways associated with PRC2 complex activity, histone modification, and DNA methylation. CCRL2 KD also lead to a more prominent degradation of DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNTM3B under azacitidine treatment. CCRL2 increased apoptosis in response to 0.5 and 1 &#956;M azacitidine (P&#60;0.010) and MDS-L cells (P&#60;0.010 with both sh1 and sh2). Similarly, CCRL2 knockdown increased morphologic differentiation with both 0.5 and 1 &#956;&#924; azacitidine (P&#60;0.010) as well as increased the clonogenic inhibition caused by azacitidine (P&#60;0.05). In order to analyze the effect CCRL2 clinically, we analyzed CCRL2 expression in CD34+ cells from patients undergoing HMA treatment. Non-responders to HMA (progressive disease) express higher levels of CCRL2 compared to CD34+ cells from responders (complete remission, partial remission or stable disease) (P=0.020).<br \/><b>DISCUSSION:<\/b> Our analysis suggests that CCRL2 regulates the expression of genes associated with induction of PRC2-mediated histone modification and DNA methylation in sAML cells. CCRL2 suppression also increased the sensitivity of MDS and sAML cells to azacitidine. In addition, increased CCRL2 expression in MDS cells is associated with worse response to HMA. These data suggest that targeting CCRL2 has therapeutic potential in MDS and sAML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6be154f8-61b5-4a82-9f32-4472cba50f78\/@C03B8ZRt\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias,DNA methyltransferase,Apoptosis,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17665"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Theodoros Karantanos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patric Teodorescu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandy Perkins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marios Arvanitis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilias Christodolou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Esteb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>W.

Aberrant activation of EZH2 drives H3K27 methylation and plays a critical role in cancer initiation and progression. Meanwhile, loss-of-function mutation in the major components of SWI\/SNF complex leads to a loss of its suppression ability against PRC2 and subsequently activates EZH2. Targeting EZH2 has been validated as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, especially for those with EZH2 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations or alterations of SWI\/SNF complex proteins that act as oncogenic drivers. Although when PRC2 was suppressed by EZH2 inhibition, the activity of EZH1 complementarily increased to replace the role of EZH2 and maintained the function of PRC2. In addition, EZH2 inhibition in hematopoietic stem cells of mice has been shown to facilitate the development of heterogeneous hematologic malignancies in an EZH1-dependent manner. As a result, dual inhibition of EZH1 and EZH2 may be more effective than EZH2 inhibition alone in suppressing PRC2 function, as well as overcoming the issues related to the development of secondary malignancies, which has been observed in the clinical development of EZH2 selective inhibitor. Thus, we discovered and developed HH2853,a dual inhibitor of EZH1\/2. The potency and selectivity of HH2853 against EZH1\/2 were assessed at biochemical and cellular levels, and its anti-tumor activities were evaluated in multiple tumor models <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>in comparison with FDA-approved EZH2 selective inhibitor tazemetostat. In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of HH2853 was characterized. HH2853 inhibited the enzymatic activities of wild-type and mutant EZH2 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 2.21-5.36 nM, which was similar to that of tazemetostat. In addition, HH2853 inhibited EZH1 enzymatic activity with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 9.26 nM, which was stronger than tazemetostat (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 58.43 nM). In contrast, HH2853 up to 10 &#956;M exhibited only marginal or minor inhibitory activity against 36 histone modification enzymes. At cellular level, HH2853 potently inhibited H3K27 mono-, di- and tri-methylation in multiple cancer cell lines with wild-type or mutant EZH2. In contrast, HH2853 up to 10 &#956;M had no effect on the other types of methylation modifications on histone H3. Moreover, HH2853 potently inhibited the cell viability of multiple cancer cell lines with EZH2 GOF mutation or alterations in SWI\/SNF complex, and exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy in several tumor xenograft models than tazemetostat at a comparable dose level. Furthermore, HH2853 exhibited superior PK property than tazemetostat. Taken together, HH2853 is a selective EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor with potent anti-tumor activities and favorable PK properties. HH2853 is currently in phase I clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6dafd4ff-6a30-4bca-8f0b-1207cdbbe539\/@C03B8ZRt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EZH2,EZH1,Inhibitor,SWI\/SNF,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17666"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xu-Xing Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian-Qian Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhao Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan-Fen Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun-Yu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying-Lei Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yixiang Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leping Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

According to the disclosed clinical data, AMG510 and MRTX849 have an ORR of 36-45% in NSCLC and of 7-22% in CRC patients harboring a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation. Incomplete target occupancy is considered to be a potential reason for only less than 50% of patients with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation benefiting from those KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors. Brain metastases developed from lung cancer, accounting for 40-50% of all brain metastases, were described as the primary or contributing cause of death in a large proportion of patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. About 55% of NSCLC patients with KRAS mutations develop brain metastases. The KRAS mutant patients with untreated brain metastasis from NSCLC have a median OS of only 5 months. Hence, in order to achieve maximal clinical benefit in patients with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation, a highly potent, brain-penetrant KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor with sufficient continuous exposure for the complete dose interval to maximize depth and duration of antitumor activity is required.

BTK is often overexpressed in B-cells of patients with hematological malignancies. BTK inhibition blocks BCR signals, prevents B-cell activation and malignant B-cell growth, and induces apoptosis. Early irreversible BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib, which covalently binds to the cysteine residue (C481) of BTK, are effective against B-cell malignancies and have received approval for various B-cell lymphomas and leukemia including mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but their effectiveness is often limited by toxicities from off-target inhibition of the Tec (e.g., ITK\/TEC) and EGFR family (e.g., EGFR\/HER2\/HER4). Acquired resistance mutations in the C481 binding site are known to cause clinical resistance to irreversible BTK inhibitors, which accounts for over half of progression in patients received ibrutinib. There is thus unmet medical need for a novel BTK inhibitor with improved safety profile efficacious against C481 mutation. Here we introduce FCN-589, a novel and orally active next-generation BTK inhibitor. FCN-589 shows potent kinase activities against wild-type (WT) BTK and the most common resistant mutation BTK C481S with single-digit nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub> and improved selectivity over clinically significant off-targets such as TRK and ITK compared with nemtabrutinib (MK-1026, ARQ 531), another BTK C481S inhibitor in development. FCN-589 exhibits remarkable anti-proliferating potency against a panel of human B-cell malignancies-derived cancer cell lines. FCN-589 is over 30x more potent against follicular lymphoma cells (DOHH2) and activated B-cell subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells (OCI-LY10 and Ri-1), and about 4x more potent against germinal center B-cell like subset of DLBCL cells (SU-DHL-4) compared with ARQ 531. In HEK-293 cell line ectopically expressing WT or BTK C481S, FCN-589 markedly inhibits p-BTK expression with superior activity compared with ARQ 531. Consistently, FCN-589 shows significant and superior anti-tumor activities in mice xenograft models derived from human non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas compared with ARQ 531 and ibrutinib. In non-clinical studies, FCN-589 exhibits good pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety properties. In particular, FCN-589 has longer T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> in both rats and dogs, displays improved CYP450 inhibition profile, and is less plasma protein bound compared with ARQ 531. Overall, FCN-589 is a novel next-generation BTK inhibitor targeting WT and BTK C481S. FCN-589 possesses potent <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-cancer activities with better selectivity against clinically significant off-targets and exhibits favorable PK and safety profiles compared with ARQ 531. FCN-589 has potential to be a more effective and safer option for patients with B-cell malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0de50274-5ddc-4eed-9555-35b8e69f7254\/@C03B8ZRt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BTK,Mutations,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Leukemias: chronic lymphocytic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17668"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shu Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haohan Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qihong Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunling Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhifu Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhifang Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xianlong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xingdong Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lihua Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xilei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiashu Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weibo Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Newly developed treatments (e.g., immunomodulators, proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies) have significantly improved outcomes, but MM inevitably relapses and is considered incurable. Genomic analysis shows that the <i>TP53<\/i> gene encoding tumor suppressor protein p53 is infrequently mutated in patients with MM, of whom<b> <\/b>about 82% retain wild-type (WT) <i>TP53<\/i>. Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that inhibits p53 via proteasome degradation. Proteasome inhibitors might help to stabilize p53 and synergize with MDM2 inhibitors. Therefore, MDM2 inhibitors that activate p53 might constitute an attractive pharmacologic approach to MM. Alrizomadlin (APG-115) is an investigational, new small molecule targeting the p53\/MDM2 interaction and is in clinical development for solid and hematologic cancers. This study aimed to evaluate whether alrizomadlin can potentiate the antitumor effects of proteasome inhibitors in MM. In cell-based antiproliferation studies, alrizomadlin demonstrated selective activity against WT <i>TP53<\/i> MM cell lines, including MOLP-8, H929, and MM1S, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.495 &#177; 0.132 &#181;M, 0.259 &#177; 0.251 &#181;M, and 0.325 &#177; 0.105 &#181;M, respectively. In contrast, alrizomadlin was inactive against <i>TP53<\/i>-mutant MM cell lines (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>&#62;10 &#181;M). In MM cell lines, APG-115 exhibited synergistic activity with anti-MM agents (e.g., carfilzomib, lenalidomide, melphalan, selinexor) and other targeted agents (e.g., panobinostat, bromodomain inhibitor OTX-015, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic-inducing ligand). <i>In vivo<\/i> studies showed that coadministration of alrizomadlin with proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or carfilzomib enhanced tumor regression (vs. single agents) in H929 xenograft models. As to mechanism, alrizomadlin likely disrupts MDM2\/p53 interactions and induces accumulation of p53, MDM2, and downstream proteins 4 hours after treatment. The proteasome inhibitors induced dose-related increases in p53 protein expression 24 hours after treatment. The combination of carfilzomib with alrizomadlin further promoted accumulation of p53 and MDM2 and increased phosphorylation of p53. As a transcription factor, p53: (1) activated expression of p21 to cause cell cycle arrest (2) augmented downstream BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), (3) increased cleavage of caspase-3 and poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1; hallmarks of apoptosis), and (4) increased apoptosis and associated antitumor effects. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the combination of MDM2 inhibitor APG-115 and proteasome inhibitors have synergistic antitumor effects on MM tumors harboring WT <i>TP53<\/i>. These data lay a foundation for clinical trials of a new and novel therapeutic option for patients with refractory MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/650244f3-bcb1-4ad4-b117-402ee1bf6d64\/@C03B8ZRt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Proteasome inhibitors,MDM2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17669"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guangfeng Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunyang Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Rui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ping Min<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Lv<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangfeng Ge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lvcheng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingjin Shang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dajun Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yifan Zhai<\/i><\/presenter>.

Peptidomimetic inhibitors of the enzymatic functionality of PSMA have been shown to be able to deliver conjugated cargo into prostate cancer cells. Most prominently PSMA-617 carrying a DOTA chelator has been labelled with therapeutic radionuclides like beta-emitting lutetium-177 or alpha-emitting actinium-225 and has shown clinical activity in late stage prostate cancer patients. We sought to develop a new PSMA-targeting small molecule conjugate that shows high uptake in PSMA-expressing tumors, is quickly cleared from the circulation, and can easily be labeled with the alpha emitter thorium-227 (half-life 18.7d).<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> Using PSMA-617 as a starting point for our venture we were able to identify a novel linker motif that showed improved competition against <sup>3<\/sup>H-PSMA-617 on PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells. Furthermore, we developed a new 2,3-hydroxypyridinone chelator (carboxy-HOPO) modified with carboxyl groups to increase hydrophilicity. The carboxy-HOPO conjugates were labelled with thorium-227 and evaluated in cellular binding, internalization, and antiproliferation assays. Furthermore, the thorium-227 labelled conjugates were tested in vivo for pharmacokinetics and efficacy in mouse xenograft models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The conjugates were readily labeled with thorium-227 at room temperature and possessed high stability and improved binding, internalization and antiproliferative activity in vitro. In vivo therapeutic studies with our new thorium-227-labelled carboxy-HOPO-PSMA small molecule conjugate in mice with PSMA-expressing tumor LNCaP xenografts showed high uptake and retention in the tumors and very fast clearance from the blood. Besides uptake in the kidneys no major uptake or retention into other organs was observed. Low uptake of free thorium-227 into the bones confirms the high complex stability in vivo with no leakage of thorium-227 from the carboxy-HOPO chelator. Single dosing with 1.5MBq\/kg led to good treatment efficacy. No signs of toxicity were observed in the treated mice during the course of the study encouraging further development of the compound.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In summary we developed a novel PSMA-targeting carboxy-HOPO small molecule conjugate that readily complexed thorium-227, showed high uptake into PSMA-expressing cells and gave statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth in tumor xenograft models compared to control groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/df904d06-26b6-4678-8307-e69122beec51\/@C03B8ZRt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Drug discovery,Targeted alpha therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17670"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c5339e0d-ee96-4b8e-a823-93cd39feae2a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c5339e0d-ee96-4b8e-a823-93cd39feae2a\/@C03B8ZRt\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Niels Boehnke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bård Indrevoll<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Hammer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Papple<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Kristian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Cuthbertson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sabine Zitzmann-Kolbe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

These represent 2 extremely aggressive and lethal types of CNS malignancies sharing a median overall survival of 12-18 months and 5-year survival rate of 5 to 30% in the US. LP-184 has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of malignant gliomas. LP-184 is activated to a highly labile metabolite by Prostaglandin Reductase 1 (PTGR1) and has potential to be a potent therapeutic as a single agent for PTGR1-expressing malignancies. LP-184 was found to have nanomolar range potency (IC50 30-400 nM) against multiple human GBM cell lines and patient-derived neurospheres <i>in vitro<\/i>. Intravenous LP-184 induced complete and durable regression of pre-established subcutaneous U87 and M1123 GBM xenografts and prolonged survival of mice bearing orthotopic U87 and M1123 xenografts (p&#60;0.0001). Activated LP-184 creates covalent DNA adducts (e.g. N3 of adenine) that are selectively repaired via ERRC-dependent nucleotide excision repair or by homologous recombination. Consistent with this, we observed 2-5X increase in cytotoxicity in U87, Mayo39, M1123 GBM cells treated with LP-184 in combination with the ERCC3 inhibitor Spironolactone relative to LP-184 alone. This supports LP-184&#8217;s function as a synthetic lethal agent in the presence of DNA repair deficiencies. &#62; 50% of newly diagnosed GBMs fail to respond to standard of care temozolomide (TMZ) due to MGMT expression (i.e.unmethylated<i> mgmt<\/i> promoter) and essentially all GBMs ultimately develop TMZ resistance. Our <i>in silico<\/i> analyses and type of DNA adduct generated by LP-184 indicate that sensitivity to LP-184 is independent of MGMT expression and potentially higher in MGMT unmethylated cancers. This is supported by <i>in vitro<\/i> toxicity assays showing LP-184 IC50s of 46 nM in LN-18 (unmethylated <i>mgmt<\/i>) and 203 nM in U87 (hypermethylated <i>mgmt<\/i>) cell lines. Analysis of genes associated with LP-184 sensitivity in solid tumor cell lines revealed that expression of SMARCB1 is significantly anti-correlated to LP-184 sensitivity, suggesting that LP-184 will be effective in ATRTs and other tumors with SMARCB1 loss. LP-184 treatment induced tumor regression in mice implanted with SMARCB1 deficient CHLA06 ATRT subcutaneous xenografts, with 2 of 10 treated mice being virtually tumor-free after 2 cycles over 22 days. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed favorable <i>in vivo<\/i> BBB permeability (mouse brain\/blood ratio=0.112) comparable to that reported for TMZ. LP-184 was also active <i>in vitro<\/i> against models of brain metastases from primary lung and breast cancers. These findings identify LP-184 as a promising new agent and support its further development for treating CNS tumors in adult and pediatric populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ca0c44b4-bba0-4247-bf17-67c2a19b47c9\/@C03B8ZRt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Synthetic lethality,Methylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17672"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aditya Kulkarni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Mutation of KRAS favors the GTP-bound active state and constitutive activation of downstream effects. KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation has been identified as an oncogenic driver of tumorigenesis, which is found in approximately 14% of lung cancer, 4% of colorectal (CRC), and 1-3% of other solid tumors. Herein, we report BPI-421286, a highly potent and selective covalent small molecular KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor. <i>In vitro<\/i>, BPI-421286 showed a high Kinact\/Ki value (256,000 M<sup>-1<\/sup> s<sup>-1<\/sup>), and inhibited KRAS-GTP\/GDP exchange with a lower IC<sub>50<\/sub> (55 nM). In cell-based assays, BPI-421286 suppressed proliferation of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant cell lines with sub-nanomolar potency, but did not affect cell lines with wide type or non-G12C KRAS mutations. BPI-421286 also inhibited phospho-ERK in MIA PaCa-2 cell with a low IC<sub>50<\/sub> value (2.9 nM). In vivo, daily oral administration of 3-100 mg\/kg BPI-421286 led to tumor growth suppression or regression in multiple KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant xenograft or PDX models of NSCLC, CRC and PDAC. The <i>in vivo<\/i> PKPD in MIA PaCa-2 xenograft model showed that durable pERK inhibition can be achieved without continuous drug exposure, featuring BPI-421286 as a covalent, non-reversible KRAS inhibitor. Combining BPI-421286 with several targeted agents, including a SHP2 inhibitor BPI-442096 and a CDK4\/6 inhibitor BPI-16350, demonstrated enhanced tumor growth inhibition compared to either agent alone. Notably, for the acquired resistance mutations that are clinically observed after KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor treatment, such as G12C\/H95D, G12C\/H95Q, G12C\/R68S and G12C\/Y96C, BPI-421286 also exhibited strong inhibitory activities, suggesting that BPI-421286 could overcome the acquired resistance of currently approved KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors. Taken together, BPI-421286 is a highly potent and selective KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor, with favorable ADME properties and wide therapeutic index in pre-clinical toxicology studies. BPI-421286 is currently in Phase 1 clinical study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13cdac34-8efb-46d8-a320-e42b0ff7a600\/@D03B8ZRu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,NSCLC,KRAS G12C inhibitor resistance,Combination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17673"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaoguan Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boyan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haibo Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Lan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lieming Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jiabing Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Small molecule inhibitors of PD-L1 are expected to overcome these limitations. We hereby present BPI-371153, an orally bioavailable small molecule that disrupts PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction similar to PD-1\/PD-L1 antibodies. BPI-371153 demonstrates high binding affinity to human PD-L1, induces PD-L1 dimeralization and disrupts PD-L1:PD-1 interaction (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60;1 nM by HTRF assay). BPI-371153 induces PD-L1 internalization with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 4.2 nM as detected by flow cytometry, activates nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) signaling in cell-based reporter assay, and effectively stimulates IFN-&#947; release in human peripheral blood monocyte-mediated tumor cell killing assay. In a syngeneic mouse model with murine MC38 colon tumor cells expressing human PD-L1 (MC38-hPD-L1 model), BPI-371153 suppressed tumor growth to an extent comparable to an anti-PD-L1 antibody. In immunocompromised mice grafted with the same cell line, no growth inhibition was observed, confirming that the pharmacologic effect of BPI-371153 indeed came from the immune system. In addition, this compound exhibits favorable ADME properties, with high oral exposure across multiple pre-clinical species.

TGase2 plays important roles in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancers, autoimmune pathologies, neurodegeneration, and Inflammation. Dysregulation of TGase 2 expression can both activate pathogenesis and aggravate disease state. TG2 is overexpressed in cancers such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pancreatic, triple negative breast (TNBC) and, gastric cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis. It is also involved in drug resistance and cancer cell metastasis. These evidences provide the rationale for the development of TGase2 inhibitors as novel anticancer agents. We selected TGase2 inhibitors from a library of compounds, validated and optimized a final compound. An optimized compound was synthesized by modifying aromatic substitution, various alkyl groups, and PK improvement in consideration of activity and physical properties and named as MD102. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of TGase2 activity inhibition of MD102 is 100-400 nM similar to positive control of streptonigrin and IC<sub>50<\/sub> of cell growth inhibition was 1~10 &#956;M in TGase2 overexpressing RCC, TNBC and gastric cancer cell lines. The cell growth inhibitory dose of MD102 was depend on the expression level of TGase2. We observed MD102 inhibited cell growth through suppression of PI3K\/AKT pathway (AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR). Also, MD102 has inhibited the<u> <\/u>growth of endothelial cell (HMVEC) with IC50 of 1.2nM and tube formation of HUVEC with 35%, suggesting antiangiogenic effect. The angiogenesis was inhibited by suppression of NFkB pathway including p50, p65, HIF1-a, and VEGF. Oral administration of MD102 once daily for 4 weeks showed significant tumor growth inhibition of 50% at 50mg\/kg compare to control group in both xenograft models of the ACHN (RCC) and MDA-MB231 (TNBC) cell lines. And as a preliminary toxicity test, oral administration of MD102 up to 2000mg\/kg for 3 weeks did not show deaths or any adverse reactions in body weight and laboratory tests of blood counts, liver and renal functions. MD102, a TGase2 inhibitor, is expected to be a potential candidate in TGase2-overexpressing cancers, including RCC and TNBC, as it shows antitumor activity without serious toxicity, although further validation is required.

High levels of IGF2BP1 expression have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with variety of cancer types. Given the correlation between elevated IGF2BP1 expression and poor clinical outcomes, the specific activation of IGF2BP paralogs in a wide variety of cancers, and the effectiveness of preventing metastasis in animal models by reducing IGF2BP1 activity, therapies directed at inhibiting IGF2BP1 function constitute a potentially powerful approach for fighting cancer. In addition, IGF2BP1&#8217;s pleiotropic effect on multiple pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic pathways makes it a promising target, as this may avoid the development of resistance, associated with targeted agents in general. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of IGF2BP1 would be expected to have minimal side effects since; i) IGF2BP1 is expressed at very low levels in normal adult tissues, and ii) adult mice with an inducible whole-mouse knockout of IGF2BP1 are healthy. To identify an efficient IGF2BP1 inhibitor, a fluorescent polarization (FP)-based high throughput screen of over 100,000 small molecules was performed, and the most promising candidates were further validated in an array of <i>in vitro<\/i> and cell-based assays leading to the identification a lead compound, &#8220;7773,&#8221; that selectively inhibited IGF2BP1 RNA binding and a variety of its cellular functions. To further optimize &#8216;7773&#8217; and create more selective, effective and safe small-molecule inhibitors of IGF2BP1 that could be developed clinically as cancer therapeutics, we conducted a SAR study based on the lead &#8216;7773&#8217; structure. Novel 27 compounds were designed and synthesized and evaluated for IGF2BP1 inhibition using our novel cell-based split-luciferase assay, which led to the identification of 6 compounds that performed similar or better than &#8216;7773&#8217;. Cell-based wound healing assay revealed that one of these selected compounds, AVJ16, was especially (&#62;14 times than &#8220;7773&#8221;) effective in inhibiting cell migration in H1299 cell line that express high levels of endogenous IGF2BP1, but not in LKR-M cells that express very low levels of IGF2BP1. The specificity of AVJ16 was further confirmed in LKR-M cells that ectopically express IGF2BP1 - these cells become sensitive to AVJ16 upon overexpression of IGF2BP1 (but not GFP). Together our data provide strong evidence for AVJ16 to be effective and selective in inhibiting IGF2BP1 function by interfering with its ability to bind target RNAs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e73bdd7-1551-48ff-a94c-cbc22061c091\/@D03B8ZRu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Metastasis,Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2),Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17676"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amandeep Singh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arun Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vladimir Spiegelman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vikash Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadav Wallis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omer Elimelech<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joel Yisraeli<\/i><\/presenter>.

Unfortunately, curative treatments such as surgery, liver transplantation, or ablation are reserved for early stages and can only be applied in less than 30% of the patients with HCC. Glycosylation can be a potent and interesting strategy for drug delivery to a specific target. We enzymatically synthesized a glycosylated derivative of the coumarin 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU), namely 4MUR.The antitumoral effect of 4MUR in comparison with the aglycone 4MU was evaluated onto liver cancer cells. Cellular toxicity was determined on murine liver tumor cell lines as well as non-hepatic tumoral cells. Tumor cell lines were significantly more sensitive than non-tumoral cells to the glycosylated molecule in a dose-dependent manner (p&#60;0.05). 4MUR was incorporated mostly into tumoral cells by the interaction with the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), which is overexpressed in liver tumor cells. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is the major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is produced at the plasma membrane by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, 2 and 3), which couple glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine into a linear polymer using the corresponding UDP-sugars (UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc) as substrates. Unlike 4MUR, the glucuronidation of 4MU competitively inhibits chain elongation of HA. Furthermore, 4MUR treatment regulates the levels of HAS2 and HAS3 expression in the tumoral cell line. Finally, 4MUR treatment induced apoptosis cell death in tumoral cells. Our results suggest that the 4MUR is safe and effective against liver tumor cells via a specific targeting to ASGPR receptor and decreasing HA synthesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,Targeted therapy,Hepatocellular carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17677"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gisela Weiz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alina L.

Only 10% of people survive five years of this grade IV cancer. Standard of care therapy comprises maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy conferring a median survival time of 14.6 months compared with 12.1 months for GBM patients treated with radiotherapy alone. First-in-class small-molecule imipridone ONC201 has shown efficacy in glioblastoma models <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>in vivo<\/i>, and <i>ex vivo<\/i>. It is also orally active and is administered once every week, a favorable dosing schedule for patients. We hypothesized that ONC201 may synergize with radiotherapy and Temozolomide in GBM <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We previously reported that ONC201 synergizes with radiotherapy and\/or TMZ to inhibit cell viability and colony formation and induce ER stress and apoptosis in GBM cells. To pursue this promising combinational therapy <i>in vivo<\/i>, we established GBM mouse orthotopic models through intracranial injection of luciferase expressing GBM cells U-251-LUC with a KOPF model 940 small animal stereotaxic frame and a Stoelting Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector. Tumor formation was confirmed with bioluminescence imaging. Randomized treatment group mice have received weekly treatment of ONC201 (100 mg\/kg p.o.) and\/or radiotherapy (2 Gy local irradiation) and\/or TMZ (20 mg\/kg i.p.) for four weeks. We observed the triple combination of ONC201 and radiotherapy and TMZ significantly reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival compared to dual combinations in GBM mouse orthotopic model U-251-LUC. We are currently exploring the synergistic mechanisms of triple combination including TRAIL signaling pathway, ISR, dopamine receptors and mitochondrial ClpXP, and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers from <i>in vivo<\/i> samples. Our study suggests that the investigational triple combination therapy of ONC201 and radiotherapy and TMZ is going to be an important option for patients with GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/266ff6f9-acef-4309-a598-b495d94e063d\/@D03B8ZRu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ONC201,Radiotherapy,Temozolomide,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17678"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lanlan Zhou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinxuan Laura Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Howard P.

Thus, there is a continuous need for developing novel approaches for the treatment of ovarian cancer, particularly drug resistant ovarian cancer, as ovarian cancer most adversely affects the lives patients. Here in, we have designed seleno-biotin derivatives as potential therapeutics for ovarian cancer. The rational for designing these hybrid small molecules is two fold: (i) The biotin receptors are up-regulated in various carcinomas including ovarian cancer cells while being expressed at low levels in normal cells. Due to the high affinity of biotin towards BR, biotin has been used as a conjugate for several targeted imaging, sensing, and delivery <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. (ii) Organoselenium compounds with appropriate selenium moieties have shown therapeutic efficacy in several pre-clinical cancer models. Therefore, we designed several analogs of biotin by conjugating selenium moieties connected through ester, selenoester, or amide functionalities and their cytotoxicities were assessed using four different ovarian cancer cell lines. Ester-linked biotin-selenocyanate compound <b>2<\/b>, out of the other analogs, in direct comparison to biotin alone, more effectively reduced the cell viability (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 9.8-18.5 &#181;M against all the tested cell lines) and induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells in dose dependent manner as demonstrated by the cell viability assay. It showed three times more potency (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 14.08 &#181;M) than standard drugs 5-FU (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 48.4 &#181;M) and cisplatin (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 41.0 &#181;M) against drug-resistant Hey A8 cancer cells and three times more activity with an IC<sub>50 <\/sub>value of 9.8 &#181;M as compared to 5-FU (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 25.92 &#181;M) against ES-2 cells. The above findings were supported by trypan blue dye exclusion assay, Annexin V\/7-AAD, Caspase 3\/7 apoptosis assays and Western blotting of apoptotic proteins. Compound <b>2<\/b> effectively caused cell cycle arrest of the treated OVCAR-3 cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, thus causing regulatory changes in the cell cycle proteins, as evident by Western blotting. In addition, compound <b>2<\/b> redox cycles was demonstrated by DCFDA based reactive oxygen species estimation. These experiments demonstrate that selenium modified biotin which contains a covalently attached redox cycling selenide group has the potential for human therapeutic applications against ovarian and other cancers over-expressing biotin receptors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2d1c8edf-4e46-4572-97b1-3cd5441936b3\/@D03B8ZRu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor agents,Therapeutic target,Chemistry,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17679"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Asif Raza<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amandeep Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amin Shantu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>L.

In addition, several epidemiological, preclinical, and clinical studies support the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).On the basis of these findings, and taking into account the results of previous studies by our research group, we have developed a new series of twenty-five NSAID analogs bearing Se in the form of selenoesters modulated with different functional groups.

It has been reported to be beneficial for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, acute and chronic myocardial infarction (MI), and ischemic stroke. Mao et al. illustrated that leonurine could up-regulate the expression of phosphorylated p38 and down-regulate phosphorylated Akt expression through inhibiting mitochondrial pathway, thus suppressing the proliferation and promoting lung cancer cell apoptosis. Accumulating evidence suggest that the extract of Leonurus sibiricus transgenic roots could induce apoptosis in different grades of human glioma cells and significantly promotes cisplatin sensitivity in cervical cancer cells via repressing cell proliferation, improving intrinsic cell apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of P-Gp and MRP1 protein, which has potential therapeutic value in cervical cancer treatment. In the present study, we designed and synthesized several selenium analogs of leonurine and their cytotoxicity were assessed using four different ovarian cancer cell lines viz. OVCAR-3, OVCAR-10, ES2, and drug resistant HeyA8 cells. Compared to the control and leonurine group, compound 834 inhibited the ovarian cancer cell viability in dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of compound 834 was 4.6 &#181;M, 3.8 &#181;M, 6.2 &#181;M, and 5.7 &#181;M for OVCAR-3, HeyA8, OVCAR-10, and ES2 cells, respectively, while for leonurine the IC<sub>50<\/sub> value was &#62;500 &#181;M for 48 h treatment. To further acquaint the effect of 48 h treatment on cell proliferation, we performed trypan blue cell viability assay, trypan blue dye exclusion assay, Annexin V\/7-AAD, Caspase 3\/7 apoptosis assays and Western blotting of apoptotic proteins involved in apoptosis. Compound 834 significantly induced apoptosis in OVCAR-3 and HeyA8 cells in dose dependent manner. Upregulation of several apoptotic proteins, as evident by Western blot, suggested that 834 causes induction of apoptotic pathways efficiently. Further, the cell cycle analysis showed a significant arrest of OVCAR-3 and HeyA8 cells in the S-phase, which was further confirmed by the analysis of cyclin A2, cyclin-E1, p21 and p27 proteins expression. Conclusively, our research revealed that leonurine analog 834 significantly induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells via repressing cell proliferation, improving intrinsic cell apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of several signaling proteins, which has potential therapeutic value in ovarian cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/869a1e76-6311-4097-8f65-602895d09709\/@E03B8ZRv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor agents,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17682"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Asif Raza<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacek Krzeminski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shantu Amin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arun Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>.

There are 3 classes of PI3K, among which Class I PI3Ks including PI3K&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, and &#948; isoforms are the mostly studied and plays key roles in physiological functions. PI3K&#945; has a role in insulin-dependent signaling, PI3K&#946; functions in platelet aggregation, thrombosis and insulin signaling, and PI3K&#947;\/&#948; are expressed mainly in leukocytes and regulate lymphocyte activation, mast cell degranulation, and chemotaxis. Early PI3K inhibitors such as idelalisib are effective against B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but their clinical use is largely limited due to intolerable toxicities. More selective PI3K&#948; inhibitors such as umbralisib (TGR-1202) demonstrates improved clinical efficacy and safety profile compared to current standard of care and was recently approved as a monotherapy for follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. However, there is still unmet medical need for novel PI3K&#948; inhibitors with improved safety profile and better efficacy to be used as monotherapy and in suitable combination strategies. Here we introduce FCN-289, a novel and oral next-generation PI3K&#948; inhibitor. FCN-289 demonstrates potent kinase activity against PI3K&#948; with single-digit nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub> and remarkably improved selectivity over other PI3K isoforms compared with TGR-1202. FCN-289 exhibits significant anti-proliferating activity against various human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-derived cancer cell lines (OCI-LY10, TMD-8 and WSU-NHL) with superior activity compared with TGR-1202. Consistently, FCN-289 shows dose-dependent anti-tumor growth activity superior to that of TGR-1202 at the same and higher dose in TMD-8 DLBCL xenograft models. FCN-289 shows significantly improved anti-tumor activity when combined with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in TMD-8 and OCI-LY10 DLBCL xenograft models. In non-clinical settings, FCN-289 exhibits good pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety properties with shorter T<sub>max<\/sub> and higher bioavailability in both rats and dogs, higher exposure in rats, improved CYP450 inhibition profile, and less plasma protein bound ratio compared with TGR-1202.Together, FCN-289 is a novel PI3K&#948; inhibitor that possesses more potent <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-cancer activities in B-cell malignancies-derived models with improved selectivity against other PI3K isoforms compared with TGR-1202. Combination with ibrutinib further improves anti-tumor activity compared with monotherapy. FCN-289 shows favorable PK and safety profiles compared with TGR-1202. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of FCN-289 as a novel targeted approach as monotherapy or in combination for treating B-cell malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f8f4d845-624d-4747-8a49-a7e9a6dab355\/@E03B8ZRv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Leukemias: chronic lymphocytic,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17684"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shu Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zuwen Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huajie Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weipeng Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ling Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lijun Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xingdong Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanxin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zongyao Zou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuwei Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiashu Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weibo Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Aberrant activation of PI3K&#948; signaling pathway promotes the survival and proliferation of malignant B cells, making selective inhibition of this isoform a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of B cell malignances. Amdizalisib (HMPL-689, Amdiz), discovered and being currently developed in a pivotal phase II clinical trial (NCT04849351) by HUTCHMED, is a highly potent and selective PI3K&#948; inhibitor. Based on encouraging clinical data from the phase Ib study (2021 ESMO, abstract# 8330), Amdiz is a designated breakthrough therapy in China for treatment of relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma. Herein, we report the pre-clinical anti-tumor activity of Amdiz.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Kinase activity was measured by Transcreener&#8482; Fluorescence Polarization assay. The kinome selectivity profile of Amdiz was evaluated in Eurofins KinaseProfiler&#8482; panel containing 323 kinases.<b> <\/b>Cell based phosphorylation of AKT was determined by using Acumen Explorer system. CD63 expression in basophils was evaluated by FACS assay. Inhibitory effects of Amdiz alone or in combination with other agents on cell viability were investigated in a panel of B cell lymphoma cell lines by CellTiter-Glo luminescent or CCK-8 assay. The ability of Amdiz to inhibit the activation of B cells in animals was evaluated in na&#239;ve rats using an <i>ex vivo <\/i>assay, and B cell activation was determined by evaluating CD86 expression using FACS analysis. Human B cell lymphoma cell line derived xenograft models were used to determine the anti-tumor activity of Amdiz in combination with other agents such as rituximab, BTK inhibitor, and venetoclax.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Amdiz is a highly selective inhibitor of PI3K&#948;, showing more than 250-fold selectivity over other PI3K isoforms and no significant inhibition over other 319 protein kinases at the concentration of 1 &#181;M. Amdiz potently inhibited PI3K&#948; in biochemical, cellular and human whole blood assays with IC50s ranging from 0.8-3 nM. Its inhibitory effects on cell viability were also evaluated in a panel of B -cell lymphoma cell lines. Results showed that Amdiz potently inhibited cell survival with IC50s from 0.005 to 5 &#956;M. Amdiz showed a long-lasting and strong inhibition on B cell activation in a rat pharmacodynamics (PD) study at a dose as low as 0.1 mg\/kg. Moreover, Amdiz significantly improved anti-tumor activity of standard-of-care agents as well as targeted agents in multiple B-cell lymphoma models both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Amdiz is a highly potent and selective PI3K&#948; inhibitor with strong activity against B-cell lymphoma in pre-clinical studies, supporting clinical evaluation as either a single agent or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aea1ba31-9694-4383-8c8f-9720efdb94ec\/@E03B8ZRv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Preclinical,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17685"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jia Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianhan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoming Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianlin He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junqing Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juntao Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linfang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiong Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiguo Qing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongxin Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiguo Su<\/i><\/presenter>.

Selinexor is a first-in-class oral inhibitor of Exportin 1 (XPO1\/CRM1) with broad anti-cancer activities and is clinically approved to treat multiple myeloma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In a phase 2 study of recurrent GBM, monotherapy of selinexor demonstrated clinically relevant disease control (Lassman 2021 Clin Cancer Res). Our previous preclinical studies identified synergy between selinexor and proteasome inhibitors in GBM <i>in vitro<\/i>. Among the proteasome inhibitors tested, we chose to focus on marizomib due to its ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, supporting its use in GBM. We tested GBM cell lines and mouse xenograft models to evaluate the anti-GBM effects of selinexor and marizomib in combination.<br \/>Methods: Cytotoxic effects of selinexor and marizomib were evaluated with two GBM cell lines LN18 and U87MG. The anti-GBM effects of selinexor and marizomib were further investigated <i>in vivo<\/i> with U87MG mouse xenograft models of GBM. Female nude mice carrying U87MG subcutaneous implants were treated with vehicle, selinexor, marizomib or the combination of the two agents (six mice per treatment group). Tumor volume and body weight were monitored throughout the study. Tumor samples were collected at the end of the study for transcriptomic analysis and immunohistochemistry tests.<br \/>Results: Synergistic anti-GBM effects of selinexor and marizomib were observed in both LN18 and U87MG cells <i>in vitro.<\/i> In mouse xenograft models of U87MG, tumor growth was significantly inhibited by selinexor and marizomib single agents relative to controls, at Day 15 of the study, tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was 60.0% (p=0.0009) for selinexor (10 mg\/kg, once per week), 49.2% (p=0.0069) for marizomib once weekly at 75 &#181;g\/kg, and 33.1% (p=0.0991) for marizomib once every 2 weeks at 75 &#181;g\/kg. Synergistic anti-GBM effect was observed in the combination groups, with a TGI of 99.6% (p&#60;0.0001) for selinexor with once weekly marizomib, and a TGI of 90.0% (p&#60;0.0001) for selinexor with once every other week marizomib.<br \/>Conclusions: Synergistic anti-GBM effects of selinexor and marizomib in preclinical models warrants further investigation. The synergism is likely due to enhanced inhibition of the NF&#954;B signaling pathways as previously demonstrated for selinexor and proteasome inhibitor combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/73415dad-1328-4775-b234-86e369f6f409\/@E03B8ZRv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-08 Proteasome inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,Proteasome inhibitors,Glioblastoma,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17686"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"282bc2e6-121a-43c0-ac50-93bbdf095179","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/282bc2e6-121a-43c0-ac50-93bbdf095179\/@E03B8ZRv\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hua Chang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leah Henegar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher J.

Although the patients initially well responded to FLT3 inhibitors such as gilteritinib, the most cases relapsed within a few months after the initiation of treatment. For these patients who relapsed after FLT3 inhibitor-based therapy, no effective treatment is available. Mechanisms of resistance are not fully elucidated, but FLT3-ITD-TKD double mutant is considered as one of possible mechanisms. We have discovered a novel FLT3 inhibitor OTS447 that shows the potent and selective inhibition in both FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD-TKD double mutants.<br \/>OTS447 was identified through the screening of our in-house proprietary compound library. It showed potent inhibitory activity against FLT3 with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 0.19 nM. The selectivity of OTS447 was investigated by human kinase profile assay. Among 371 human kinases tested, there were only seven (including FLT3) whose activity were inhibited by 80% or more at 5 nM of OTS447. We then examined the anti-proliferative effects in FLT3-ITD and -wild type (WT) AML cell lines. The proliferation of FLT3-ITD cell lines, MV4-11 and MOLM13, was more strongly suppressed than that of FLT3-WT cell lines. We also investigated the inhibitory effects to FLT3-ITD-TKD double mutants using Ba\/F3 cells. FLT3-ITD-D835Y mutant was inhibited as strongly as FLT3-ITD mutant, and FLT3-ITD-F691I mutant was more strongly inhibited than Ba\/F3 parental cells. These data suggest that OTS447 has selective inhibitory activity against FLT3 mutants. To confirm that FLT3 inhibition by OTS447 leads to the anti-proliferative effect, FLT3 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as STAT5, ERK and AKT were examined. Both autophosphorylation of FLT3 and phosphorylation of downstream molecules were decreased by OTS447 in dose-dependent manner. Moreover, treatment of OTS447 induced the apoptosis and increased sub-G1 population in MV4-11 cell. Finally, we tested OTS447 anti-tumor effect using MV4-11 mouse xenograft model. OTS447 showed potent growth inhibition against MV4-11 tumor in dose-dependent manner.<br \/>In summary, we discovered OTS447, a potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor, that can inhibit not only ITD mutation but also ITD-TKD mutations of the <i>FLT3<\/i> gene. OTS447 possesses cytotoxic activity induced by inhibition of FLT3 signaling pathway and has anti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft model. We are pursuing further optimization of the inhibitor aiming for the effective treatment of AML patients with several types of FLT3-activating mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5773a958-eddb-4b82-a9da-6fff56724ce2\/@E03B8ZRv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"FLT3,Inhibitors,Mutations,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17687"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yasuhide Okamoto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naofumi Takamatsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Miyamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akiko Taira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kozue Toyota<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yukiho Imai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shinobu Fujii<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rumiko Ono<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyoko Adachi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yo Matsuo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suyoun Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae-Hyun Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

But the application of the inhibitors was restricted to a few types of tumors (e.g., melanoma). Common adverse effects such as pruritus and skin papilloma have limited the usage. It could be attributed to the paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway. The paradoxical activation also leads to tumor promotion in <i>BRAF<\/i> wild-type melanoma and skin toxicity in 30%-70% patients with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations. Therefore, development of type II pan-RAF inhibitors which avoid MAPK paradoxical activation is necessary.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The selective pan-RAF inhibitor QLH11906 was tested on A\/B\/C RAF kinases and a representative kinase panel. Both 2D and 3D proliferation studies were conducted for cell lines with <i>BRAF<\/i> and various <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations, followed by both immunoprecipitation and ERK phosphorylation assays to elucidate the mode of action. Combination studies with MEK inhibitors were implemented in both <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant cell lines and <i>BRAF<\/i>\/<i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant patient derived organoids (PDO). Single-agent and combination studies were also carried out in vivo on both <i>BRAF<\/i>\/<i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> QLH11906 inhibited wild-type A\/B\/C RAF and BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> with the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 4.9, 1.9, 0.5, and 1.1 nM, respectively, and showed no inhibition at 1 &#956;M in a selectivity panel of 28 kinases except for DDR1 and DDR2. Under 2D culture condition, QLH11906 inhibited proliferation of various <i>BRAF<\/i>\/<i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant cell lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 300-1700 nM) and suppressed ERK phosphorylation (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 20-600 nM). In 3D cultures, QLH11906 showed higher activity in proliferation suppression in both HCT116 (<i>KRAS<\/i><sup>G13D<\/sup>, IC<sub>50<\/sub> 24 nM 3D vs 1186 nM 2D) and Calu-6 (<i>KRAS<\/i><sup>Q61K<\/sup>, IC<sub>50<\/sub> 85 nM 3D vs 1411 nM 2D). In immunoprecipitation studies with HCT116 and Calu-6 cells, both BRAF homodimers and BRAF\/CRAF heterodimers could be detected under the treatment of QLH11906. QLH11906 showed synergistic effect when combined with MEK inhibitors trametinib or cobimetinib in <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant cell lines, including A549 (<i>KRAS<\/i><sup>G12S<\/sup>), Calu-6, HCT116, NCIH2122 (<i>KRAS<\/i><sup>G12C<\/sup>) and Panc1005 (<i>KRAS<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup>), and 77%-99% tumor suppression was reached at the expected clinical C<sub>trough<\/sub> concentrations.

EGFR activating mutations, such as exon 19 deletions (Del19) and L858R substitution, have been reported in 10-50% of patients with NSCLC. Although these patients respond well to early generations of TKIs, acquired resistance by mechanisms such as T790M mutation compromises their efficacy. Recently, the C797S mutation in combination with Del19 or L858R, and with T790M, has emerged as one of the most common mechanisms underlying on-target resistance to a third generation EGFR TKI, osimertinib. We are developing a fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor, H002, with a wide spectrum and high selectivity to address the growing unmet needs in NSCLC patients harboring C797S mutation.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>H002&#8217;s selectivity was assessed by KINOME<i>scan<\/i> against more than 400 human kinases. A panel of 44 kinases was further evaluated to enable early identification of off-target effect. <i>In vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy was determined in drug-resistant mutant cell lines, CDX and PDX models. Single mutants (Del or L858R), double mutants (Del\/T790M or L858R\/T790M) and triple mutants (Del\/T790M\/C797S or L858R\/T790M\/C797S) as well as wild type EGFR were assessed. Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties were further assessed. H002&#8217;s safety profile was evaluated in rats and beagle dogs, and by hERG potassium channel assay. Acute toxicity, and repeated dose GLP toxicity studies were also conducted in IND-enabling studies.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> High kinase selectivity and very low off-target effects were demonstrated by kinome-wide profiling and safety screening. H002 was highly active against all forementioned single, double or triple EGFR mutants (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 5 nM), and highly selective against wild type EGFR. H002 also exhibited potent anti-tumor effects in a dose-dependent manner in various CDX and PDX models. Excellent PK properties were observed in rats and beagle dogs with bioavailability over 70%. H002 was shown to cross the blood-brain barrier post i.g. administration in rats. No adverse effects of respiratory, cardiovascular and central nervous system were observed in safety studies. Repeated-dose toxicity studies only showed EGFR-related adverse reactions, such as gastrointestinal and liver toxicity, with high safety margin over 10-folds.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> H002 has been demonstrated as a promising next generation EGFR inhibitor, with high selectivity, a wide spectrum and potent anti-tumor activity against various EGFR activating mutations, favorable DMPK and safety profiles. It will be further developed as a fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor to overcome drug resistance in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f3dbbe46-bf1b-49b4-8b16-21d2d041cbd7\/@E03B8ZRv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,EGFR TKI resistance,C797S,fourth-generation EGFR TKI,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17692"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Wei Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoe Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jia Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangyu Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiming Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunchuan Jia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Haibo Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianming Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xianming Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caihong Yun<\/i><\/presenter>.

EGFR-TKIs have brought benefit to NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, prolonging PFS and increasing quantity of life. Nevertheless, resistance inevitably emerges and leads to disease progression. Acquired EGFR C797S mutation is the most common event underlying resistance to the 3<sup>rd <\/sup>generation EGFR-TKIs, and there are no therapies. Herein, we report the discovery of BPI-361175, a 4<sup>th<\/sup> generation EGFR-TKI that overcomes EGFR resistant mutations. <i>In vitro<\/i>, BPI-361175 potently inhibited the activity of a variety of EGFR kinases, including triple (EGFR<sup>del19 or L858R\/T790M\/C797S<\/sup>), double (EGFR<sup>del19 or L858R\/T790M<\/sup>, EGFR<sup>del19 or L858R\/C797S<\/sup>) and single (EGFR<sup>del19 or L858R<\/sup>) mutations. Accordingly, BPI-361175 dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR and the proliferation of cell lines harboring the above-mentioned mutations. Meanwhile, BPI-361175 were not active towards EGFR<sup>WT<\/sup> and IGF1R, therefore displayed good selectivity, both in kinase assays and in cell-based assays. <i>In vivo<\/i>, oral administration of BPI-361175 led to tumor suppression and regression in multiple EGFR mutant models, such as BaF3 EGFR<sup>Del19 or L858R\/T790M\/C797S<\/sup>, BaF3 EGFR<sup>Del19\/C797S<\/sup> allograft models, and PC9 EGFR<sup>Del19\/T790M\/C797S<\/sup>, NCI-H1975 EGFR<sup>Del19\/T790M\/C797S<\/sup>, NCI-H1975 (EGFR<sup>L858R\/T790M<\/sup>), HCC827 (EGFR<sup>Del19<\/sup>) CDX models, as well as a LDI-0025-200717 (EGFR<sup>Del19\/T790M\/C797S<\/sup>) PDX model.

Allosteric inhibition of SHP2 phosphatase is a potential therapeutic strategy for cancers harboring oncogenic mutations in the KRAS pathway. SHP2 also participates in the signal transduction downstream of regulatory immunoreceptors, and it has been shown in preclinical models that SHP2 inhibition drives anti-tumor immunity through modulation of both innate and adaptive mechanism. BPI-442096 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule SHP2 inhibitor. It exhibited significant anti-proliferation activities against multiple KRAS mutant cancer cell lines, including those from NSCLC, PDAC, CRPC, etc. BPI-442096 dose-dependently inhibited SHP2 phosphatase and downstream ERK phosphorylation in cancer cells, as well as NFAT reporter gene expression downstream of PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling in immune cells<i>. In vivo<\/i>, BPI-442096 demonstrated strong tumor growth inhibition in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, and KRAS<sup>G12V <\/sup>mutant xenograft mouse models. BPI-442096 also exhibited anti-tumor immunity in the MC38 syngeneic model, as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD1\/PD-L1 drugs. Moreover, BPI-442096 combining with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor may reverse intrinsic and acquired resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition. Adequate oral exposure across multiple pre-clinical species and good ADME properties ensured the druggability of BPI-442096. In conclusion, BPI-442096 exhibits a robust anti-tumor effect in multiple KRAS mutant models and enhanced anti-cancer immunity in syngeneic mouse models, and it shows multiple combination potentials to overcome drug resistance.

Epigenetic alterations, especially DNA methylation, result in silencing of tumor suppressor and differentiation-associated genes, confer chemoresistance and are linked to stemness. Although our and others&#8217; previous studies demonstrated that hypomethylating agents (HMA) could re-sensitize OC cells to chemotherapy, translation to the clinic has been slow due the poor stability and bioavailability of existing HMAs. Novel agents are critically needed.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> NTX 301 is a novel, highly potent and orally bioavailable HMA, in early clinical development, provided by PinotBio.

Treatment with NTX301 induced more significant downregulation of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1-3 expression in SKOV3 and OVCAR5 cells compared with decitabine (p&#60;0.05). Treatment with low dose NTX301 (100nM) reset the transcriptome of OC cells, inducing about 15,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to DMSO (P&#60;0.05). Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis classified upregulated DEGs enriched in biological processes related to <i>cellular response to<\/i> <i>DNA damage stimulus, DNA repair, positive regulation of cell cycle process<\/i>; down-regulated DEGs enriched in processes of <i>regulation of alcohol, cholesterol, and fatty acid biosynthesis and regulation of cell migration. <\/i>GO analysis indicated NTX301 down-regulated molecular functions related to <i>aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and oxidoreductase activity<\/i>, known features of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Indeed, treatment with low dose NTX301 (100nM, 4 days) reduced ALDH(+) cell population, inhibited their self-renewal ability, and repressed the stemness-related transcription factor, Sox2 (P&#60;0.05). We next tested the effects NTX301 in cisplatin (CDDP) resistant OC cells, developed by repeated treatments with CDDP. Priming with NTX301 reduced the IC<sub>50 <\/sub>(~two-fold) to CDDP in OVCAR5_CDDP (5.43&#956;M vs. 9.79&#956;M) and OVCAR4_CDDP (2.19&#956;M vs. 9.29&#956;M) resistant cells (p&#60;0.05). NTX301 with CDDP induced phospho-&#947;H2AX and cleaved caspase 3. To discover the mechanisms by which NTX301 restored chemosensitivity, we measured its effects on Schlafen-11 (SLFN11), a DNA damage response regulator silenced through methylation.

Accordingly, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the gold standard for the treatment of advanced PCa, but progression to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) follows. Enzalutamide (ENZ) is an AR antagonist used for the management of CRPC. However, patients acquire resistance to the drug in a short period. Meanwhile, cholesterol is a precursor to androgen and its metabolism is dysregulated in PCa. In addition, cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation aggravates tumor growth but its association with ENZ treatment has not been studied. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of CE formation by blockage of sterol-O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) could enhance the response to ENZ. We found that SOAT1 mRNA is upregulated in clinical prostate tumors compared to normal\/benign tissues in TCGA dataset. SOAT1 mRNA level was also highly correlated with AR expression in SU2CF\/PCF cohorts and TCGA dataset, suggesting critical role of the cholesterol metabolism in prostate tumor progression and potential association to AR signaling pathway. We treated 22RV1 prostate cancer cells with ENZ in the presence or absence of SOAT1 inhibitor, avasimibe, and found the combination treatment effectively reduced the level of CEs compared to control, which accompanied inhibition of colony formation and cell proliferation. Combination index value was calculated and the relationship between the two drugs showed synergism. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of SOAT1 sensitized cells to ENZ treatment and also reduced the number of colonies formed. In TCGA dataset, patients who had previously undergone ADT were analyzed, and their Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed low SOAT1 expressing patients had a significantly longer progression-free survival rate than their counterpart, indicating that SOAT1 could act as a prognostic biomarker predicting PCa treatment outcome. Gene set enrichment analysis of patients with ADT history showed androgen response gen sets were enriched in high SOAT1 expressing PCa patient group. Inhibition of SOAT1 and the combination treatment did not change AR and ARV7 protein level, but downstream genes such as PSA were down regulated upon the combination treatment. In summary, our<i> in vitro <\/i>results showed blockage of SOAT1 enzyme sensitized PCa cells to ENZ treatment and analysis of PCa patient data suggested that SOAT1 gene expression has potential as a prognostic marker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/732f2fb6-e228-479b-b5bc-8d581f12226c\/@n03B8ZRw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Cholesterol,Androgen receptor,Enzalutamide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17698"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sora Q.

Here, we developed a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degrader of ATPase subunits of the SWI\/SNF complex, SMARCA2 and SMARCA4. Intriguingly, we found androgen receptor (AR)\/forkhead box A1 (FOXA1)-positive prostate cancer to be exquisitely sensitive to dual SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 degradation relative to benign prostate as well as other cancer cell lines, including those with inactivating SMARCA4 mutations. Mechanistically, SWI\/SNF inhibition rapidly compacts the cis-regulatory elements that are bound and activated by transcription factors that drive cancer proliferation, namely AR, FOXA1, ERG, and MYC. This ensues in chromatin untethering of these oncogenic drivers, chemical decommissioning of their core enhancer circuitry, and attenuation of downstream gene programs. Furthermore, we found SWI\/SNF inhibition to disrupt super-enhancer and promoter DNA looping interactions that wire supra-physiologic expression of the AR, FOXA1, and MYC oncogenes, thereby tempering their expression in cancer cells. Monotherapy with the SMARCA2\/4 degrader induced potent inhibition of tumor growth in cell line-derived xenograft models of prostate cancer and remarkably synergized with AR antagonists, inducing disease remission in models of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We also found the combinatorial treatment to significantly inhibit the growth of enzalutamide resistant disease using in vitro as well as patient-derived xenograft models. Notably, no major toxicities were seen in mice upon prolonged treatment with the SMARCA2\/4 degrader, including no indications of thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal goblet cell depletion, or germ cell degeneration. Taken together, these results suggest that impeding enhancer accessibility through SWI\/SNF ATPase inactivation represents a novel therapeutic approach in enhancer addicted human cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/576a05ab-1c74-4190-b23e-b9587c758d04\/@n03B8ZRw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Prostate cancer,Therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18614"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lanbo Xiao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhijit Parolia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuanyuan Qiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pushpinder Bawa Pushpinder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjana Eyunni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Mannan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra E.

MPM has unique molecular features such as wild-type p53 (&#62;90% regardless of histology) and aberrantly activated NF-&#954;B. A diverse spectrum of anti-MPM therapeutic agents have been trialed, but clinically effective ones remain elusive. Herein, we propose to use a novel small molecule (CBL0137) that simultaneously suppresses NF-&#954;B and activates tumor suppressor p53 via targeting FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) complex, a histone chaperone critical for DNA repair in cancers.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Methods: <\/b>We employed in-silico, in-vitro and in-vivo MPM models and patient tumor specimens to characterize CBL0137 efficacy in MPM. CBL0137 effects were assessed in a panel of MPM cell lines by proliferation, colony foci formation, flow cytometry, and cell cycle assays. Drug-specific mechanisms were verified at transcript and protein levels using appropriate molecular assays. Both monotherapy and combinatorial regimens were tested to evaluate the optimal deployment of CBL0137 in comparison to several controls including standard chemotherapy. Immunodeficient (NSG) mice with subcutaneous and orthotopic MPM tumor grafts were used to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of CBL0137. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were applied for survival outcomes.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We observed that transcript and protein levels of SSRP1 and SPT16, subunits of the FACT complex, were significantly upregulated in our collection of MPM cell lines and specimens compared to normal. The TCGA database revealed that overexpression of these FACT subunits was associated with poor survival. As determined by western blot and luciferase-reporter assay, CBL0137 simultaneously inhibited NF-&#954;B and activated p53 in MPM cells. CBL0137 treatment significantly (p&#60;0.05) suppressed MPM cells proliferation, invasiveness, colony foci formation, and increased the number of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, in combination with cisplatin, CBL0137 exhibited additive anti-tumor activity in much lower dose ranges compared to monotherapy. Additionally, CBL0137 synergized with different classes of agents like microRNA-215, which triggers activation of p53 via regulation of MDM2 at transcript level. In vivo, CBL0137 treatment significantly suppressed MPM tumor growth in subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models compared to control. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that CBL0137 treatment improved overall survival.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> MPM is dependent on FACT for tumor progression since higher levels of SSRP1 and SPT16 are associated with worse prognosis. This MPM vulnerability can be leveraged to identify novel therapeutic paradigms. Targeting this MPM dependency by CBL0137 (dual effects on NF-&#954;B and p53) alone or in various combinations with different classes of drugs holds great promise for improved outcomes regardless of histotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6e1a0030-801f-4cd4-ba0b-ba311de45736\/@n03B8ZRw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelioma,p53,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18615"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anand Singh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathanael Pruett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roma Pahwa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sudheer K.

CDK9 complexes with cyclin T and cyclin K, the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), and phosphorylates Serine 2 of RNA polymerase II (pSer2 RNAPII) to activate transcription. Consequently, targeting CDK9 could effectively interfere with epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming and prevent disease progression and treatment resistance in human cancers. Androgen receptor (AR)-dependence in prostate cancer is linked to CDK9 function. CDK9 stabilizes AR-associated proteins, and pharmacological inhibition of CDK9 can inhibit AR, AR variants, and their downstream transcription programs. We evaluated the novel CDK9 inhibitor, PRT2527, in prostate cancer models to evaluate its effects on cell proliferation, stem-like tumor cells, and tumor growth. PRT2527 is a potent inhibitor of CDK9\/CyclinT1 complex, and when evaluated at concentration 200 times the biochemical IC<sub>50<\/sub>, PRT2527 was highly selective for CDK9 inhibition. We verified in biochemical assays the ability of PRT2527 to suppress pSer2 RNAPII and reduce expression of c-Myc, a common target of CDK9, in a concentration-dependent manner in multiple human prostate cancer cell lines. PRT2527 also inhibited c-Myc-dependent transcription in vitro in luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, RNA sequencing showed altered expression of several genes with significant enrichment of c-Myc and E2F targets and RNAPII dependent transcription among downregulated genes in PRT2527-treated VCaP cells. In vitro, PRT2527 inhibited the proliferation of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, &#8804;50 nM). PRT2527 was highly effective (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, &#8804;10 nM) in tumor-spheroid assays in blocking the growth of stem-like tumor cells and significantly suppressed the in vitro growth of tumor organoids from both human cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). In mice, PRT2527 IV administration reduced pSer2 RNAPII in tumor xenografts and c-Myc-dependent transcriptional activity in a DU145 luminescence reporter model. PRT2527 administration in mice significantly reduced growth of PDX LuCaP 35 (castration-sensitive, adenocarcinoma) and LuCaP 145.2 (castration-resistant, neuroendocrine) along with the fraction of tumor-initiating stem-like cells in ex vivo assays. PRT2527 reduced pSer2 RNAPII in both PDXs, whereas c-Myc decreased in LuCaP 35 and Sox2 in LuCaP 145.2, relative to basal expression levels. Collectively, our data demonstrate that PRT2527 has potent pharmacodynamic and antitumor activity in multiple models of castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer. PRT2527 is advancing into phase 1 studies in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c135cce1-59c0-4802-8df4-4e4ec8be55c7\/@n03B8ZRw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK inhibitor,Prostate cancer,CDK9,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18616"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elisa Federici<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianluca Civenni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Kokanovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giada Sandrini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Guarrera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Mosole<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessia Cacciatore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valeria Uboldi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuel Lessi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Papa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Domenico Albino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Storelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Merulla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Rinaldi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Bolis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kris Vaddi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peggy Scherle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce Ruggeri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuseppina M.

DMG, unlike other types of brain tumors, exists in a hypomethylated epigenetic state. In this study, we investigate the contribution of the Ten Eleven Translocation (TET) enzymes towards this unique epigenetic landscape. The TET enzymes which reduce 5methylcytosine (5mC) to 5hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are essential for removing the methylation marks in the genome. In our previous studies, we saw that there is an increased TET expression in DMG, while 5hmC was not globally decreased. We hypothesized that inhibiting the TET enzymes would restore the epigenetic balance in DMG. We targeted the TET pathway with two different TET inhibitors, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a competitive inhibitor of &#945;KG dependent dioxygenases, as well as Bobcat 339, a cytosine based TET inhibitor. We found that 2HG, when used in concentrations from 100&#181;M to 300&#181;M, had a dose dependent effect in reducing the levels of 5hmC and increasing the levels of 5mC. We performed a dot blot assay and observed a ~70% reduction in 5hmC intensity and 2 fold increase in the 5mC intensity, depending on the cell line. This change in the genomic 5hmC and 5mC levels was associated with reduced proliferation (~96% reduction in the phospho-RB band intensity as measured by a western blot in HSJD007) and induction of apoptosis (7 fold increase in cleaved caspase3 signal as measured by immunofluorescence in HSJD007, P&#60;0.0001 compared to control). 2HG also reduced the levels of the stem cell marker Nestin by ~62% in JHHDIPG1 as measured by western blot. Similarly, Bobcat 339, when used in concentrations from 10&#181;M to 50&#181;M, also had a dose dependent effect in reducing 5hmC and increasing 5mC, with ~94% reduction in 5hmC levels and up to a 6 fold increase in the 5mC levels, depending on the cell line. This change in the genomic 5hmC and 5mC levels was also associated with reduced proliferation (up to a ~70% reduction in phospho-RB band intensity as measured by a western blot in HSJD007) and induction in apoptosis (up to 8 fold increase in cleaved caspase3 signal as measured by immunofluorescence in HSJD007, P&#60;0.0001 compared to control) Additionally, we found that 2HG and Bobcat 339 synergize to further reduce the levels of 5hmC. The combination reduced the levels of 5hmC by ~60% in cells treated with 100&#181;M of 2HG and 20&#181;M of Bobcat 339 in JHHDIPG1 when compared to the 5hmC levels in cells treated with either 2HG or Bobcat 339. We also observed that a ~3 fold increase in cPARP band intensity in the combination treated cells as compared to the controls. These results indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of the TET pathway increases 5mC and decreases 5hmC, restoring epigenetic balance, decreasing proliferation and inducing cell death in DMG. Targeting TET enzymes may be of value therapeutically in epigenetically driven diseases like DMG.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1efb10c3-744c-4311-8457-58b4ccbfd77c\/@o03B8ZRx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Pediatric cancers,Epigenetics,Methylation abnormality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18617"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akhila Parthasarathy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antje Arnold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Eberhart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Raabe<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, we have identified that CD26 is uniformly and intensely expressed in osteoclasts, while its expression in plasma cells of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) reveals heterogenous. Decreased expression levels of CD26 in MM cells are one of the mechanisms underlying resistance to humanized anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy. In the present study, we clarify the impact of epigenetic modification by HDAC inhibition (HDACi) with isoform-selective or broad inhibitors on the regulation of CD26 in MM cells and its mechanisms, thereby affecting the performance of humanized CD26mAb.<br \/><b>Methods and Results:<\/b> Immunostaining of bone marrow tissues of MM showed that CD26<sup>pos<\/sup>\/CD138<sup>pos<\/sup> plasma cells were detected in several patients but not in others. So, first, we investigated the impact of HDACi on CD26 expression of MM cells. Although the cell surface expression of CD26 was relatively low or not detected on 5 MM cell lines (KMS26, KMS27, KMS28, KMS11, RPMI8226), the increased expression in CD26 levels was detectable within 24 h of the treatment with HDAC1i; FK228, HDAC3i; BG45, MS-275, RG2833 or HDAC6i; nexturastat A, tubastatin A, ACY-1215 as well as broad HDACi; LBH-589, SAHA. It increased further and maximum increase was observed at 72 h of the treatment by each HDACi. Then, subsequent removal of HDACi resulted in a decline of CD26 expression on MM cells to pre-treated levels. In addition, the levels of CD26mRNA were concomitantly enhanced, which was paralleled with an increase in the induction of CD26 protein in MM cells. Next, we examined the effect of HDACi on the viability of CD26<sup>neg <\/sup>MM cells in the absence or presence of CD26mAb. The mAb alone did not induce lysis of CD26<sup>neg <\/sup>MM cell lines at any doses, whereas, combining HDACi plus CD26mAb (10 &#956;g\/ml) synergistically facilitated lysis of CD26<sup>neg<\/sup> MM cells via direct effects as well as NK cell-mediated ADCC by mAb. Of note, HDACi plus CD26mAb in combination readily augmented lysis of CD26<sup>neg <\/sup>cell populations, refractory to HDACi or mAb alone. Furthermore, to elucidate the mechanisms of CD26 up-regulation in MM cells by HDACi, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assay on CD26 gene promoter. Each HDACi increased acetylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27Ac), concomitant with enhanced binding of Sp1 at the 5&#8217; flanking region of the CD26 gene containing Sp1 binding sites in CD26<sup>neg<\/sup> MM cells, which is suggestive of transactivation of CD26 gene by HDACi targeting HDAC1, 3 or 6.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Combination with isoform-selective HDACi not only shows anti-MM activity but supports as immunopotentiators by sensitizing CD26<sup>neg <\/sup>MM cells to CD26mAb and augment its cytotoxicity against MM cells.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0eb7b166-a293-42c8-9d9f-58c51e9a527d\/@o03B8ZRx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Histone acetylation,Monoclonal antibodies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18618"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hiroko Nishida<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mari Fujiwara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mutsumi Hayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michiie Sakamoto<\/i><\/presenter>.

One of the most prevalent epigenetic characteristics in gastric and colorectal cancer is aberrant hypermethylation in the promoter of numerous tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethylation of the promoter inactivates tumor suppressor expression and contributes to tumor progression. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which mediate DNA hypermethylation, are putative drug targets of cancer therapy. Several DNMTs inhibitors are under development. 5&#8217;-azacytidine and decitabine have been approved for the treatment of AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, and CMML. Clinical trials investigating DNMTs inhibitors in combination with other drugs are ongoing. However, clinical use of 5&#8217;-azacytidine and decitabine has been limited due to their toxicity. We have ever demonstrated that cordycepin, a major ingredient of Chinese traditional medicine Cordyceps, has activity of DNMTs inhibition. Treating cancer cells reversed hypermethylation of some tumor suppressor genes promoter, reactivated gene expression, and inhibited cancer cell proliferation.<br \/>Here, we report the preclinical anti-cancer efficacy of Cordycepin in colorectal and gastric cancers in combination with chemotherapy drugs. In SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells derived nude mice xenograft tumor model, mice were dosed 20mg\/kg Cordycepin alone, 400mg\/kg Capecitabine alone, or in combination orally, once daily, for 14 days. Tumor Growth Inhibition rate (TGI) of 89.2% was achieved in the combination therapy group comparing to 57.8% in the 400mg\/kg Capecitabine mono-therapy group, and less than 10% in the Cordycepin alone group. Additionally, 20mg\/kg Cordycepin plus 3mg\/kg fluorouracil achieved TGI of 81.3% after 28 days of treatment in this model, comparing to 67.5% in the 6mg\/kg fluorouracil monotherapy group. In HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells derived xenograft model, 20mg\/kg Cordycepin plus 250mg\/kg Capecitabine orally dosed once daily for 14 days showed TGI of 72.6%, similar to that treated by 400mg\/kg Capecitabine alone (80.1%). 20mg\/kg Cordycepin plus 2.5mg\/kg Tegafur\/Gimeracil\/Oteracil once daily for 14 days had TGI of 76.7%, while 5mg\/kg Tegafur\/Gimeracil\/Oteracil alone treatment group had TGI of 66.1%. 20mg\/kg Cordycepin alone treatment showed only weak inhibition of tumor growth. Synergistic effects of Cordycepin and chemotherapy drugs were observed in treating both tested tumor models. Better tolerance was also shown in the combination therapy groups, as indicated by the mice body weight change. It is demonstrated that the DNMTs regulator Cordycepin has improved the anti-cancer activity and tolerance of chemotherapy drugs, such as Capecitabine, 5-FU, Tegafur\/Gimeracil\/Oteracil. Clinical development of Cordycepin and chemotherapy combination for cancer patients is strongly supported.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6f8e6586-2c79-40ba-a0ca-e751c38f9fcd\/@o03B8ZRx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methyltransferase,Colorectal cancer,Gastric cancer,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18620"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Qing Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangze Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jianyu Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Qin<\/i><\/presenter>.

By contrast, pYStat1, pYStat5, pS727Stat3, pSrc, pJanus kinase, or the induction of other signaling events are not inhibited in compound-treated cells, and normal or tumor cells that do not harbor aberrantly-active Stat3 are only weakly inhibited. <i>In vivo<\/i> delivery of H120 or H182 as a single agent inhibited growth of human TNBC xenografts, and of H278 (HCl salt of H182) combined with radiation abrogated tumor growth and improved survival in mouse TNBC syngeneic models. These studies provide novel mechanism of disruption of aberrantly-active Stat3 and its dynamics in showing that the azetidine-based Stat3 inhibitors trigger Stat3 ubiquitination, and tumor cell death. H182 and H172 are new entities for further therapeutic development against TNBC and other cancers that harbor aberrantly-active Stat3.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a0d30ee3-2d1a-4989-927f-f58c2f9b597f\/@o03B8ZRx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"STAT3,Small molecule inhibitor,Breast cancer,Antitumor agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18621"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peibin Yue<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco Lopez-Tapia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yinsong Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nagendra Verma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felix Alonso-Valenteen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simoun Mikhael<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lali Medina-Kauwe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus Tius<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Turkson<\/i><\/presenter>.

These patients receive targeted therapy targeting EGFR mutation. To date all approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are ATP competitive inhibitors, inevitably lead to drug resistance and to disease progress. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR TKI that selectively inhibits both EGFR TKI-sensitizing (L858R) mutation and T790M mutation that confers acquired resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. The patients develop secondary resistance L858R\/C797S and L858R\/T790M\/C797S to this treatment in some cases. There have been strong unmet needs for specific therapies targeting C797S resistance mutations. Additionally, toxicities caused by inhibition of wild-type (WT) EGFR are frequently reported with the first-generation inhibitors (e.g. Gefitinib and Erlotinib). Our Compound A is a highly mutant-selective fourth-generation allosteric inhibitor that targets L858 activating mutations and without affecting EGFR WT that compares favorably with all ATP competitive inhibitors, indicating that it might avoid potential toxicities from targeting EGFR WT. Compound A has a single-digit nanomolar potency against L858R activating mutation and those harboring T790M and C797S resistance mutations. Oral administration of Compound A to tumor-bearing mice showed significant antitumor activity as a single-agent at well-tolerated doses via inhibiting EGFR pathway in the engineered osimertinib-resistance EGFR<sup>L858R\/T790M\/C797S<\/sup> and EGFR<sup>L858R\/C797S<\/sup> CDX models. Furthermore, Compound A demonstrated excellent efficacy in EGFR<sup>L858R\/T790M<\/sup> CDX model as a single-agent. Collectively, Compound A has a robust potency against L858R activating mutations including T790M, C797S, and T790M\/C797S that cause acquired resistance to ATP competitive EGFR TKIs <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Based on the preclinical data, Compound A is a potent, orally available, and mutant-selective fourth-generation allosteric inhibitor of EGFR with L858R activating mutations for the treatment of NSCLC, suggesting that it might have the potential to demonstrate activity in the first line and resistance settings as a single agent. The pre-clinical data described here supports the clinical development of Compound A in NSCLC patients with L858R activating mutations of EGFR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3015973f-9e2a-43db-bc18-0d027d14fc4b\/@p03B8ZRy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Non-small cell lung cancer,Allosteric inhibitor,Osimertinib-resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18622"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yeji Byeon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Hee Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daseul Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seock Yong Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiyeon Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyeim Jo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seong-Il Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Somyi Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung-chul Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Hun Tae<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Min Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung-Yup Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soyeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donghyun Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Kyu Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Wan Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Changes in tumor size and oral mucositis symptoms (toluidine-blue positive) were analyzed on the sacrifice day. In addition, changes in the amount of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) increased by tumor and cisplatin, and changes in related active factors were quantitatively analyzed.<br \/><b>Result: <\/b>Compared to the positive control group, the tumor size was reduced by 42% in the group treated with EC-18 alone (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05).

In the positive control group, feed rate and body weight gradually decreased after about 12 days. Also, in the cisplatin-treated group, feed rate and body weight decreased rapidly after six days. On the other hand, in the group treated with EC-18 alone, there was no decrease in body weight and diet, and in the treatment with cisplatin, the diet and body weight gradually recovered after 14 days. Unlike the occurrence of oral mucositis symptoms independent of tumor growth inhibition by cisplatin, simultaneous treatment with EC-18 recovered oral mucositis symptoms along with the reduction of tumor growth (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05).

Myc dysregulation have been directly linked to the poor clinical outcome in these cancers. Therefore, it is highly warranted to discover and develop novel Myc therapeutical agents for targeting Myc driven cancers. Here we described GT19630, a GSPT1\/Myc CELMoD. GT19630 was discovered through an SAR effort for c-Myc degrader by using c-Myc ELISA and Western blot assays in c-Myc driven HL60 AML cells. GT19630 selectively degraded c-Myc proteins in HL60 cells (IC50=1.5 nM) as compared to growth-factor regulated c-Myc erythroid progenitor cells (TF-1 cells) with IC50=52.5 nM. GT19630 also selectively inhibited HL60 cell proliferation (IC50= 0.33 nM), as compared to its IC50 (26.2 nM) in GM-CSF-TF-1 proliferation, as well as in bone marrow colony-forming cell assays (myeloid=40.2 nM), suggesting&#62;100X selectivity for HL60 cells over normal blood cells. Through the SAR for Myc degrader, GT19630 has been evolved as a leading molecule sharing chemical properties to CELMoDs. Therefore, this compound was further evaluated by proteomics and western blot, GT19630 was confirmed to selective degradation of CELMoD targets, GSPT1\/GSPT2 (translation termination factor G1 to S phase transition proteins 1 and 2) with IC90&#60;1 nM and CK1 alpha (IC90&#60;10 nM), but not IKZF1\/Ikaros. In silico modeling of GT19630 was performed in the DDB1&#8722;CRBN&#8722;CC-885&#8722;GSPT1 complex and confirmed the docking similarity with CELMoDs. Further, GT19630 inhibited the cell proliferation with IC50&#60;10 nM in 74% B-cell malignant cell lines (20\/27) bearing deregulated c-Myc and in 79% of SCLC cell lines (4\/19) carrying deregulated Myc (c-Myc, N-Myc or L-Myc) tested. Moreover, GT19630 completely degraded Myc proteins in AML, lymphoma and multiple myeloma (c-Myc) and SCLC (c-Myc and N-Myc) xenograft tumors at the lowest dose of 1.0 mg\/kg and induced complete tumor regression (lowest dose=0.3 mg\/kg) tested. Furthermore, this compound eradicated lymphoma cells in Daudi-induced liquid lymphoma mouse models. In addition, GT19630, as a potent GSPT1\/Myc CELMoD, demonstrated an even-driven pharmacology in vivo and induced complete tumor regression with a dosing regimen of 3 day on\/7 day off. Remarkably, GT19630 selectively degraded Myc proteins in HL60 and DMS114 SCLC xenograft tumors as compared to a much less potency at degrading c-Myc in rat spleen. Finally, GT19630 demonstrated favorable PK and safety profiles (an 8-fold safety therapeutic windows) with no effect on myeloid lineages in rats at the dose of 6 mg\/kg for 14 days, indicating GT19630 lacks myelosuppression as reported for other CELMoDs. Currently, GT19630 has been advanced into IND enabling stage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/70500df1-f31b-4ad9-9acb-e61b7ce28792\/@p03B8ZRy\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"c-Myc,GSTP1,Cereblon E3 ligase modulators ,Blood cancers and SCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18624"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liandong Ma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youzhi Tong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaohui Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qianxiang Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongha Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ru Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huiyuan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiangwei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yini Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Nishida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Andreeff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qilnli Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Nishida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Andreeff<\/i><\/presenter>.

AA is a natural product and the main active principle of <i>Aristolochia<\/i> plants, a known source of antitumor agents. In 1964 due to nephrotoxicity, drug development efforts with AA were terminated following Phase I clinical trial in patients with terminal cancer of different origin. Structure activity studies of AA species allowed us to select a structural analog of AA (RJ-34) that lacks the determinants responsible for the renal toxicity and carcinogenicity of the parent compound. Building further on our experience with AA molecules, we developed a synthetic approach that affords efficient high-yield synthesis of RJ-34. Its structure and purity has been confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography coupled with two-stage mass spectrometry and high resolution nucleic magnetic resonance. Sulforhodamine B assay revealed that RJ-34 has growth inhibitory activity in A549 and HCT-15 human cancer cell lines comparable to or stronger than that of paclitaxel or topotecan. At five nanomolar, RJ-34 inhibited DNA synthesis and cut the growth of A549 cells by 50%, leading to cell cycle arrest in G1\/M and G2\/S, with apparent apoptosis at concentrations greater than 200 nanomolar. Notably, protein synthesis in cultured cells, as evaluated by puromycin labelling, remained unaffected. RJ-34 was screened against the NCI-60 cell line panel - encompassing sixty human cancer cell lines from various tissues - providing clues to its mechanisms of action; namely, that RJ-34 acts through inhibition of DNA topoisomerases I and II and\/or DNA intercalation. Follow-up studies using purified calf Topo I and human Topo II alpha and various plasmid substrates confirmed the role of RJ-34 as a DNA intercalator and human Topoisomerase II alpha poison. The pattern of activity of RJ-34 in the NCI-60 panel was distinct from that of AA and aristolactam - another related compound - suggesting that RJ-34 acts by mechanisms distinct from AA. In summary, RJ-34&#8212; a non-nephrotoxic analog of aristolochic acid&#8212; has a potent growth inhibitory activity in various human cancer cell lines with a mechanism of action different from the parent AA. Moving forward, pre-clinical pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy studies are necessary to establish the potential of RJ-34 for development as an anticancer therapeutic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fb919da2-44b7-404b-b3e2-d09d0e0dcde1\/@p03B8ZRy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural products,A549 cells,Target discovery,Antitumor agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18625"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Keiji Hashimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajesh Chennamshetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Radha Bonala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francis Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arthur P.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 is a an oncogene that has been implicated in many human cancers. We report that the hirsutinolide natural product, R001, blocks STAT3 DNA-binding activty <i>in vitro<\/i>. Treatment with R001 of the human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 led to the concurrent inhibition of constitutively-active STAT3 and the expression and activities of glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (G6PD) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)1, early suppression of glutathione (GSH), and the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which peaked at 6-24 h post R001-treatment. In the short term, R001-treated TNBC cells showed evidence of pyroptotic cell death. Prolonged treatment of TNBC cells with R001 led to DNA damage and G2\/M-phase cell cycle arrest, which are late-stage responses that were preceded by the suppression of ATM-Chk2-Cdc25c pathway, and the induction of p21 and &#947;H2AX phosphorylation by the natural product. Accordingly, R001 suppressed the viable cell numbers, colony formation, growth in 3D-matrigel, and the migration of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. The oral administration of R001 at 5 mg\/kg signficantly inhibited growth of human MDA-MB-468 xenografts in mice. Results together show that R001 inhibits STAT3, G6PD and TrxR1 functions that lead to early oxidative stress and pyroptosis and late-stage DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, which collectively cause tumor cell death and tumor growth inhibition in human TNBC models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71698ee8-c276-4bc1-a497-cd7639c7fbb5\/@p03B8ZRy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"STAT3,Natural products,Breast cancer,Antitumor agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18627"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yinsong Zhu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cody F.

CAP-0121 DNA damage, like other illudofulvenes, can only be recognized and repaired by the Transcription-Coupled Repair pathway, and is ignored by the Global Genome Repair Pathway. The first generation illudofulvene, irofulven, displayed significant activity in clinical trials against ovarian, prostate and hepatocellular tumors. While irofulven has proven to be a potent antitumor agent against drug-resistant tumors, its efficacy is limited by hematologic toxicity that reduced the maximum dosage that can be administered to patients. CAP-0121 is as cytotoxic, or even more cytotoxic, than irofulven when tested in the NCI 60 cell line panel. Despite this increased cytotoxicity noted <i>in vitro<\/i>, CAP-0121 is less toxic to animals and the maximum tolerated dose is approximately 3 times higher than irofulven (mg\/kg basis). CAP-0121 also retains activity against multidrug resistant cell lines including MRP1 and MDR1 expressing variants. As a result CAP-0121 is capable of inducing tumor remission in MDR xenograft models that are unresponsive to 35 conventional and experimental agents, and in which irofulven is only capable of slowing the rate of tumor growth. This response of CAP-0121 in drug resistant xenografts is observed at nontoxic doses.

Based on our expanding knowledge of RNA biology, RNA deregulation has drawn much attention from the perspective of cancer therapy. Indeed, small molecules that attack the RNA maturation processes and produce aberrant RNA are currently under development.<br \/>The first step in gene expression is transcription, which involves copying a DNA sequence to make an RNA. Transcription is performed by enzymes called RNA polymerase (Pol II) that links nucleotides to form RNA strand. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II comprises heptapeptide Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7 repeats and is dynamically post-translationally phosphorylated to regulate the distinct stages of transcription initiation, elongation and termination steps. Particularly, Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation have the closest association with the regulation of transcription. Therefore, we focus on the kinases that carry out this modification.<br \/>Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family of serine\/threonine protein kinases. CDK12 regulates the elongation step of RNA transcription by phosphorylation of Ser2 on the CTD. CDK12 complexes with cyclin K to promote the elongation of transcripts, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, involved in DNA damage responses. It is expected that the inhibition of CDK12 have a synergistic effect with PARP inhibitors and chemotherapeutic reagents.<br \/>Here we present data on CRD-1835439, orally available, selective, and first in class CDK12 inhibitor with optimized drug-properties. Biochemically, CRD-1835439 is more than 300-fold selective over other CDK isoforms such as CDK7 and CDK9. Importantly, cell based assays showed CRD-1835439 has selective inhibitory activity for phosphorylation of Ser2 on the CTD but not for other Ser5 and Ser7 phosphorylation. Comprehensive analysis by PolyA-seq, Chip-seq and RNA-seq revealed that CRD-1835439 inhibits transcriptional elongation on DNA damage response genes including BRCA1 and BRCA2. The effects on DNA damage and repair were assessed by immunofluorescence staining for &#947;H2AX and RAD51 proteins. In vivo, oral treatment with CRD-1835439 in cell line derived xenograft models, resulted in increase of DNA damage biomarkers, induction of apoptosis and tumor regressions in a dose-dependent fashion. Besides the efficacy as a single reagent, the efficacy was augmented when CRD-1835439 was combined with PARP inhibitors in in vitro and in vivo.<br \/>In summary, the novel small-molecule CDK12 inhibitor CRD-1835439 demonstrated preclinical efficacy along with target engagement. Our results underscore the preclinical therapeutic potential of CRD-1835439 as a single-agent or in combination with PARP inhibitors for the treatment of intractable cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e1168e4e-bba1-4ee2-98fb-d32ef570ed2a\/@p03B8ZRy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Transcriptional regulation,CDK inhibitor,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18630"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hiroko Yamakawa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akio Mizutani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuyoshi Arikawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunsuke Ebara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshihiko Satoh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daisuke Morishita<\/i><\/presenter>.

Damage associated molecular patterns, e.g. damaged genomic DNA, released from injured cancer cells can be converted into 2&#8217;, 3&#8217;-cGAMP by cGAS. Subsequently, cGAMP triggers STING pathway activation to produce type I interferons (IFNs) and other related innate immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase\/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1), a membrane-bound nucleotide hydrolase, has been discovered as the predominant enzyme hydrolyzing 2&#8217;3&#8217;-cGAMP (Li, et al). Hence, ENPP1 blockade in the tumor milieu is a potential strategy against tumors by improving innate immunity response. In this report, we present a potent ENPP1 inhibitor ZX-8177. ZX-8177 showed an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 9.5 nM in a biochemical assay and an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 11 nM in MDA-MB-231 cell-based enzymatic assay. In a functional assay for evaluating efficacy of ZX-8177, the production of IFN-&#946;1 by THP-1 cells was measured after the cells were cultured in the conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with or without ZX-8177. The interferon production assay showed an EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 15 pM, suggesting that ZX-8177 effectively facilitated IFN-&#946;1 production via cGAMP-STING axis. In CT-26 syngeneic mouse model, ZX-8177 treatment at 2 mg\/kg, BID for 14 days can achieve around 37-60% tumor growth inhibition (TGI). No body weight loss was observed during treatment. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that ZX-8177 treatment resulted in a 2-3-fold increase in tumor-infiltrating NK (CD314+CD335+) cells, cytotoxic CD8 T cells (GranzB+CD8+), and M1-macrophages (CD206-MHCII+); and a decrease in M2-macrophages (CD206+MHCII-) (p&#60; 0.05). Combination of Mitomycin C (0.5 mg\/kg, i.p., BIW) and ZX-8177 (2 mg\/kg, i.p., BID) in CT-26 model yielded synergistic anti-tumor efficacy (increased &#62;30% TGI). The level of cGAMP in tumor tissue harvested from the combination treatment group was around 2-fold higher than that in the vehicle group. Furthermore, synergistic tumor inhibition of ZX-8177 and anti-PD-L1 antibody was also observed in MC38 mouse model. TGI of anti-PD-L1 antibody vs. combo treatment is 53% vs. 75%, p &#60; 0.05. ZX-8177 has a favorable DMPK and safety pharmacology profile to support it as a clinical candidate for further development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d5810056-b64f-4f37-8472-b79a98dc06ef\/@q03B8ZRz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Tumor microenvironment,Therapeutics,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18631"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ying-ying Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyuan Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuaijun Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kun Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deming Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaomin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuning Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siyu Shui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinfu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolin Alan Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoli (Shelley) Qin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) represents an important strategy to reduce recurrence and prolong survival for gastric cancer. However, non-targeted cytotoxic drugs capable of enhancing radiosensitization remain the main choice to be combined with radiotherapy, which has limited the anti-tumor efficacy of CRT by off-target side effects. Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) is a highly potent anti-tubulin agent and has been reported to act as an effective radiosensitizer recently. Kita-Kyushu lung cancer antigen 1 (KK-LC-1) is a cancer\/testis antigen highly and exclusively expressed in multiple types of cancers including gastric cancer, representing a promising target for drug delivery. Previously, we identified a KKLC-1-targeting cyclic nonapeptide (1131 peptide) by screening a phage display peptide library. Here, we described a novel peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) 1131-MMAE by connecting the 1131 peptide with MMAE via a protease-sensitive linker for tumor-selective radiosensitization. We demonstrated that 1131-MMAE could be efficiently internalized by gastric cancer cells through KKLC1-mediating endocytosis and exhibited a comparable cytotoxicity profile with free MMAE. 1131-MMAE could arrest the cell cycle at the most radiosensitive G2\/M phase in a dose-dependent manner and selectively enhance the radiation response of KK-LC-1 positive gastric cancer cells by increasing DNA double-strand break as indicated by &#947;H2Ax immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore,1131-MMAE was able to inhibit tumor growth as a monotherapy at 2mg\/kg with a good safety profile <i>in vivo<\/i>. Increased tumor control was achieved when 1131-MMAE was combined with radiotherapy at a relatively low dose of 0.3mg\/kg. Overall, we proposed an MMAE-based PDC targeting a novel tumor marker KK-LC-1 and demonstrated its tumor-selective radiosensitization in gastric cancer models for the first time. This anti-KKLC1 PDC may help to promote the clinical progress in precision chemoradiotherapy for multiple types of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e011be92-c76a-4749-88f0-24fff86bcb66\/@q03B8ZRz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted drug delivery,peptide-drug conjugate,Radiosensitization,Kita-Kyushu lung cancer antigen 1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18632"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaotong Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fangcen Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoxiao Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiayao Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baorui Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

As such, many cancers are reliant on elevated polyamine levels that are maintained through dysregulated polyamine metabolism. Polyamine metabolism is thus a promising target for cancer therapeutics, and modulation of polyamine metabolism has been attempted with numerous enzyme inhibitors and polyamine analogues. SBP-101 (diethyl dihydroxyhomospermine) is a novel spermine analogue that has shown efficacy in slowing pancreatic tumor progression both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Here we determined the effect of SBP-101 treatment on polyamine metabolism in a variety of cancer cell types <i>in vitro<\/i> including lung, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic and breast. We evaluated the activity of four enzymes involved in the polyamine pathway following treatment with either SBP-101 or the well-characterized spermine analogue, BENSpm (N<sup>1<\/sup>,N<sup>11<\/sup>-bisethylnorspermine). Additionally, we determined by high performance liquid chromatography the effect of SBP-101 on intracellular polyamine pools and the accumulation of the analogue itself. The activity of the biosynthetic enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and the catabolic enzymes spermidine\/spermine-N-(1)-acetyltransferase and spermine oxidase were determined with and without treatment with the polyamine analogues. SBP-101 treatment resulted in a varying increase in the activity of polyamine catabolic enzymes in a subset of tested cell lines, while it downregulated the activity of the biosynthetic enzyme ODC across all cell types studied. These results indicate that SBP-101 likely exerts its effect predominately through decreased polyamine biosynthesis with minor upregulation of catabolism in contrast to the structurally similar BENSpm where the increase in polyamine catabolism is the predominant response. A sustained elevation of polyamine levels plays a role in the immunosuppressive environment of some cold tumors, and the pharmacologic and genetic modulation of polyamine metabolism has demonstrated success in reducing immunosuppressive phenotypes. Therefore, to extend our in vitro results, we evaluated the efficacy of SBP-101 in the immunosuppressive VDID8<sup>+<\/sup> murine ovarian cancer model. SBP-101 caused a marked increase in median survival comparable to that of some promising combination therapies. Future studies will determine the synergistic effects, if any, of SBP-101 in combination with other polyamine metabolism modulators as well as with immune modulators.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/270e350a-7467-487e-8beb-710fa55619ea\/@q03B8ZRz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polyamines,Drug mechanism,Pancreatic cancer,Polyamine analogue,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18633"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cassandra E.

Bioinformatics analysis of cell screen data and correlation to publicly available datasets can support identification of appropriate patient populations for subsequent preclinical and clinical development. BOLD-100 is a first-in-class ruthenium-based anticancer agent currently being tested in a Phase 1b \/ 2a clinical trial in combination with FOLFOX in the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal cancers. BOLD-100 works by altering the unfolded protein response through selective GRP78 inhibition; and inducing reactive oxygen species which causes DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these result in cell death in a range of different cancer types, and in combination with many different classes of anticancer agents. To determine optimal indications for BOLD-100 development, BOLD-100 was tested against 316 cancer cell lines in 72-hour Cell Titer Glo assays with downstream bioinformatic analysis and validation experiments. Multiple cancer types showed preferential response to BOLD-100, including bladder, esophageal, pancreatic, multiple myeloma and ovarian cancers. Subtype analysis identified potential populations of increased responsiveness, including in bladder cancer where BOLD-100 had increased response in luminal and mixed subtypes, as compared to basal subtypes. Utilizing bladder cancer as a case study, subsequent combination testing of BOLD-100 in combination with fluorouracil or cisplatin demonstrated that BOLD-100 enhanced cell death across different bladder cancer cell lines through synergistic interactions with these standard-of-care agents. The pan-cancer response profile of BOLD-100 was compared against 449 other anticancer drug responses that are part of the GDSC database. BOLD-100 displayed limited correlation with existing drugs, suggesting a unique mechanism of action and clinical utility where standard-of-care agents have limited efficacy. Pharmacogenomic analysis of the cell screen data indicated potential pathways and genes of relevance to BOLD-100 response, including increased response in KRAS-mutant cancers. Collectively, BOLD-100 showed a unique sensitivity profile across a panel of over 300 cancer cell lines, identifying multiple potential indications for future development. Subsequent investigations into several cancer types of interest and drug combinations are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f3e79cea-d32d-4c22-b637-14c7bc74d77c\/@q03B8ZRz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug-discovery screen,Pharmacogenomics,Synergism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18634"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Paromita Raha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Carie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Pankovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mark Bazett<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In general, p53- pathway-restoring can be achieved by small molecules through p53-dependent or p53-independent ways. For short, hereafter p53-independent restoration of p53-pathway-signaling is also referred as &#8216;restoration of p53 pathway&#8217;. To perform a comparative activation of p53 target genes, novel compounds PG3 and PG3-Oc that activate a subset of p53-target genes in a p53-independent manner, and four known mutant p53-activating compounds were included (ZMC1, APR-246, CP-31398 and Ellipticine). Nutlin-3a was used as a negative control. PG3 and PG3-Oc induced significant upregulation of p21, PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), and DR5 consistently in five tested cancer cell lines with various p53 status through ATF4 (Activating transcriptional factor 4) <i>via<\/i> the ISR in a p53-independent manner. However, mutant p53-targeting compounds induced the expression of the three p53 target genes and ATF4 in a highly variable and cell type-dependent manner. PG3 treatment activated ATF4 through the ISR via kinase HRI (Heme-regulated inhibitor). ATF4 mediated the upregulation of PUMA, p21 and NAG-1 (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene 1). We identified PUMA-mediated cell apoptosis through activation of caspase-8 in HT29 cells and possibly caspase-10 in SW480 cells. In summary, we provide a new mechanism that PG3 induced cell death via an HRI\/ATF4\/PUMA axis that may be helpful in understanding drug efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/663aecd6-464a-473d-a274-2a2213a0312e\/@q03B8ZRz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Restore p53 pathway,Integrated Stress Response (ISR),Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18635"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"4f0d8ebb-fa7b-4dcb-a989-7cd630d86e01","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f0d8ebb-fa7b-4dcb-a989-7cd630d86e01\/@q03B8ZRz\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaobing Tian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wafik S.

SF mutations are heterozygous and largely mutually exclusive, suggesting synthetic lethality of multiple SFs mutations and also providing a rationale of targeting SFs for new drug development, particularly in SF-mutated cancers. To show proof-of-concept for this, we have recently developed an orally available and highly potent CLK inhibitor, CTX-712, and evaluated its anti-leukemic activities both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. CTX-712 potently suppressed phosphorylation of major SR domain-containing SFs. When tested in human myeloid cell lines (K562 and MV-4-11), it showed a strong inhibitory effect on cell proliferation (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=0.15 and 0.036 &#956;M, respectively). The anti-leukemic effect was also confirmed by survival assay using a total of 79 primary AML cells (the average of IC<sub>50<\/sub> was 0.078 &#956;M). In addition, CTX-712 suppressed phosphorylation of multiple SR proteins including SRSF2\/3\/4\/6. RNA-seq analysis revealed that CTX-712 induced global splicing changes, which typically resulted in exon exclusion (exon skipping) of cassette exon. We observed that the degree of splicing (percent spliced-in value) in cassette exon events induced by the drug was positively correlated with the sensitivity to the drug (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) in primary AML cells (N=32, <i>R<\/i>=0.61, <i>P<\/i>=0.00018), suggesting that the degree of splicing changes after drug treatment could still be a biomarker of efficacy of CTX-712.<br \/>To further investigate the effect of CTX-712 on tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>, we established 13 subcutaneous models of MDS\/AML-derived xenografts (PDX), which were treated with varying doses of CTX-712. Interestingly, PDX with larger splicing changes showed a stronger tumor inhibition than those with smaller splicing changes. We observed a correlation between the degree of splicing changes induced by CTX-712 and the drug sensitivity (tumor growth inhibition) although it was not significant (N=13, <i>R<\/i>=-0.51, <i>P<\/i>=0.077). In particular, the PDX with the largest splicing changes showed a significant response to CTX-712 in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, 4 out of 5 mice treated using a high dose protocol (12.5 mg\/kg) achieved complete remission (the tumor shrank completely to unmeasurable size).

PHI-501 is a novel small molecule inhibitor intended for the treatment of AML in patients expressing the N-RAS activating mutation. PHI-501 presented higher selectivity within a panel of 355 protein kinases. PHI-501 exerts their anti-proliferative effects by inducing apoptosis and G0-G1 arrest and significantly induce apoptotic markers (cleaved PARP and caspase 3) in both Ba\/F3-NRAS-G12D and OCI-AML3 cells. The results of Western blot analysis showed that PHI-501 attenuate phosphorylation of p70S6K1, AKT, and p38 in OCI-AML3 After 21 days of the treatment in subcutaneous OCI-AML3 human AML xenograft model, PHI-501 showed significant inhibition of tumor growth (TGI) in a dose-dependent manner. Compared to the vehicle group, the 40 mg\/kg group demonstrated a 74.0% lower average tumor volume (P&#60;0.0001) and a 78.5% lower average tumor weight (P=0.0041). No significant body weight changes were observed in any of the groups. In toxicology and pharmacokinetic study, PHI-501 exhibited pharmacokinetic profiles favorable for oral administration in rodent, dog, and monkey and displayed acceptable in vivo and in vitro safety profiles.

Several PI3K inhibitors are approved for treatment of CLL, but PI3K inhibitor-induced alterations in T cell function have been correlated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Zandelisib is a novel selective PI3K&#948; inhibitor in clinical development with an intermittent dosing schedule for treatment of B cell malignancies. Here, we investigated the dynamic immunomodulatory properties of zandelisib alone or in combination with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in normal human T cells, as well as the impact of continuous dosing of zandelisib on effector and regulatory immune cells, irAEs, and survival in a preclinical CLL murine model. Normal human T cells treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with zandelisib, ibrutinib, or both were assessed for phenotype and function. A CLL model was initiated by transferring leukemic E&#956;TCL1 splenocytes into syngeneic wildtype recipients. CLL-bearing mice were treated with vehicle or zandelisib (50 mpk bid or 100 mpk qd) for 3 weeks (n=5 per group). Antitumor efficacy, T cell and myeloid subsets in blood, bone marrow and spleen were analyzed. Survival was also observed in a separate cohort of mice treated with zandelisib (100 mpk qd). T cell proliferation was impaired by zandelisib (250nM) and ibrutinib (100 nM) alone, with the combination further reducing T cell proliferation. Zandelisib decreased expression of suppressive markers PD-1, CTLA-4, GITR and CD39 on iTregs; however, no further decrease was observed when zandelisib was combined with ibrutinib. Zandelisib also reduced normal T cell activation and expression of immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4 on CD4+ T cells and dose dependently inhibited T cell memory differentiation <i>ex vivo<\/i>, increasing the na&#239;ve\/central to effector memory ratio. Combination with ibrutinib did not further affect T cell activation, checkpoint expression or memory differentiation. In the CLL murine model, no meaningful difference was seen between bid or qd administration of zandelisib in the reduction of tumor burden (CD19+ CD5+ CLL cells). Zandelisib treatment reduced activated T cells, antigen-experienced T cells, and Tregs. Increased na&#239;ve\/central to effector memory ratio was observed in treated mice, and PD-1 was downregulated on memory T cells, indicating less T cell exhaustion. Zandelisib decreased macrophages in the spleen but did not impact myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Zandelisib treatment improved survival of CLL-bearing mice significantly when compared to vehicle group (median survival of zandelisib group 140 days vs. 105 days vehicle). In conclusion, zandelisib treatment reduced Tregs, prevented terminal memory differentiation, and T-cell exhaustion&#8212;features that have been shown to permit CLL immune evasion&#8212;demonstrated antitumor efficacy, and improved overall survival in a preclinical CLL model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/574e0430-4fe1-4b64-b07d-1de8761e5522\/@r03B8ZRA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,PI3K,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18641"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kamira Maharaj<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie Mediavilla-Varela<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John J.

Aggressive, diffuse invasion is regulated by a dynamic cytoskeleton and significantly contributes to poor survival. Intraparenchymal tumor cell dissemination prevents complete surgical resection and compromises essential brain functions. Invasive cells are inherently less sensitive to traditional cytotoxic therapies. Recent investigation into targeted therapies has failed to address invasion\/cytoskeleton based GBM therapy resistance. Furthermore, established GBM cell line modeling in 2 or 3 dimensions (3D) does not capture the genetic diversity or clinical relevance of patient derived primary (1') GBM cell lines, which may uncover\/predict differential responses in tumors to novel therapies. Cytoskeleton remodeling and cell invasion in patient-derived primary GBM cells generates unique structures called tumor microtubes (TMs) not seen in established, cultured GBM cell lines. TMs are ultralong, pro-invasive, tubulin-enriched protrusions that promote chemo- and radioresistance in GBM patient derived primary cells. Using our extensive GBM cell line biobank derived from 1' and\/or therapy resistant recurrent (2') tumors, we investigated the effects of a novel drug targeting the microtubule cytoskeleton. Plinabulin is a tubulin targeting agent that crosses the blood brain barrier and demonstrated anticancer efficacy in Phase III trial patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. Plinabulin also has antiproliferative properties in 2D GBM cells. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of plinabulin treatment upon 3D neurosphere viability and invasion in 5 GBM 1' and 2' recurrent patient derived cell lines. Within 24h of matrigel embedding, 3D GBM patient neurospheres generate robust pro-invasive TMs. Plinabulin treatment (10-30 nM) at embedding followed by drug washout after 24h eliminated existing TMs and inhibited single cell invasion (&#38;gt;80% relative to controls) in both 1' and 2' GBM patient neurospheres. Cell survival was significantly reduced in plinabulin treated neurospheres (&#38;gt;30 nM). Plinabulin efficacy was evaluated in a clinically relevant therapeutic ITR model: GBM patient neurospheres invaded (I) for 48h to establish TM networks; were treated (T) with 1-50 nM plinabulin for 24h prior to drug washout; and recovered (R) for 96h. In 1', 2', or matched 1' and 2' cell line pairs from the same patient, 10-40 nM plinabulin sustained invasion inhibition (&#38;gt;90%) through 96h post washout and completely blocked TM extension relative to controls, consistent with established clinical concentrations of plinabulin. This study reveals plinabulin as a potent GBM therapeutic targeting pro-invasion TM networks and survival in 1' and therapy resistant 2' GBM patient cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/773bea5c-7ec9-4073-956b-962f2face1aa\/@r03B8ZRA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-10 Tubulin agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Invasion,Tubulin,Tumor invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18643"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kathryn M.

Secondary endpoints included 1-year, 3-year, as well as 5-year OS rates, and the DFS according to the BIM mutation status (mutant-type and wild-type) and EGFR mutation types (19 del and 21 L858R).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Between March 2014 and January 2018, 79 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up time was 39.7 months with a median DFS and overall survival (OS) of 41.4 months (95% CI: 33.6-51.8) and 67.0 months (95% CI: 21.2-not reached [NR]), respectively. The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year OS rates were 100%, 83.3%, and 61.7%, respectively. No significant difference was found in the median DFS between patients with Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) mutant-type and wild-type (NR vs. 41.7 months; <i>p<\/i>=0.75) and no significant difference was found in the median DFS according to EGFR mutation types (all <i>p<\/i>&#62;0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The phase II ICAPE study demonstrated that 1.5-year adjuvant therapy with icotinib had a favorable survival benefit in patients with stage IIA-IIIA EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma with a long median DFS and high 5-year OS rates which is consistent with other icotinib&#8217;s study. Icotinib is suggested to be used as an adjuvant therapy option in IIA-IIIA EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f5a5800c-f0f3-4897-9cf3-128c361fedfa\/@r03B8ZRA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),Adjuvant,Adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18644"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kun Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bin Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zi-Tong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua-Gang Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhi-Yong Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Shang Cui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li-Jun Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yi Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

PTP4A3 promotes cell migration, survival, metabolism, angiogenesis, and tumor formation, which are mediated at least partly by PTP4A3&#8217;s ability to function as a positive signal transducer capable of activating STAT3 and ERK1\/2. We found KVX-053 inhibited the migration and, at higher concentrations, the viability of chemosensitive and chemoresistant human ovarian cancer cell lines <i>in vitro. <\/i>Using an established ovarian cancer metastasis prevention model in which taxane-resistant SKOV3TRip2 cells were injected <i>i.p.<\/i> followed by four treatments with 20 mg\/kg KVX-053, we observed a median survival of 68 days compared to the median survival of 58 days in the vehicle treated mice. We also observed a statistically significant reduction in the number of tumor implantation sites with KVX-053 treatment. Since drug resistance frequently occurs with targeted cancer therapies, we next generated A2780 and OVCAR4 ovarian cancer cells that were 32- and 4-fold resistant to KVX-053, respectively. This was accomplished by using stepwise increased compound exposure over a 3-4 month period to probe acquired cellular resistance changes caused by KVX-053. The resulting KVX-053-resistant cells had similar <i>in vitro<\/i> growth rates with the wildtype cells and retained resistance to KVX-053 for at least one month when grown in the absence of the small molecule inhibitor. They were not cross-resistant to paclitaxel, cisplatin or teniposide but were cross-resistant to chemical analogs of KVX-053. The KVX-053-resistant A2780 cells exhibited a 95% decrease in the activated form of STAT3, Y<sup>705<\/sup> phospho-STAT3, and a 57% decrease in the phosphorylation of a second activation site S<sup>727<\/sup> without any marked differences in the total STAT3 levels. In contrast, phospho-ERK1\/2 and total ERK1\/2 were elevated in the ovarian cancer cells with stable resistance to KVX-053. These results further confirm the <i>in vivo<\/i> activity of KVX-053 against ovarian cancer and suggest that chronic KVX-053 exposure disrupts the PTP4A3\/STAT3 and PTP4A3\/ERK cellular signaling pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ff718d4-12ef-4442-bc75-8ea0f5c0bed9\/@r03B8ZRA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phosphorylation,,Small molecule inhibitor,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18645"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John S.

DZB has similar potency against colony-stimulating factor receptor-1 (CSF1R); a protein important in the function of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs). M2-TAMs cause an immunosuppressive environment in solid tumors that decrease the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors, and promote angiogenesis and metastasis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Proliferating mouse macrophage cells (RAW264.7) and human tumor cells (GDM1 and DEL) were pre-treated for 1h with compounds. Cells were treated with\/out CSF1 (10ng\/ml) for 5min, lysed and analyzed by western blot. Images were quantified using the EvolutionCapt program. Murine 4T1 breast tumor cells were grown orthotopically in syngeneic Balb\/c mice, Karpass299 lymphoma cells s.c. in CB17\/Scid mice, and gastric (GA0119) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC6604)-PDX in athymic Balb\/c mice. One 4T1 experiment used stably transfected luciferased (4T1-Luc) cells. DZB (65-75 mg\/kg) and another FGFR-inhibitor, pemigatinib (1 mg\/kg) were dosed daily, orally, and the murine PDL1-Antibody (PDL1-Ab) was dosed at 5-10 mg\/kg, i.p., 2qw. Efficacy was assessed as a dT\/C, and metastases were determined by counting nodules and\/or bioluminescence ex vivo.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>DZB inhibited p-CSF1R in cultured cells with mean&#177;SEM IC50s of 307, &#60;500, 54nM for RAW264.7, GDM1, DEL cells, respectively. These IC50s were similar to the potency of DZB against the HeLa cell-line transiently infected with FGFR2 (107nM), thus confirming kinase assays that indicated similar sensitivity of FGFR1-3 and CSF1R to DZB. Other FGFR-inhibitors, including pemigatinib, which has no CSF1R activity, were without significant effect. In 3 tumor xenograft models with reported expression\/amplification of CSF1R, DZB had a mild inhibitory effect (&#916;T\/C=0.67&#177;0.05), while pemigatinib had no efficacy (&#916;T\/C=1.02&#177;0.16); mean&#177;SEM. However, in these xenografts we were unable to detect p-CSF1R. In the FGFR-driven syngeneic tumor-model, 4T1, DZB was highly efficacious causing tumor-stasis. The PDL1-Ab was without efficacy in this model, but in combination with DZB, increased efficacy against the primary tumor, and more strongly against the liver and lung metastases. PD-analyses are ongoing to explore the mechanism of this interaction.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> DZB is a potent inhibitor of CSF1R in vitro. In combination with a murine PDL1-Ab, DZB showed a positive interaction in the orthotopic syngeneic breast tumor model, 4T1, against both the primary tumor and metastases.

We tested the molecular effects of Cbz in treatment-na&#239;ve cells as well as after a chronic treatment with Sunitinib (Sun) and Pazopanib (Paz) <i>in vitro<\/i>. We used Sun-resistant (786-O\/S and Caki-2\/S), Paz-resistant cell lines (786-O\/P, Caki-2\/P), and the matched wild type (WT) cells (786-O\/WT and Caki-2\/WT). Treatment tolerance to Cbz (IC50 method) was tested by WST-1 and the drug&#8217; effect on signaling pathways was evaluated by immunoblotting. The pre-treatment with Sun increased the IC50 by 1.3 fold in the 786-O\/S cell lines (13&#181;M), compared to the 786-O\/WT cells (10&#181;M, p-value 0.002) but no difference was observed between Caki-2\/S and Caki-2\/WT cell lines (13&#181;M vs 14&#181;M, singly). In 786-O\/WT, Cbz caused a late down-regulation of the activated receptor P-MET (FC:-2.2), the coupled proteins Src and STAT3, and it impaired FAK. Unlike, P-MET was strongly decresed in Caki-2\/WT cells (FC:-10.4). We saw a compensatory activation of FAK and mTOR marker S6K during the treatment. Of note, Cbz elicited a MAPK by 1.5 FC in the 786-O\/WT and by 2.5 in Caki-2\/WT. The Sun-treatment enhanced P-MET<sup> <\/sup>only in 786-O\/S (FC: 2.6). Cbz caused late inhibition of P-MET in 786-O \/ S cells, but an early downregulation in Caki-2\/S cells. In both Sun-pretreated cells, Cbz impaired MAPK, mainly in 786-O\/S. Paz-pretreatment did not change either the cell viability of the 786-O\/P cells (IC50 of 10.4&#181;M vs 10.2&#181;M of 786-O\/WT), nor that of the Caki-2\/P cell lines (IC50 of 16 &#181;M vs 17 &#181;M of the age-matched Caki-2\/WT cells). In the Paz-resistant cells, P-MET was up-regulated by a FC of 6 and 2.4 in 786-O\/P and Caki-2\/P cells, respectively. A strong inhibition of P-MET by Cbz was observed independent on pretreatment. In both Sun-and Paz- resistant cell lines we observed a high activity of the protein complex Src-FAK, following Cbz treatment. While the protein level of MAPK was reduced by Cbz in the Sun- resistant cells, it was boosted in the 786-O \/ P and Caki-2\/P (FC: 2). Only the Sun-chronic treatment sensitized the resistant cells to the inhibition of S6K by Cbz. To conclude, the<b> <\/b>P-MET-driven state in Sun and Paz resistant cell lines, and in Caki -2 \/ WT cells did not sensitize the cells towards Cbz. The activation of Src-FAK protein axis, after P-MET inhibition, might suggest a synergy that could weaken Cbz&#8217;s antitumor activity in all resistant cells. Yet, a differential regulation of on mTOR or MAPK-signaling by Cbz might depend on Sun or Paz-pretreatment. Our data suggest that pretreatment with Sun could partially reduce the sensitivity towards Cbz. Still, it was cell line-dependent and thus, it might reflect the possible heterogeneity between patients. Overall, our study provides an understanding of cellular signaling of therapy sequencing using Cbz in mRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bda3f6c5-ed8b-48d1-94ac-5594c58b9092\/@r03B8ZRA\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18647"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Angela Zaccagnino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bozhena Vynnytska-Myronovska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Stöckle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerstin Junker<\/i><\/presenter>.

It also overcomes solvent front mutations (<i>e.g.,<\/i> TRKA G595R, TRKC G623R\/E) often developed following 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation TRK inhibitor treatment. Amongst other TRK mutations, ICP-723 exerts reduced activity in gatekeeper mutations (<i>e.g.,<\/i> TRKA F589L, TRKB F633L, TRKC F617L) and some xDFG mutations (<i>e.g.,<\/i> TRKA G667C\/S, TRKB G709C); but retains activity in other xDFG mutations (<i>e.g.,<\/i> TRKA G667A, TRKC G696A\/C) and unclassified mutations (<i>e.g.,<\/i> TRKA V573M, TRKA A608D, TRKB V689M). <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies further demonstrate its robust anti-tumor effects in xenograft models. Treatment with 1 mg\/kg of ICP-723 results in 89.5% TGI of KM12 tumors, similar to the efficacies of larotrectinib or selitrectinib at 30 mg\/kg dose levels. Treatment with 1 or 3 mg\/kg of ICP-723 leads to 100% survival of mice bearing Ba\/F3 <i>LMNA-NTRK1<\/i> G595R tumors, confirms the effectiveness of ICP-723 against solvent front mutant TRKA. The <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of ICP-723 is also well accompanied by pharmacodynamic modulation of TRK phosphorylation, where ICP-723 exposure levels correlate with the inhibition of TRK phosphorylation. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ICP-723 are overall favorable, with high oral bioavailability. Preclinical safety evaluations also exhibit acceptable drug tolerance in SD rats and Beagle dogs.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> ICP-723 is a novel, 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation pan-TRK inhibitor with broad-spectrum anti-tumor activities against wild-type and various acquired drug-resistant mutations of <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusions. ICP-723 is now in phase I clinical trial in China and United States.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f340186a-43bc-4c91-989e-0454dc844bee\/@r03B8ZRA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,pan-TRK inhibitor,preclinical characterization,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19023"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ruixia Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chao Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingrui Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prince Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Ying Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zuopeng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norman Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Bing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jasmine Jisong Cui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Davy Xuesong Ouyang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Even some patient with KRAS wt gene did not respond cetuximab. However, there is no treatment available for cetuximab-resistant patient group, which is almost 50% of KRAS WT gene holders. Recently, our team identified cetuximab primary resistant related proteins named as mtRTK (mutant receptor tyrosine kinase) by array analysis based cetuximab responder or non-responder colon cancer patient tissues. We investigated mtRTK&#8217;s oncogenic potential as a novel anti-cancer target. A large proportion of colon cancer patients (36.2% Caucasian, 56.9% Korean) expressed the mtRTK was identified, using the sequencing analysis of patient samples. Based on these results, our efforts have led to the discovery of WM-S1, mtRTK inhibitor, which is the first mtRTK inhibitor in clinical development. The potent enzyme inhibitor showed a high anticancer activity confirmed in Patient-Derived Cells (PDC) and Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) animal models expressing the mutation. In preclinical studies demonstrate that WM-S1 is well tolerated in rats and dogs. Furthermore, WM-S1 has potent anticancer activities for various solid tumor (NSCLC, cholangiocarcinoma, etc.) including activated mtKRAS colon cancer expressing the mtRTK. Currently we are investigating WM-S1 in a phase 1a trial in AUS, which is the first mtRTK inhibitor in clinical development. Meanwhile, the mtRTK inhibitor WM-S1 drives antitumor immunity (with anti-PD-L1) in NSCLC. Combinational approaches with immunotherapy showed that synergistic effect of WM-S1 and anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, suppressing tumor growth by 75% in anti-PD1 resistance NSCLC-derived humanized mouse model. A phase 1b trial is expected to develop WM-S1 through not only indication expansion but also combination therapy with immuno-checkpoint inhibitors in the USA, AUS and KOR from Q2 2022. In conclusion, mtRTK is a potential oncogenic driver mutation in various solid tumor. A first-in-class anticancer agent WM-S1 targeting mtRTK can be promising therapeutic agents for cetuximab-resistant colon cancer patients regardless of KRAS mutation status and other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd9d6f58-5578-4efa-bdee-01d9922bdf2e\/@r03B8ZRA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,KRAS,Mutations,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19188"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joseph Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jai-Hee Moon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyung-Mi Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Ryu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun Hye Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Hee Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong Seok Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Ok Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Seok Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyo Jin Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Young Kim Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moon Seong Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soll Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seongrak Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoon Sun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Ki Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mi So Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Hyun Go<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Geun Ji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Hyung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haneul Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hwa Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun Hee Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeo Jin Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung-Mi Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joon-yee Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeon-seoung Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung-geon Bae<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinwoo Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Won Jun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min-Kyeong Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji min Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-in Koh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun-Chul Hur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chun-Ho Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Hoon Jin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Standard treatment for CRC utilizes a combination therapy composed of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and folinic acid, known as FOLFOX. It has been established that patients with CRC tend to develop drug resistance to FOLFOX leading to a need for new chemotherapeutic treatments. Recent work has established that AS-10, a small molecule established for its promising role in treating pancreatic cancer, to be capable of inhibiting the growth of a range of CRC cell lines, including FOLFOX resistant CRC cells. Twenty-four cyclic and open chain analogs of AS-10 were synthesized and evaluated for their activity in inhibiting the viability of different cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. The cell viability of these compounds was compared to AS-10 in the cell lines of pancreatic carcinoma (MiaPaCa2), lung carcinoma (H460), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29), colorectal carcinoma (HCT116), and FOLFOX resistant HT29 and HCT116 cells. Based on the IC<sub>50<\/sub> values observed from these initial studies, only ASA-7, an open-chain alkyl selenocyanate, could treat all cancer cell lines in a similar concentration range of AS-10. Dose-response curves completed in 6 CRC cell lines indicated IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the range of 1-2 &#181;M for AS-10 and 3.3-6.6&#181;M for ASA-7. Cell viability evaluation in normal kidney (HEK293T) and colon (FHC) cell lines indicated AS-10 to be less toxic as compared to ASA-7. A similar trend was observed <i>in vivo<\/i> - AS-10 was 4 times more tolerable in mice as compared to ASA-7. A HCT116 xenograft study demonstrated the ability of AS-10 to significantly inhibit tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> without any apparent systemic toxicity. Moreover, AS-10 was assessed for its ability to act as an acetyl donor for histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and was found to initiate HAT activity in the absence of Acetyl-CoA in pancreatic epithelioid carcinoma (Panc-1) and colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cells. In conclusion, AS-10 was identified as the best among the 24 analogs, <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo,<\/i> when treating CRC and found to be capable of inducing HAT activity in both pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma elucidating a possible mechanism of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/61445e16-9976-45af-a7ef-05f8a0410c52\/@r03B8ZRA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor agents,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20596"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hannah Johnson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amandeep Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asif Raza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepkamal Karelia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Plano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shantu Amin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arun Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite efforts to develop new therapies, the standard of care for DLBCL remains chemotherapy based. The current standard of care is comprised of a regimen of 4 drugs (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) combined with immunotherapy using a chimeric mAb against the protein CD20 (rituximab), R-CHOP. Unfortunately only 50 to 60% of patients with DLBCL achieve and maintain complete remission after first-line therapy and 40 to 50 % relapse or have refractory disease. In addition, the average age at the time of diagnosis for DLBCL is 64 which makes intensive chemotherapy challenging. Therefore, the development of new treatment options is critical. We explored preclinical activity of AZD2811 nanoparticle, a potent and selective inhibitor of Aurora B kinase combined with venetoclax, an inhibitor of BCL2 currently used as standard of care in treatment of Haematological cancers, in B-Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma models. Twenty five B-cell NHL cell lines including 11 Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines were exposed to a 7 x 7 matrix of AZD2811 and venetoclax for 72 hrs. Cell viability was assessed using Celltiter-glo. Strong combination activity (HSA &#62; 0.1 and combination Emax &#62; 0.5) was observed in 6 cell lines including 2 DLBCL cell lines (WSU-DLCL2 and KARPAS_422). Moreover, pre-treatment with pan caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH, increased cell viability in cells treated with the combination. Next we explored the significant gene expression and mutation biomarkers (effect size &#62; 1, p &#60; 0.05) for this combination associated with Bliss and combination Emax in B-cell NHL cell lines. We found downregulation of 4 genes (FLT4, TIE1, PRKN) and mutations in 2 genes (EP300 and PTEN) to be associated with Bliss score and upregulation of one gene (FGR) associated with combination Emax. In vivo, antitumor activity of AZD2811 combined with venetoclax was assessed in mice bearing WSU-DLCL2luc xenografts. Once weekly intravenous administration of 25 mg\/kg AZD2811 resulted in a statistically significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 74%, while daily oral gavage of 100 mg\/kg venetoclax resulted in 49% TGI but failed to reach statistical significance. While both monotherapies were unable to prevent progressive tumor growth, a combination dosing regimen of AZD2811 and venetoclax drove progressive tumor regression resulting in statistically significant complete regression (98% regression) by the third week of dosing. These results suggest combining AZD2811 with venetoclax has potential to be active in DLBCL patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8dae2bc7-452a-430d-a8f1-7873909b3ce7\/@r03B8ZRA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Aurora kinase,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21183"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Azadeh Cheraghchi-Bashi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon Willis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin.

Notch pathophysiological activity involves activated Notch (i.e. NICD, the notch intracellular domain) forming a nuclear complex with DNA-binding factors and coactivators such as recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ). This evolutionary conserved mechanism is involved in the maintenance and survival of cancer stem cells, which can govern various cell activities like metastasis and chemoresistance. This study aims to examine the in vitro<\/i> effects of targeting the NICD-RBPJ interaction using a small molecular inhibitor of the RBPJ (RIN1) on osteosarcoma cell lines. We found that treatment of 10 &#181;M RIN1 on SJSA-1 (ATCC, CRL-2098), a human osteosarcoma cell line with a high Notch activity, can significantly decrease cell proliferation at 48 and 72 hours (h). We also found that at 10 &#181;M of RIN1 affects SJSA-1 migration using a Boyden chamber-based cell system at 24 h, a time point where we find minimal contribution from an effect on cell proliferation. Treatment with RIN1 can block SJSA-1 clonogenicity, but we showed that it has limited ability to block SJSA-1 cell invasion. Treatment with RIN1 does not initiate or enhance the osteoblast-like differentiation of SJSA-1. Notch target genes HEY1<\/i> and CyclinD1<\/i> was significantly modulated in SJSA-1 cells upon treatment in a Notch-independent manner. Interestingly, treatment with RIN1 on SJSA-1 decreases SOX2 protein expression, a well-known cancer stem cell marker, and upregulates tumor suppressor RB1 protein expression. Ongoing studies include additional <\/i>cellular function assays and RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of RIN1&#8217;s effect on two Notch-dependent cancer cell lines including MB 157 (ATCC, CRL-7721) and T29 in its activating context. In summary, RIN1 has been shown to have a significant effect on the different cell behaviors of human osteosarcoma, which may eventually facilitate with the treatment of patients that have metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7618f264-9cb8-4002-861b-d3e046242ff7\/@r03B8ZRA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Notch,Gene regulation,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21192"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Dakota Callahan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leetoria Hinojosa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haydee M.

VHL loss leads to HIF2&#945; accumulation and constitutive activation of its downstream genes important in carcinogenesis. Preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrate that HIF2&#945; inhibition by the first-in-class belzutifan (MK-6482) offers an effective treatment for ccRCC. Here we discovered a novel, potent, selective, and orally available small molecule HIF2&#945; inhibitor (NKT2152) through rational drug design. Cellular thermal shift assay demonstrated NKT2152 engaged HIF2&#945; and stabilized it against heat-induced denaturation in ccRCC 786-O cells. NKT2152 disrupted HIF2&#945;\/HIF1&#946; complex in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in increased cytosol localization and reduced nucleus localization of HIF2&#945; in 786-O cells. <i>In vitro<\/i>, NKT2152 specifically suppressed the expression of HIF2&#945; target genes including vascular endothelial growth factor A, cyclin D1, and glucose transporter 1 in 786-O cells. Pharmacodynamic analysis of NKT2152 in the 786-O xenograft tumor model confirmed that NKT2152 potently inhibited HIF2&#945; as demonstrated by the repression of HIF2&#945;-regulated genes at both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, NKT2152 treatment, administrated twice daily by oral gavage, led to a dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition or tumor regression in both ccRCC cell line-derived (A498 and 786-O) and patient-derived xenograft tumor models. More pronounced tumor growth inhibition was observed when NKT2152 was combined with a VEGFR inhibitor or a CDK4\/6 inhibitor in the 786-O xenograft tumor model. In addition to directly promoting tumor progression by regulating gene expression in tumor cells, HIF2&#945; has also been proposed to play an integral role in shaping the tumor microenvironment under hypoxia. Given hypoxia is a hallmark of most solid tumors and is associated with poor survival in a wide range of cancer types, we tested the hypothesis that HIF2&#945; inhibition by NKT2152 may exert broader anti-tumor activity in other solid tumors that lack a VHL gene deficiency. Indeed, we demonstrated here that NKT2152 caused significant tumor growth inhibition in multiple solid tumor xenograft models, including but not limited to hepatocellular carcinoma. NKT2152 had excellent oral bioavailability and achieved high exposures in mouse, rat and dog. These data not only support clinical development of NKT2152 in ccRCC, but also provide exciting opportunities for expanding to other solid tumor indications with tremendous unmet medical needs. Clinical evaluation of NKT2152 for the treatment of ccRCC is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1aeeb709-877e-4c85-b7bd-fc735e97e508\/@s03B8ZRB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia-inducible factor,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),Kidney cancer,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21357"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jing Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hairong Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenfeng Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianlin Geng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ke Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Zhihong Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiping Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yigang He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keshi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Lou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenhai Gao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Chordoma is a rare cancer derived from deregulation of the TF brachyury (encoded by the <i>T<\/i> gene). While brachyury is normally turned off in development and is minimally expressed in healthy tissues, it remains highly expressed and is required in chordoma. TFs like brachyury have been challenging to drug directly, and chordoma represents an ideal system for studying both the biology behind a transcriptional dependency in cancer and how it can therapeutically targeted. Given that chordomas lack targeted therapies, we aim to understand the role of brachyury in the disease, identify therapeutic strategies to target its genetic regulation, and ultimately translate these findings towards the clinic. To achieve this, we sought to compare the consequences of direct and indirect brachyury targeting via targeted protein degradation and transcriptional CDK inhibition. In the absence of a brachyury small molecule, we generated human chordoma cell lines that express only a degradable form of brachyury. With these cell lines, we have mapped the brachyury regulome and have used high resolution microscopy to visualise brachyury genetic regulation. We find that brachyury is an ultra-selective regulator in chordoma, and that brachyury autoregulates through a transcriptional condensate. Both targeted brachyury degradation and transcriptional inhibition with THZ1, a preclinical tool compound inhibiting CDKs 7\/12\/13, can selectively inhibit <i>T<\/i> transcription and disrupt the brachyury transcriptional condensate. While these direct and indirect approaches converge to target brachyury, they have distinct phenotypic outcomes; brachyury degradation induces senescence and transcriptional inhibition causes apoptosis. Specifically, brachyury degradation primes cells to treatment with senolytics, which selectively kill senescent chordoma cells. Targeting senescence represents a novel therapeutic strategy in chordoma. Our findings affirm that brachyury is the most promising target in chordoma. We show that while transcriptional inhibition can selectively target brachyury, it mechanistically it contrasts with direct brachyury inhibition. However, these dual therapeutic strategies show that is indeed possible to progress in targeting oncoproteins that have long been considered &#8220;undruggable&#8221;, and our efforts not only benefit chordoma patients but provide a framework for drugging other transcriptionally addicted cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a0a9bb14-5b9d-4c49-80b2-2f37cdc2beec\/@s03B8ZRB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Senescence,Transcriptional regulation,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21471"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hadley E.

Central roles for JAK2 signaling in myelofibrosis (MF) have been established, leading to marked extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, and bone marrow fibrosis, but the use of JAK inhibitors has shown limited ability to produce durable remissions in most patient populations. Bypass or resistance mechanisms to JAK inhibition have been linked to concomitant activation of compensatory phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, and while genetic and functional studies have not fully defined the mechanisms for transformation and maintenance of the proliferative state in MF, targeting multiple signaling pathways will be required to alter the disease course and improve therapeutic outcomes. Treatments using kinase inhibitor combinations remain a challenge clinically, and trials have struggled to create positive balance between gains in survival, therapeutic efficacy, and dose-limiting toxicity. A multi-functional kinase inhibitor was developed to deliver consistent and synergistic dosing ratios against multiple targets simultaneously, thereby blocking compensatory oncogenic signaling pathways while minimizing the prospect for adverse effects. Using synthetic medicinal chemistry, we present a potent and selective, orally bioavailable, single-molecule multi-targeted kinase inhibitor (LP-182) against MAPK and PI3K\/mTOR signaling pathways. We demonstrate selectivity and therapeutic efficacy through <i>in vitro<\/i> screening of kinome inhibition, reduction of cell growth and downstream kinase activation, renormalization of immune cell populations, amelioration of splenomegaly and bone marrow fibrosis, and improved survival in the myeloproliferative leukemia oncogene (<i>MPL<sup>W515L<\/sup><\/i>) mouse model of myelofibrosis. Furthermore, treatment with LP-182 was well tolerated showing no observable pharmacotoxicity, and combination with the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib also showed ~35% reduction in spleen size as compared to either treatment alone with a ~60% spleen volume reduction compared to vehicle treatment, in the JAK2<sup>+\/V617F<\/sup> mutant mouse model. Overall, these data suggest that <i>in vivo<\/i> bioavailability and distribution of LP-182 to secondary lymphoid tissues attenuates MAPK and PI3K signaling to alleviate disease phenotypes in animal models of MF. Simultaneous targeting of both MAPK and PI3K pathways with LP-182 alone or in combination with JAK inhibition provides the potential for significant new opportunities to improve the clinical outcome of MF patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a114a935-e94d-4392-b397-087ef4308c27\/@s03B8ZRB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Combination therapy,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21473"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher A.

The oncogene <i>KRAS<\/i> is frequently amplified in CIN type gastric cancer (14.3%) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (10.4%). SHP2 is a phosphatase which is a part of a machinery activating KRAS from GDP-bound inactive status to GTP-bound active status, and our group previously reported that <i>KRAS<\/i>-amplified gastric tumors are relatively resistant to MEK inhibition but sensitive to MEK \/ SHP2 co-inhibition. While the combination of MEK and SHP2 inhibitors showed efficacy in pre-clinical models, the translation of this combination has been challenging, in part due to on-target toxicity from inhibitors of the MAPK pathway (Auliac, et al. <i>Cancers<\/i>. 2020). Therefore, we sought better combination strategy with SHP2 inhibition, using genome-wide CRISPR screen. We conducted primary CRISPR screening with two GEA cell lines (KE-39 and HUG1-N) and CRISPR-KO lentivirus library (Brunello CRISPR knockout pooled library, 77,741 sgRNAs \/ 19,114 genes, Broad Institute Genomic Perturbation Platform) and identified candidate targets both within the MAPK pathway and among upstream tyrosine kinases that may enhance the efficacy of a SHP2 inhibitor in <i>KRAS<\/i>-amplified GEA. Prior to detailed analyses of potential hits from the screen, we performed the secondary screen with additional KRAS-amplified and -mutant cell lines (CAT12, YCC-1, and GSU) using a custom CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA library targeting 509 genes of interest including top hits in each cell line data set, and confirmed that knockout of <i>KRAS<\/i> upstream and downstream genes have additive cytotoxicity to SHP2 inhibition. Given our focus on finding targets that could be readily translated into therapeutics, we focused our analysis on those of most ready translational relevance and specifically chose ERBBs, FAK, SRC, RAFs, ERK1\/2, and CDK4\/6 as candidate targets. Further analyses showed the potent cytotoxicity of SHP2 inhibition with a pan-ERBB kinase inhibitior (Afatinib) and with a CDK4\/6 inhibitor (Ribociclib), with greater efficacy of this combination in <i>KRAS<\/i>-amplified tumors compared to <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant tumors, both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments.

Such undesired paradoxical activation not only leads to renewed tumor growth but also spurs additional cancer growth in non-cancerous wild-type BRAF tissue. Plus, these first-generation RAF inhibitors targeting BRAF<sup>V600<\/sup> mutants are unable to inhibit oncogenic RAF dimers. This has led to the development of type II RAF inhibitors such as belvarafenib and day101 to block the activity of multiple forms of RAF while avoiding paradoxical activation. Two lead-like stage compounds 1 and 2 were specifically designed as type II RAF inhibitors to have activity across RAF isoforms including BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>, BRAF wild-type, and CRAF, showing higher potency than competitors. Compounds 1 and 2 potently inhibited the growth of BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> melanoma cells and NRAS or KRAS mutant cancer cells. Compounds 1 and 2 promoted the formation of BRAF\/CRAF heterodimers by directly binding to the RAF kinase domain like other type II RAF inhibitors and inhibited phosphorylation of downstream effectors MEK and ERK in a dose-dependent manner in RAS mutant cancer cells, suggesting less paradoxical activation liability. Compound 2 showed superior on-target inhibitory activity for BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>, BRAF wild-type, and CRAF than belvarafenib through RAF immunoprecipitation (IP) kinase assay. Inhibition of the RAF downstream signaling was also confirmed by quantifying the level of phospho-ERK in NRAS or KRAS mutant cancer cells. In HCT116 (KRAS<sup>G13D<\/sup>) subcutaneous xenograft model, compound 1 showed tumor growth inhibition efficacy, suggesting a potential to address RAS mutant driven- as well as BRAF<sup>V600<\/sup> mutant driven tumors. Also, combination treatment with MEK inhibitor and\/or immune checkpoint inhibitor would further improve the therapeutic activity and expand target indication for unmet medical needs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3419eefe-272a-4690-8b08-c9adb0fc77dd\/@s03B8ZRB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RAF kinase,Small molecule kinase inhibitor,RAF or RAS mutant solid tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20032"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kwangwoo Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>SeoHyun Jo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jieun Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ga-young Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiseon Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Hye Kwon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Guk Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiyeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Se-Hyuk Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haelee Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ha Yeon Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung Beom Son<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nam Doo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hwan Geun Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daekwon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sunghwan Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

SMDC products that have been developed for clinical applications are targeting internalizing tumor-associated antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells. We have recently developed a novel non-internalizing small organic ligand (named OncoFAP) of Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP), a tumor-associated antigen highly expressed in the stroma of most of solid human malignancies. The tumor targeting performance of OncoFAP has been validated by nuclear medicine studies in patients with various solid tumors. In a previous study, we showed that OncoFAP can be used to produce non-internalizing SMDCs that are effective and well tolerated. Here, we describe a new series of OncoFAP-Drug derivatives based on the MMAE tubulin poison and dipeptide linkers that are selectively cleaved by FAP in the tumor microenvironment. We benchmarked the new SMDCs against OncoFAP-MMAE conjugates displaying linker modules which are widely used in approved and clinical stage Antibody-Drug Conjugates, including structures cleaved by Cathepsin B and by reducing agents. We selected OncoFAP-GlyPro-MMAE as the most efficacious and safe SMDC for further clinical development after quantitatively analyzing the biodistribution of MMAE released by OncoFAP-MMAE conjugates. OncoFAP-GlyPro-MMAE selectively delivers high amounts of MMAE at the site of disease, with a tumor-to-kidney ratio of 7-to-1 and of 16-to-1 at 6- and 24-hours post-injection, respectively. Our molecules based on the OncoFAP tumor-targeting ligand and FAP-cleavable linkers promise to be safe and effective against most of human malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9f4d22de-dcc0-4cd3-bd78-3d2c0cbcf67c\/@s03B8ZRB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule drugs,Cytotoxicity,Fibroblasts,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20033"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aureliano Zana<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Galbiati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ettore Gilardoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacopo Millul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theo Sturm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riccardo Stucchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matilde Bocci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdullah Elsayed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Nadal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Cirillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dario Neri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuele Cazzamalli<\/i><\/presenter>.

We report here the biomarker analysis to assess correlation with response of baseline samples for PTEN expression and GEP signatures.<br \/>Methods: Adult patients with relapsed B-cell iNHL were randomly assigned 2:1 to either C + R or P + R; standard dosing on a 28-day cycle applied. Either fresh or archival tumor tissues were collected for central pathology review and biomarker analysis. Extraction of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue slides was performed using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA\/RNA FFPE Kit, where quality was assessed using a combination of Agilent TapeStation for integrity and ThermoFisher NanoDrop for quantity and purity. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PTEN expression was performed by Mosaic Laboratories (Lake Forest, CA, USA) and RNA sequencing analysis was performed by Almac Diagnostics (Durham, NC, USA). GEP was also conducted using clara<sup>T<\/sup> pathway signatures provided by Almac.<br \/>Results: Patients with complete, very good partial, and partial objective responses were combined in a &#8220;responders&#8221; group and compared against all other patients (&#8220;non-responders&#8221; group). Data from PTEN IHC were available for 222 patients (149 for C + R; 73 for P + R). There was no statistically significant difference in response with PTEN presence or absence for the 3 subgroups - total iNHL, follicular lymphoma (FL), and non-FL. Also, baseline PTEN expression did not show significant correlation with best overall response. C + R treatment improved median progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients, with a statistically significant benefit to those with PTEN presence in all 3 subgroups. For patients treated with P + R, Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests showed statistically improved median PFS in patients with PTEN absence vs PTEN presence in overall iNHL (p=0.031) and FL (p=0.0021). Data from GEP were available for 202 patients (133 for C + R; 69 for P + R). The association with best overall response and PFS was analyzed using specific biomarker gene sets and\/or 23 preselected clinical parameters. Association of GEP analysis based on hypothesis-based modeling, single-gene hypothesis-free modeling, and clara<sup>T<\/sup> pathway signatures showed no predicted responsiveness or PFS that was statistically significant.<br \/>Conclusions: C + R improved median PFS in the overall iNHL, FL, and non-FL groups, with a statistically significant improvement in the PTEN-positive population. In the P + R group, PTEN-positive patients had worse PFS in all 3 subgroups.

RON has been known to be highly expressed in several epithelial tumors, promoting tumor progression and metastasis, and on macrophages surface, facilitating M2-like phenotype polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) to impair anti-tumor functions of CD8+ T cells. Although pharmacological inhibition of RON kinase has received attention from many research groups, monoclonal antibody drug showed a limited clinical efficacy due to RON variant of receptor region. Because the structure homology of kinase domain between RON and MET is 80%, discovery of RON-specific small molecule inhibitor is considered to be highly challenging to achieve. At first, we discovered a lead compound with about 50-fold of RON selectivity against MET kinase. Our medicinal chemistry efforts elevated RON\/MET selectivity up to 500~10,000-fold (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 1~50 nM in RON enzyme assay), and the target specificity was proved through a panel assay of 372 kinases (Reaction Biology Corp.). A series of compounds effectively modulated p-RON and downstream signals (e.g. p-ERK and p-AKT) in MDA-MB-453, and inhibited cell proliferation of Ba\/F3 cell-line engineered with human RON kinase. Significant anti-tumor effects were shown in syngeneic mouse models compared to a control group after oral administration, and studies related to immuno-oncology are ongoing in in-vitro or ex-\/in-vivo assay systems. In conclusion, we have identified RON selective small molecule inhibitors that will be useful to figure out the biology following RON selective inhibition against MET kinase, and to validate the translational potential of RON kinase as a therapeutic target for human diseases including cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c513b4fe-e081-44b0-be14-b55f62f6a261\/@s03B8ZRB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),Kinase inhibitors,Macrophages,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20035"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Young Jin Ham<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>GyeongHwan Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juhyun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaeyoung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Kyung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunhong Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woosook Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han Byoul Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung Woong Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hee Dong Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seonguk Jeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seok-Joo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joongheui Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jungjoon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong bin Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngshin Kwak<\/i><\/presenter>.

Currently approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown efficacy in NSCLC patients with exon20 insertion and atypical mutations, but with limited overall response and high rate of EGFR-related severe adverse events. This may be associated with the inhibition of wild-type (WT) EGFR. ABSK111 is a highly potent, selective, and CNS-penetrable EGFR inhibitor, targeting multiple EGFR and HER2 mutations, including exon20 insertion, atypical, and extracellular mutations. Here we describe the preclinical<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> characterization of ABSK111. ABSK111 potently inhibited the proliferation of BA\/F3 cell lines harboring EGFR exon20, atypical and extracellular mutations with higher selectivity for WT EGFR than currently approved EGFR TKIs. ABSK111 also suppressed HER2 atypical and exon20 mutations. Further, ABSK111 potently blocked the phosphorylation of EGFR exon20 insertion mutations and EGFR variant III in BA\/F3 cell lines, with less inhibition of WT EGFR signal than the approved TKIs. Moreover, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated sustained and exposure-dependent suppression of p-ERK in tumor tissue following a single oral dose of ABSK111. Finally, ABSK111 showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in BA\/F3 tumor models with EGFR exon20 insertion mutations and EGFR variant III without significant body weight loss. Pharmacodynamic analysis of endpoint samples from efficacy study showed sustained inhibition of p-ERK, which was superior to the approved exon20 insertion inhibitor mobocertinib. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of ABSK111 to inhibit a broad spectrum of EGFR and HER2 mutations, including exon20 insertions, atypical and extracellular mutations, while sparing the WT form of EGFR. In addition to the application in NSCLC, the activity against EGFR extracellular mutations and the ability to penetrate into brain suggest the application of ABSK111 in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/108bcb7c-0139-41ec-80c5-147a76c035bb\/@s03B8ZRB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,NSCLC,Glioblastoma multiforme,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20036"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Cheng Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haibing Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongping Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yaochang Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Shuqun Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

MLL1 dysregulation such as its translocation at chromosome 11q23 results in generation of MLL1 fusion genes and leukemia development. Additionally, recent studies indicated a role for MLL1-WDR5 interaction in solid tumors progression via directly affecting cancer cells or by suppression of tumor immunity. Therefore, MLL1-WDR5 interaction is an important target in cancer drug discovery, both in leukemia and in solid tumors. HUYABIO recently completed acquisition of a novel series of MLL1-WDR5 inhibitors and conducted an additional SAR campaign to identify a lead compound with greater efficacy and PK (pharmacokinetics)characteristics. Characterization of a series of analogs identified HBI-2375 as a selective inhibitor of MLL1-WDR5 interaction. TR-FRET peptide binding assay indicated potent binding of HBI-2375 to WDR5 (IC50=4.48 nM) and<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vitro<\/i> cell potency studies showed inhibition of proliferation in MV4;11 leukemia cells by HBI-2375 (IC50=3.17 &#181;M).Furthermore, HBI-2375 was stable in liver S9 and whole blood and displayed reasonable PK properties (Cmax, T1\/2, AUC and F%) in preclinical testing in mouse and dog.<i> <\/i><i>In<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vivo efficacy<\/i> studies in MV4;11 model showed 86% and 77% tumor growth inhibition in HBI-2375 treated tumors when dosed at 80 mpk or 40 mpk (po, qd x 21) respectively.

Approximately 80% of patients with GIST present with mutations in the c-<i>KIT<\/i> oncogene at exon 9 or 11, which leads to constitutive, ligand-independent activation of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase. For patients with metastatic GIST, frontline therapy with imatinib is effective, with a response rate of approximately 51-54% and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 19-23 months, in a molecularly unselected population. Other agents are approved for advanced GIST, without molecular selection, after progression on imatinib, including sunitinib, regorafenib, and ripretinib; however, response rates are less than 10% with PFS of approximately 5-6 months. Notably, patients who progress on imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors may develop a variety of on-target resistance mutations in the <i>KIT<\/i> oncogene, such as those in exon 17 (including at amino acids D816 and D820, activation loop mutation), exon 13 (V654A, ATP-binding region mutation), and less frequently in exon 14 (T670I, gatekeeper mutation). Several KIT inhibitors have been developed to potently target the exon 17 resistance mutations (avapritinib and ripretinib); however, there remains an important medical need in 2<sup>nd<\/sup>- and 3<sup>rd<\/sup>-line therapy in a molecularly unselected population of imatinib-resistant GIST. This suggests more broad-spectrum KIT inhibition is likely required, a hypothesis supported by the observation of large inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity of <i>KIT<\/i> secondary mutations across hundreds of samples obtained from patients with GIST treated with avapritinib. Sequencing data from the NAVIGATOR phase 1 trial (NCT02508532) revealed that patients with <i>KIT <\/i>mutant GIST and with the <i>KIT<\/i> V654A secondary resistance mutation had a poor response to treatment with avapritinib. To address this, we developed a highly potent and selective inhibitor of KIT<i> <\/i>V654A. This inhibitor showed dose-dependent modulation of downstream pharmacodynamic markers and induced tumor regression in a mastocytoma xenograft model driven by an exon 11 plus 13 V654A resistance mutation. Importantly, this inhibitor was generally well-tolerated and showed high selectivity over wild-type KIT. These findings suggest this novel KIT inhibitor has the potential to be used as a single agent or combination therapy for patients with imatinib-resistant GIST harboring the <i>KIT<\/i> V654A mutation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ca0b0840-916e-406c-85b6-695603e36cf5\/@t03B8ZRC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kit tyrosine kinase,Kinase inhibitors,GIST,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21344"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c45bdb72-8011-4d1b-be72-421f0a1e2e02","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c45bdb72-8011-4d1b-be72-421f0a1e2e02\/@t03B8ZRC\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexandra R.

PLK1 is overexpressed in many tumor types. PLK1 inhibition selectively kills cancer cells because they are dependent on the mitotic functions of PLK1. PLK1 consists of a highly conserved N-terminal catalytic kinase domain and a unique, functionally essential C-terminal Polo Box Domain (PBD). The PBD is a phospho-peptide binding motif that determines substrate recognition and sub-cellular localization. PLK1 catalytic inhibitors have advanced to clinical trials but not demonstrated convincing efficacy. Targeting the PBD offers an attractive alternative to pursue PLK1 inhibition. An iterative strategy called REPLACE, involving computational and synthetic approaches, was utilized to generate fragment-ligated inhibitory peptides and further application of REPLACE resulted in non-peptidic compounds named abbapolins. In recently published studies, abbapolins were found to specifically bind to the PBD of PLK1 in biochemical and cellular assays. The phosphorylation of TCTP, a specific PLK1 substrate, was measured in abbapolin treated cancer cells. Abbapolins produced a dose dependent reduction in p-TCTP. We also made a novel observation that abbapolins upon binding to PLK1 induced its intracellular loss in a mechanism at least partially dependent on the proteasome. Spurred on by this unique mechanism of action, we initiated studies on the interactions of catalytic inhibitors and PBD-binding abbapolins with PLK1 <i>in vitro<\/i> and in cellular contexts. Biochemical assays were performed with full length PLK1 <i>in vitro <\/i>and intracellular PLK1 binding was measured by a Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA). We report novel findings during mitosis inferred from our collective data, namely that catalytic binding by BI2536 or volasertib unexpectedly decreased soluble PLK1 as determined by CETSA, inferring induction of a conformational change in intracellular PLK1. In contrast, abbapolins produced the expected right shift in the melting curve of PLK1. Intriguingly, these differential effects on PLK1 thermal stability have opposing impacts on the fate of intracellular PLK1. Binding by catalytic inhibitors cause accumulation of PLK1, whereas PBD binding by abbapolins ultimately lead to its loss. Results from quantifying intracellular PLK1 were also supported <i>in vitro<\/i> by evidence of cooperative binding between catalytic inhibitors and abbapolins in the context of the FL protein and suggest that conformational changes induced by binding to the catalytic site increase affinity of abbapolins for the PDB. Collectively, the results shed further insight into the unique mechanism of action for abbapolins potentially due to their engagement of a cryptic hydrophobic pocket of the PBD. Abbapolins are thus a compelling alternative to catalytic-based inhibitors for the development of novel therapeutics targeting PLK1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fa8e7729-da37-4476-97ce-7a4384c118b8\/@t03B8ZRC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein-protein interactions,Small molecule inhibitor,Proteasome mediated protein degradation,Novel mechanism of action ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21760"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Danda Chapagai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Merissa Baxter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Craig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guru Ramamoorthy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessy Stafford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sikirzhytski Vitali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elmar Nurmemmedov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Campbell McInnes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael D.
