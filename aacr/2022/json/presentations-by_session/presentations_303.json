[{"Abstract":"The Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene is in chromosome 9q21 location, which includes p16\/CDKNA and is homozygously deleted in about 15% of all cancers, including a large proportion of gliomas, mesotheliomas and T cell lymphomas. MTAP cleaves methylthioadenosine (MTA), a byproduct of polyamine synthesis, to regenerate methionine and adenine. Several functional genomics screens have identified the downstream genes MAT2A and PRMT5 as synthetically lethal with MTAP loss. These two targets have been the subject of several drug discovery efforts. Our approach was based on a forward chemical genetic approach, in which we employed two isogenic cell lines, PANC1, with MTAP loss and PAM cells where MTAP is re-introduced. A library of over 200,000 compounds was screened for hits that affected the viability of PANC1 cell, whereas spared PAM cells. One hit series was found to reproducibly inhibit the proliferation of PANC1 cells with EC50s in the low single digit uM range and one order of selectivity over PAM cells. Phenotype-based optimization resulted in improved analogs, with prototype MTB-22252 exhibiting an EC50 of 47nM in PANC1 cells and 15-fold selectivity. An affinity probe was designed based on an analog of MTB-22252 bearing a biotin moiety via a linker and an azide group for photoactivatable cross-linking with potential interacting proteins. This probe maintained cellular activity and selectivity and it was used in an MS-proteomics experiment in PANC1 cells. The top protein identified by this experiment showed high enrichment over DMSO control and was effectively competed out by MTB-22252. MTB2252 and analogs thermo-stabilized this protein by up to 5<sup>0<\/sup>C in PANC1 cells. PANC1 cells expressed high levels of this protein, whereas insensitive PAM cell did not express it at all. In additional cell line pairs, sensitivity to MTB-2252 correlated well with the expression levels of this protein. Reintroduction of MTAP in cells lacking MTAP and this new protein, resulted in loss of expression of the new protein, suggesting a regulatory connection. In a wider cell panel of over 130 cell lines, there was correlation of sensitivity with MTAP loss and even better correlation with the expression levels of this protein. Some of the most sensitive cell lines included several colorectal, glioma and hematologic cancer cell lines. In vivo evaluation of MTB-9655 against some of the most sensitive tumor cell lines is on-going.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f1335975-effe-4b54-9f2f-5347b79764a6\/@A03B8ZAR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Phenotype,Methylation,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13811"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andreas Goutopoulos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Amanati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avital Hay-Koren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Fattaey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Nakache<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dimitri Kovalerchik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dikla Paz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Botti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanna Oppenheimer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omri Erez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irit Fainer<\/i><\/presenter>.

We developed our expertise to further optimize those cyclic molecules. Having low molecular weight, they favorably alter the biological and physiochemical properties as well as selectivity, as compared to their linear parent, yielding high-quality drug candidates. While focused on kinase inhibitors, macrocyclic derivatives could be potentially turned into bifunctional protein degrader molecules useful for selective cellular knockdown of targeted proteins and investigation of the pharmacological effects. With macrocyclic &#8220;probes&#8221; from our proprietary library in nanomolar range IC50, we turned our attention to CDK9 inhibitors with good selectivity profile against CDK1\/2\/5\/7. Previous CDK9 degraders based on acyclic inhibitors have used thalidomide as recruiter of the CRL4CRBN, resulting in successful ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the protein of interest. Applying a three-step approach, we first defined the vector of substitution on our macrocyclic &#8220;probes&#8221; by homology modeling with known acyclic ligands\/CDK9 co-crystal structures. Having defined 2 substitution patterns, we synthesized and tested in a biochemical assay the novels &#8220;probes&#8221; vectorized with the pro-linker moieties, without loss of activity. ODS&#8217;7152 was further derived into fully bifunctional molecules with variation on the linker&#8217;s nature and length, keeping thalidomide as the E3 ligase recruiter. Biophysical and biological properties were further evaluated in an MTS assay against several cell lines (HCT116, Jurkat E6.2, MOLT-4 and MV4-11) to assess cell proliferation and viability. The E3 Ligase engagement along with cell penetration was measured in a NanoBRET&#8482; assay and compared to MDR_MDCK permeability. Finally, a selection of 4 PROTACs were evaluated in a dose response assay on MV4-11 for protein degradation phosphorylation of CTD-pol II and selectivity among several CDKs. Our findings support the rapid derivatization of macrocyclic &#8220;probes&#8221; inhibitors into macrocyclic-PROTAC as a strategy to generate early chemical biology tools with maintained potency and selectivity between homologous targets. Optimization of the physico-chemical and ADME properties of molecules can lead to drug candidates with distinct pharmacological effects as compared to the parent linear kinase inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/14a75fcd-0ef0-4dfc-b67b-83dc9db62fd4\/@A03B8ZAR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Kinase inhibitors,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Drug design,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13812"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Nerina Dodic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Ancellin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morgane Bordessoules<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Bouillot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Butin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cedric Charrier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie-Helene Fouchet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Laroze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Pascale Luzy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandre Moquette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Pilot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guillaume Serin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jean-François Mirjolet<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabrice Viviani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Parsy<\/i><\/presenter>.

The emergence of clinical resistance to the first-generation covalent BTK inhibitors is, however, becoming a serious concern. Patients are reported to develop resistance during the treatment due to substitution of cysteine residue at position 481 with serine (C481S mutation) in BTK, which prevents the covalent binding of the first-generation irreversible BTK inhibitors, resulting in the loss of inhibitory activities. Therefore, there is a high unmet medical need for new therapeutic approaches to overcome the BTK C481S-mediated resistance.<br \/><b>Material and methods:<\/b> Compounds were tested in biochemical assays using recombinant human wildtype (WT) and C481S mutant BTKs. Cellular activity of AS-1763 was evaluated in human diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, OCI-Ly10 and its BTK[C481S] knock-in cells. The in vivo antitumor activity of AS-1763 was assessed in two tumor xenograft mouse models bearing WT or BTK [C481S] knock-in OCI-Ly10 cells.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We have discovered AS-1763 as an orally available, highly potent, selective and reversible BTK inhibitor.

Beyond the leading radiopharmaceutical molecules <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-DOTATATE or <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PSMA-617, a variety of vectors (small molecules, peptides, panel of biologics) have been developed on the same targets in order to improve the biodistribution within the tumor, the blood clearance, the route of elimination or the dosimetry. The labeling of the targeting ligand, whatever its nature, is a crucial step as it may affect significantly the properties of the theranostic conjugate, i.e. its binding affinity, PK and biodistribution. The addition of linkers, such as albumin binding domain or PEG, and choice of chelating agents have a major impact on the chemical and biological properties of the vectors. Random or site-specific bioconjugation, click chemistry, also have to be considered in the early stage as the choice of the selected technology will modify your development plan and manufacturing. New ligands and biological platforms are now being developed based on this historical knowledge, improved Target Product Profiles are built to conduct optimal lead optimization of MRT. Herein, we will present our lead optimization and preclinical evaluation process to select efficiently good radiolabeled molecules and list the key parameters to be checked. To date, it remains hard to predict the behavior of the modified bioconjugated molecules, and versatile synthesis strategies are needed to screen various combinations of radiometal complexes, linker and conjugation function, in order to converge rapidly to the optimized bioconjugate. As an example, we will present a study case where the conjugation of various bifunctional chelating agents on a small NTS1 receptor antagonist resulted in drastically different in vivo behavior of the resulting <sup>68<\/sup>Ga-labeled compounds. Once optimal in vivo tumor uptake has been achieved, preclinical evaluation requires the selection of appropriate and relevant models, driven by target expression, radioresistance, and potentially tumor immune infiltrate for combination studies with immunotherapies. The therapeutic evaluation should take into consideration the dose and specific activity, the tolerance of a model related to ionizing radiations and the scheduling of treatments (cumulated dose, fractionation). We will present our recent results which highlight the importance to optimize these parameters to improve the efficacy of MRT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58c0c632-99fd-4901-b0a1-73d847814a1f\/@s03B8ZAS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Lead optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Theranostics,In vivo imaging,Targeted therapy,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13816"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Emma Renard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Raguin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Goncalves<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Celine Mothes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathieu Moreau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claire Bernhard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peggy Provent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederic Boschetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Franck Denat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabrice Viviani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Cyril Berthet<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The cGAS-STING axis also plays an essential role in initiating host immune defense against microbial invasion and STING-deficient mice are more susceptible to some viral infections. Credible evidence suggests that the cGAS-cGAMP-STI NG pathway makes fundamental contributions to at least three major cancer therapies, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and thus represents a promising pharmaceutical target. cGAS is well-positioned to act as a DNA sensor that triggers innate immune responses through production of the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) upon binding to DNA and initiating host immune responses against pathogens and cancer. However, inappropriate activation of STING signaling causes severe and often fatal autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases. Hence, STING is an attractive drug target for the treatment of STING-driven autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Therefore, there is a need to identify lead compounds that effectively inhibit human STING for further drug development. An attempt to search for such molecules have been described recently with the report on a STING-specific inhibitor that showed high efficiency, specificity, and safety, paving the way for therapeutically manipulating STING-mediated clinical diseases. Towards this goal, we have developed a bioluminescent assay to monitor the concentration of cGAMP in intracellular as well as extracellular compartments. The assay relies on the use of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) to release AMP which can be converted to ATP via a coupled enzyme reaction. The ATP generated can be quantified using luciferase\/luciferin detection reagents. The assay is homogenous, HTS formatted and can be completed in less than one hour. The assay is sensitive and can detect as low as 10 nM cGAMP. We will show data on the use of agents that stimulate GAS activity such as dsDNA, and the use of reporter assays to detect cytokine release upon cGAS-STING activation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,High-throughput assay,Assay development,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13817"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Said A.

Cancer cell plasticity, with genetic and epigenetic alterations, promote the diversity of cancer cells contributing to heterogeneity within the tumor. Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a notable example of this diversity; HNC tumors harbor cells with a wide genetic and metabolic heterogeneity, including cancer stem cells (CSC). Despite current treatment approaches, more than 40% of HNC patients have disease recurrence. Thus, we developed a multimodal approach to effectively prevent the development of radio\/drug-resistance.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures:<\/b> Nuclear-localized mkate2 expressing HNC cell numbers detected for every 6 hours by using IncuCyte S3 instrument. Apoptotic cells detected via NucView 488 Caspase-3 substrate and ROS levels determined using CellROX green simultaneously with cell numbers in the IncuCyte S3 instrument. Synergy scores calculated according to viability in SynergyFinder 2.0 web-application.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our preliminary data profiling of metabolic regulators as radiosensitizer indicate that auranofin (AUR, thioredoxin reductase inhibitor) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, &#947;-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor), given in combination with radiation (RT+AUR+BSO): 1) significantly inhibit proliferation in HNC cell lines, 2) increase ROS accumulation, and 3) reduce the surviving fraction of cells in colony forming assays compared to individual\/dual agent applications. Furthermore, we added an autophagy inhibitor, SAR405, in our treatment regimen because of the crosstalk between ROS levels and autophagy. Human (FaDu and UM-SCC-47) and murine (MOC1 and MOC2) HNC cell were treated with +\/-AUR+\/-BSO+\/-SAR405 and high-throughput combinatorial screening of cell numbers obtained over time. The combination of AUR+BSO+SAR405 registered a higher synergy score than the double combinations. Furthermore, as compared to single or double drug applications, the AUR+BSO+SAR405 group had a greater apoptotic cell rate and ROS levels.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We present here a high-throughput method to screen multi-drug synergy. Multi-modal approach is important to prevent recurrence by providing a broader effect on heterogenous cancer cells in tumor. Moreover, multi-drug combinations allow usage of lower doses of drugs effectively, hence lowers the treatment-related adverse effects. This approach indicated the possibility of HNC treatment by increasing the ROS levels beyond the containable threshold which is consistent with the recent findings about the alterations in redox metabolism, particularly upregulation in thioredoxin and glutathione pathways, in many cancer types. In vivo experiments are ongoing to evaluate the potential of this combination for clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/04287358-1391-472e-8f5e-98fa9d8e527d\/@s03B8ZAS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Reactive oxygen species,Head and neck cancers,Cancer metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13818"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zafer Gurel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qianyun Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael S.

STAT3 may serve as a good target for the treatment of prostate cancer. The function of STAT3 relies significantly on its SH2 domain, which promotes STAT3 homo- or hetero-dimerization, protein-protein interaction and nuclear translocation of the STAT3 dimers needed for transcription. Due to this important role, the STAT3 SH2 domain becomes an attractive therapeutic target. In a drug discovery and development program we have found two small molecular compounds named 323-1 and 323-2 that were identified as novel STAT3 SH2 domain inhibitors in a series of experiments.<br \/><b>Material and methods <\/b><i>In silico<\/i> computational modeling, Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS) and Fluorescence Polarization (FP) assays were performed to examine whether compounds 323-1 and 323-2 could bind to the STAT3 protein. The antitumor activity of compounds 323-1 and 323-2 was firstly determined by clonogenic assays in different prostate tumor cells, then validated in the humanised NOD\/SCID mouse CRPC model. Effects of compound 323-1 and 323-2 on STAT3 transcriptional activity were determined by the luciferase assay and protein levels by western blotting.<br \/><b>Results <\/b><i>In silico<\/i> computational modeling, DARTS and FP assays altogether determined 323-1 and 323-2 as direct STAT3 inhibitors targeting the STAT3 SH2 domain and inhibiting both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated STAT3 dimerization. Computational docking predicted that both 323 compounds bind to three subpockets of the STAT3 SH2 domain with full inhibition of STAT3. FP assay further confirmed that 323s target the STAT3 SH2 domain by competitively abrogating the interaction between STAT3 and the SH2-binding peptide GpYLPQTV. Compared with S3I-201, the 323 compounds exhibited stronger inhibition of STAT3 and reduced the level of IL-6-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr705) in LNCaP cells over the phosphorylation of STAT1 (Tyr701) induced by IFN-&#611; in PC3 cells or the phosphorylation of STAT1 (Ser727) in DU145 cells. Both compounds down-regulated STAT3 target genes MCL1 and cyclin D1. The in-vivo data supported that 323s significantly inhibited LNCaP cell generated CRPC tumor growth. Thus, the two compounds are promising leading compounds for the treatment of cancers with hyper-activated STAT3.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>Here we report that these compounds modulate the IL-6\/STAT3 pathway by 1) inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation on Tyr705 and 2) disruption of STAT3 dimerization by directly targeting its SH2 domain; 3) inhibition of STAT3 transcriptional activity. Thus, the compounds 323-1 and 323-2 are promising new leading compounds for therapeutic STAT3 inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/198aef1e-8025-4b9d-bdfe-d612ecdc4dc3\/@s03B8ZAS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"STAT3,Prostate cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13819"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yaping Hua<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Waqas Azeem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Margrete Øyan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karl-Henning Kalland<\/i><\/presenter>.

Typically, ADCs with better hydrophilicity are less prone to aggregation, and have lower systemic clearance, and greater anti-tumor activities and thus a larger therapeutic index. However, the need to incorporate lipophilic payloads with an enhanced bystander effects has posed significant challenges to ADC and linker design, especially at drug-antibody ratios of 8 and even 16higher. Here we present a novel ADC platform that can greatly improveimproves the hydrophilicity, physiochemical stability, and pharmacokinetics of ADCs conjugated to lipophilic payloads such as exatecan, MMAE, SN38 and EErribulin. All payloads which are allare expect to exhibit strong bystander effects.By introducing PEG, polyhydroxyl and\/or polycarboxyl groups, we generated hydrophilic linkers that enable site specific and, highly homogeneous conjugation of payloads to multiple prototypical antibodies at DAR 4, 8 and even 16. Compared. These ADCs were evaluated for their binding affinity, hydrophilicity, physiochemical stability, in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. In addition, comparisons were made with with theirthe corresponding naked unconjugated parent antibodies and conventional vedotin- and deruxtecan-based ADCs., these ADCs were evaluated for their binding affinity, hydrophilicity, physiochemical stability, in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. These novel ADCs were found to be stable at 37&#8451; for up to 30 days, after for at least 5 cycles of freeze-thaw, and at concentrations as high as 100 mg\/mL, as assessed by visual inspection, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Binding affinities of these ADCs to target-positive cell lines were similar to their corresponding naked unconjugated parent antibodies. These ADCs demonstrated strong tumor growth inhibition with single or repeated dosing in multiple tumor xenograft mouse models. The pharmacokinetic profiles of these ADCs are similar to those of the naked respective parent unconjugated antibodies. Assessments of ADCs using these new platform linkers in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated showed better tolerability than ADCs using the traditional drug linkers.In summary, our novel ADC platform enables conjugation of hydrophobic payloads at high DARs as high as 8 or 16 with favorable physiochemical properties, results in robust pharmacokinetics, strong potency in vivo, and better tolerability. Therefore the potential for a meaningful therapeutic window may be realized through this novel ADC platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e898d244-0889-42bc-8da3-603bf1d90d4f\/@s03B8ZAS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-11 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Chemistry,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13820"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haidong Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenke Qi II<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Wang III<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guobao Wang IV<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyue Chen V<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Gavrilyuk VI<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Han VII<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baiteng Zhao VII<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Shang VII<\/i><\/presenter>.

Their application has since been extended to cancer treatment. While the mechanism of action is still unknown, it was previously believed that Na<sup>+<\/sup>\/K<sup>+<\/sup> ATPase might play a crucial role in cancer mitigation. However, we recently reported that cardiac glycosides could specifically enhance the anti-cancer effect of chemotherapy in KRAS mutant lung cancer by inhibiting the DNA Damage Response (DDR), and these effects were independent of the Na<sup>+<\/sup>\/K<sup>+<\/sup> ATPase. Mechanistically, we showed that cardiac glycosides induced the degradation of UHRF1, an important player in promoting DNA double strand break (DSB) repair through homologous recombination. These results suggest the promise of derivatizing cardiac glycosides into potential chemo sensitizing agents. Yet, one of the major challenges with these compounds is their cardiotoxicity. This has created a need for developing a strategy to generate less cardiotoxic drugs that are effective in inhibiting the DNA damage response to safe and effective anticancer activity. Herein we report a multi-step synthetic route utilizing k-strophanthidin as the initial building block. A systematic structural design was applied that included modification of the sugar moiety, glycoside linker, stereochemistry, and lactone ring to create a library of O-glycosides and MeON-neoglycosides. These molecules were screened for anti-cancer properties by exploring their influence on the signaling\/expression of various downstream kinases in the DDR pathway. We discovered the inhibitory activity of O-glycosides to be more potent than the MeON-neoglycosides or benzylidene-lactone modified compounds. These results demonstrate the ability to chemically synthesize CG derivatives to optimize for anticancer activity with the goal of identifying less cardiotoxic CGs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e39f5309-973c-4085-ac98-f0a9a58a0f96\/@s03B8ZAS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13821"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Diana Ainembabazi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinran Geng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Navnath Gavande<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>YouWei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Turchi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, colorectal cancers (CRC) were classified into four consensus molecular types (CMS) [2], CMS 1 to 4. We carried out a translational study to investigate the anti-CRC activity of BO-2762 to various CMS subtypes.<br \/><b>Experimental Design:<\/b> We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the potency and selectivity of first-line combo like hybrid small molecule BO-2762 on a panel of CRC cell lines, which were classified into CMS-1 (LoVo &#38; DLD-1), CMS-2 (LS1034 &#38; SW116), CMS-3 (HT-29 &#38; LS174T), CMS-4 (SW620 &#38; CACO2) and several unclassified cell lines (HCT-116, RKO, &#38; COLO205). Immunohistochemistry was adopted to determine the DNA damage marker (&#947;H2AX) and blood vessel marker (CD31) in the tumor xenografts treated with BO-2762.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> BO-2762 alone has bifunctional activity by lodging DNA crosslinking in CRC cells and inhibiting tube formation of HUVEC cells at IC50 of 0.50 to 3 &#956;M range. Angiogenesis inhibition was possibly due to the suppression of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in HUVEC cells and the depletion of VEGF-A in the conditioned media. As reported in previous studies [3], we did not observe non-subtype specific cytotoxicity in in vitro assay system. Intriguingly, animal models exhibited their selective suppression on xenografts of various CMS-1 subtypes, e.g., remarkable suppression in CMS-1 LoVo cells (85.8%) and CMS-4 SW620 cells (83.0%), moderate in CMS-2 LS1034 cells (75.4%), and poor in CMS-3 HT29 cells (44.8%). BO-2762 was administrated at 20 mg\/kg via <i>i<\/i><i>v<\/i> injection. Furthermore, by immunohistochemically staining of &#947;H2AX and CD31, we found that BO-2762 was able to induce DNA damage in xenografts of all CMS subtypes but unable to suppress the angiogenesis in CMS-3 HT29 xenografts. Our preliminary results showed enriched VEGF-A and VEGFR2 in HT29 cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> CMS classification paves a medical platform to investigate the combination of anti-angiogenic and DNA crosslinking agents in the CRC selective treatment. BO-2762, a novel hybrid displaying anti-angiogenesis and induction of DNA damage, is functional similar to FOLFOX + Bevacizumab. CMS subtype-specific inhibition in xenografts was likely evented according to their expression levels of angiogenic signaling. Accordingly, BO-2762 has a great potential for further development as a potent and specific anti-CRC agent at least against CMS-1 and 4 subtypes. However, biomarker identification for selecting right patients warrants our further investigation.<br \/><b>References:<\/b>1) J Med Chem, 64 (2021) 12469-12486. 2) Nat Med, 21 (2015) 1350-1356. 3) Neoplasia, 22 (2020) 365-375.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Consensus Molecular Subtypes,DNA damage & Anti-angiogenesis,Anti-cancer hybrid drug ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13822"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vaikar Navakanth Rao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kuo-Chu Lai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chin-Huang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tsann-Long Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Te-Chang Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

Accumulating body of data in recent years have shown that active principles within various naturally-occurring dietary botanicals not only offer time-tested safety and anti-cancer efficacy, but a combination of certain compounds can overcome the elusive chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer patients. In this regard, data in recent years have shown that berberine (BBR) and oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) from the grape-seed extract have significant anti-tumorigenic properties in CRC, and a more recent study reported existence of synergism between these two natural medicines in patients with type 2 diabetes. Accordingly, herein we hypothesized that BBR and OPCs might regulate synergistically multiple oncogenic pathways to exert a superior anti-cancer activity in CRC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed a series of experiment in various cell lines, followed by their interrogation in patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to evaluate the synergistic anti-tumorigenic effects of BBR and OPCs in CRC cells. In addition, using genome-wide RNA sequencing analyses, we identified specific functional determinants and key targeted genes and pathways regulated by the combined therapeutic approach with these compounds.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> To confirm our hypothesis, we first evaluated the potential of OPCs to increase the cellular uptake of BBR in CRC cells, by measuring the fluorescent signal of BBR in multiple cell lines treated individually or their combination. The synergistic anti-tumorigenic effects of BBR and OPCs were observed in various functional assays including reduced cell viability, colony formation potential, wound healing, and invasion assays. Furthermore, the combined treatment with these compounds potentiated the cell apoptosis in an Annexin V binding assay. It was intriguing to note that we were able to successfully validate all cell culture findings in the PDO models from multiple CRC patients. Whole genome transcriptomic profiling identified oncogene MYB, including in PI3-AKT signaling pathway as one of the key pathways that was critically involved in mediating the anti-tumorigenic properties of this combined therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We for the first time demonstrate that a combined treatment with BBR and OPCs synergistically promotes the anti-tumorigenic properties in CRC. This synergism was potentially due to enhanced apoptosis and the regulation of oncogenic MYB in the PI3-Akt signaling pathway; hence, offering an attractive potential for the use of these two compounds as adjuvant treatment options in patients with CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2a3c90e-4dd4-4057-8017-1234ec1a4539\/@s03B8ZAS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Natural products,Synergism,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13825"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Keisuke Okuno<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachana Garg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masanori Tokunaga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yusuke Kinugasa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Goel<\/i><\/presenter>.

A hallmark of ATC is increased inflammatory cytokine expression and inflammatory cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment that is responsible for its aggressive nature. In contrast, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is well-differentiated and subsequently significantly less aggressive and more responsive to available therapies. The metabolic differences between ATC and PTC that correlate with differentiation status, and hence metastatic propensity, are poorly understood. Owing to its lack of differentiation, ATC is radioiodine therapy resistant, whereas differentiated thyroid cancers are susceptible. AMPK in the thyroid gland is responsible for glucose and iodine uptake. The AMPK pathway is a potential target for modulation due to the higher glucose uptake and metabolism associated with treatment resistance seen in ATC. Berberine, a naturally occurring plant alkaloid, regulates glycometabolism and lipid metabolism, improves energy expenditure, and reduces body weight. Exploration of a possible connection between the metabolic regulation displayed by BBR and AMPK&#945; expression was warranted. Increased AMPK&#945; signaling, observed through increased AMPK&#945; phosphorylation, has an anti-tumor effect. When comparing PTC (TPC1) and ATC (T238) cell lines there was a 4.75- and 2.34-fold change, respectively, in phosphorylation of AMPK&#945; upon BBR treatment. This demonstrates that BBR increases metabolic regulation in thyroid cancer cell lines, importantly, even when poorly differentiated. Further analysis of the correlation between differentiation status and metabolic characteristics between ATC and PTC was investigated using RNASeq. Differential gene expression was conducted to compare ATC and PTC using human thyroid cancer cell lines T238 and K1, respectively. These thyroid cancer cell lines were treated with 100 &#956;M BBR or the same concentration of DMSO as a vehicle control for 24 hours. RNA was isolated from T238 and K1 cells and RNASeq was conducted by GeneWiz. This differential gene expression will help identify specific genes that are regulating metabolic patterns and is currently ongoing. Berberine (BBR) is a natural compound used widely in Traditional Chinese Medicine for its many pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, metabolic, antioxidant, and anti-cancer. BBR may be able to mitigate the metabolic pattern of ATC to potentially affect differentiation status as an intervening product. Intervention of the differentiation status of ATC will impact its progression, specifically metastasis. Therefore, identifying gene patterns that correlate with differentiation status will identify novel intervention targets for BBR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e698787-af8c-4d9a-be18-368b99b83c69\/@t03B8ZAT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Natural products,Metabolism,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13826"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kaci Kopec<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tara Jarboe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mordechai Sternman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole R.

Resistance is often connected to the overexpression of the specific kinases that are involved in DNA damage response. Contrary, their inhibition could lead to augmented cancer cell sensitization to conventional approach. Among them, ataxia&#8209;telangiectasia and Rad3&#8209;related kinase (ATR), the major replication stress responder, is one of the most attractive target. Within this study our aim was to find novel chemosensitizing agents for the cancer treatment employment. Inspired by clinical candidates targeting ATR, we designed and prepared large library of 40 novel compounds utilizing 7-azaindoles, 2,7-diazaindoles, and 1<i>H<\/i>&#8209;pyrazoles as core structures. Initially, our presumption to have ATR inhibitors were confirmed by molecular dynamic study. All the compounds alone or in combination with cisplatin were screened against panel of nine cancer cell lines and one healthy cell line. The results were compared with well&#8209;known ATR inhibitor VE&#8209;821. Several compounds significantly inhibit the cell viability and some were able to potentiate cisplatin effect. From structure&#8209;activity relationship point of view, 7-azaindoles were the most cytotoxic compounds when substituted in position 3 and 5. Contrary, 2,7-diazaindoles expressed the most potent chemosensitizing capabilities. 1<i>H<\/i>&#8209;Pyrazoles were the least potent compounds within this screen. Interestingly, the status of tumor suppressor protein p53 (defect in G1) did not significantly influence chemosensitization or cytotoxic effect. Three highlighted compounds <b>3<\/b>, <b>22<\/b>, and <b>29<\/b> were selected for Broad oncology panel screening containing 104 kinases which could be potentially targeted. Only compound <b>29<\/b>,<b> <\/b>the 2,7-diazaindole representative, showed ATR inhibitory efficacy with the IC<sub>50<\/sub> around 10 &#181;M. In contrast, the compound <b>22<\/b>, 7-azaindole and the most cytotoxic one, expressed the multi&#8209;kinase activity with the substantial inhibitory capability against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 protein (VEGFR&#8209;3). VEGFR&#8209;3 is also very attractive anticancer target with several inhibitors already approved. Finally, several compounds showed chemosensitizing potencies for temozolomide against secondary astrocytoma cell line. In overall, we showed that both, 7-azaindoles, and 2,7-diazaindoles, could be effectively utilized as novel anticancer agents. Whereas 2,7-diazaindoles could become efficient ATR inhibitors, 7-azaindoles have potential as antiangiogenics, VEGFR&#8209;3 inhibitors. Besides, both structures could be used for a glioblastoma treatment as temozolomide sensitizers. More research is currently ongoing to fully exploit potential of these compounds.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f928fc78-8e58-476b-96fb-9f2f1fccaa5d\/@t03B8ZAT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemosensitization,DNA damage response,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13828"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lukas Gorecki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Darina Muthna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Merdita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Andrs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomas Kucera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tereza Kobrlova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Rezacova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Korabecny<\/i><\/presenter>.

Due to its loss of differentiation, ATC is resistant to radioiodine therapy, refractory to external beam radiation, and insufficiently treated by chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Berberine (BBR), a natural plant alkaloid, has vast pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer roles. BBR blocks proliferation, induces cell cycle arrest, promotes apoptosis, and hinders invasion and metastasis. BBR may also inhibit cell proliferation through miRNA interactions and regulate the TME through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Research in ATC using BBR is limited, specifically investigation on how BBR reprograms the inflammatory TME via altering miRNA cargo of secretory exosomes and polarization of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). ATC tissues have extensive infiltration of a mixed TAM population. In ATC, infiltration with classically anti-tumorigenic, inflammatory M1 macrophages has a pro-tumorigenic role. We assessed the secretory profile of ATC cells and found a high expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-1, MCP-1\/2, and MIP-1&#945;\/&#946; in ATC conditioned media (CM), supporting the existence of an inflammatory TME. As this chronic inflammation is partially mediated by the presence of M1 TAMs in the TME, we activated monocyte cell line U937 with TPA and polarized with IFN&#947; and LPS into an M1 phenotype. In the presence of BBR at the activation and polarization stages, inflammatory mediators IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-6R, CXCL9, MIP-1&#945;\/&#946;, and TNFR1\/2 were downregulated in the CM compared to M1 macrophages activated and polarized without BBR. BBR also appeared to prevent some level of activation and polarization of these cells into the M1 phenotype altogether. BBR may have an essential role in lessening the burden of inflammation in ATC through remodeling its tumor immune infiltrates, potentially priming it for greater success in combination therapy. Intervention prior to metastasis warrants secretome analysis to define ATC disease progression. Exosomal cargo, particularly miRNA, secreted by ATC cells was evaluated as exosomes have potential as biomarkers to detect ATC earlier improving prognosis, guide treatment, and avoid unneeded surgeries. Distinct miRNA expression from ATC-secreted exosomes compared to papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)-secreted exosomes revealed six miRNAs specifically downregulated in ATC-secreted exosomes that are known tumor suppressors. We are currently evaluating how BBR alters the miRNA profile of ATC- and PTC-secreted exosomes. The ability of BBR to alleviate inflammation in ATC and remodel its TME releases its chronic hold on ATC progression and may prime the tumor for increased responsiveness to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8cadd0c0-bffa-480c-80e0-b6f57436f331\/@t03B8ZAT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Inflammation,Tumor microenvironment,Natural products,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11512"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tara Jarboe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaci Kopec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole R.
