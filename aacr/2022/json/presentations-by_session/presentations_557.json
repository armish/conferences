[{"Abstract":"Breast Cancer (BC), the most common form of female cancer, is one of the most extensively studied diseases. Metastasis is the process by which a cancer cell travels to another part of the body and starts to multiply. This detrimental occurrence is one of the primary forms of disease relapse in cancer patients and accounts for an estimated 90 percent of cancer deaths. Ethnodyne Visio&#8482; is a new drug for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), the primary cause for blindness in people 65 and older. It is a mixture of phytochemicals Withaferin A, Gallic Acid, and Bacopaside I. However, the exact mechanism of action of Ethnodyne Visio&#8482; is not known. Macular Degeneration occurs in two primary forms: wet and dry. Wet Macular Degeneration shows surprising similarities with metastatic Breast Cancer in terms of their progression and causation. As both diseases evolve, the retina (in the case of Wet AMD) and the tumor (in the case of BC) secrete Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) to encourage vascular development. In Wet AMD, this new and unregulated vascular growth, or angiogenesis, causes &#8220;leaky&#8221; blood vessels that allow fluid to enter the retina, ultimately causing blindness. In BC, this blood vessel growth provides a means for the tumor to obtain nutrients as well as disseminate metastatic cells. We determined if there exists any easily accessible nutraceuticals possessing effective antiangiogenic properties. We used CAMs (chick chorioallantoic membrane), grown ex-ovo, to study angiogenesis. We found that Ashwagandha (Withaferin A) blocked angiogenesis of CAMs by 67%. Taking clues from these observations, we wanted to determine possible molecular signaling mechanisms triggered by Ethnodyne Visio&#8482; that may counter progression of BC. We hypothesized that Ethnodyne Visio&#8482; may have anti-angiogenic properties. Using multiple online gene association platforms, we compiled a list of transcriptomic changes caused by Withaferin A, Gallic Acid, and Bacopaside I on breast tumor cells. A g:Profiler analysis of the combined transcriptomic changes revealed Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling as a downstream target of the components of Ethnodyne Visio&#8482;. Our analysis reveals that Ethnodyne Visio&#8482; potentially regulates VEGF signaling through the EGFR pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/32c5fb81-2f4b-438e-8a3e-e92d3afc2746\/@w03B8ZTG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Angiogenesis,Natural products,Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18006"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rishab Rajeev Samant<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajeev Samant<\/i><\/presenter>.

Coagulation regulates inflammation and angiogenesis in cancer, and is associated with tumor development and metastasis. To date, there has been no measures to quantify the state of intra-tumoral coagulation. We hypothesized that intra-tumoral coagulation as quantified using coagulation score is associated with angiogenesis and worse prognosis in gastric cancer.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The coagulation score was determined by the Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) algorithm as GSVA score of the &#8220;HALLMARK_COAGULATION&#8221; in the MSigDB hallmark gene sets collection. Transcriptome data of 807 gastric cancer patients of TCGA_STAD and GSE84437 cohorts were used for the analysis.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We found that high coagulation score was significantly associated with high AJCC T-category (p = 0.018), lymph node metastasis status (p = 0.036), AJCC stage (p = 0.006) in the TCGA cohort. The association of the score with staging were validated by GSE84437 cohort. Further, patients with high score were associated with worse disease-specific survival and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.019 and 0.011, respectively) in the TCGA cohort, and OS in GSE84437 cohort (p = 0.012). Although the coagulation score was not associated with cell proliferation-related nor immune-related signaling, gastric cancer with high coagulation score highly enriched epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), myogenesis, apical junction, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#946; signaling, and angiogenesis consistently in both cohorts (all false discovery rate&#60;0.25). The coagulation score strongly correlated with angiogenesis score, and high coagulation was significantly associated with high infiltration of angiogenesis-related vascular cells, including endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes, calculated by xCell algorithm, as well as high expression of angiogenesis-related genes, including Endothelial cell marker, and vascular stability related genes.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Intra-tumoral coagulation assessed by coagulation score is associated with clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/27dc0690-bbbc-446f-9ea6-dfea3a132ea8\/@w03B8ZTG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Prognosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18007"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Masanori Oshi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joy Sarkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rongrong Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryusei Matsuyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Itaru Endo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuaki Takabe<\/i><\/presenter>.

It leads to diminish the efficacy radiation therapy. Traditional anti-angiogenesis strategies attempt to reduce the tumor vascular supply, but their success is restricted by insufficient efficacy or development of resistance. To solve the problem, we try to using PMC-403, which can normalize the abnormal condition of tumor vessel.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures<\/b><b>:<\/b> Target selectivity: It was measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assay. Human TIE2 Cho-K1 cells or mouse TIE2 Cho-K1 cells were tested for species cross-reactive assay based on flow cytometry (FACS).In vitro studies: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used for TIE2 signal pathway analysis with western blot assay and efficacy analysis with VEGF-induced vessel permeability assay.In vivo study: Glioblastoma model mice were employed for the assessment of tumor vessel normalizing activity of 1 mg\/mouse PMC-403. CT26 colon cancer model mice were used to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of PMC403 (10 mg\/kg) in combination with radiation therapy. Hypoxyprobe was used to measure the improvement of hypoxic conditions in tumor tissue.<br \/><b>Summary of data<\/b><b>:<\/b> PMC-403 has a nanomolar range of affinity for both human or mouse TIE2 expressing cells. This contributed to dose-dependent ANG1-like TIE2 and FOXO1 phosphorylation and inhibited VEGF-induced vascular leakage, thereby contributing to ANG1-like vascular normalization. Moreover, similar to ANG-1, p-VEGFR2 and p-VE-Cadherin levels were significantly reduced by PMC-403, suggesting that PMC-403 can normalize blood vessels. In addition, PMC-403 stabilized abnormal tumor blood vessels in the glioblastoma mouse model and significantly reduced tumor growth and tumor hypoxia in the combination treatment (PMC-403 + radiation therapy) compared to radiation therapy alone, although the antitumor effect of PMC-403 alone was not effective in the same condition model.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> PMC-403, an anti-TIE2 monoclonal antibody, is a novel tumor vessel stabilizer. PMC-403 improved tumor microenvironment hypoxic condition that synergized with radiotherapy when it combined together for the anticancer therapy. These data strongly support the notion that PMC-403 can effectively treat tumors even with low doses of radiation by stabilizing tumor blood vessels.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/096d5578-8f5a-4c57-b4db-8991e0a678a1\/@w03B8ZTG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,tumor vessel normalization,Hypoxia,TIE2 receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18008"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eun-Ah Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beom Yong Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nuri Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheon Ho Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weon Sup Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here, we find that high transcript levels of <i>DEPDC1B<\/i> in cutaneous melanomas are significantly associated with a poor prognosis. Tissue microarray analysis indicates DEPDC1B expression is positively correlated with SOX10 in the different stages of melanoma. Consistently, DEPDC1B is both required and sufficient for melanoma growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and functions as a direct downstream target of SOX10 to partly mediate its oncogenic activity. In contrast to other tumor types, the DEPDC1B-mediated enhancement of melanoma metastatic potential is not dependent on the activities of RHO GTPase signaling and canonical Wnt signaling, but is acquired through secretion of SCUBE3, which is crucial for promoting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DEPDC1B regulates SCUBE3 protein stability through the competitive association with ubiquitin ligase CDC16 to prevent SCUBE3 from undergoing degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Importantly, expression of SOX10, DEPDC1B, and SCUBE3 are positively correlated with microvessel density in the advanced stage of melanomas. In conclusion, we reveal a SOX10-DEPDC1B-SCUBE3 regulatory axis promotes melanoma angiogenesis and metastasis, which suggests targeting secreted SCUBE3 can be a therapeutic strategy against metastatic melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aa7c4e1b-a920-4169-9f5c-15bab60e01b2\/@w03B8ZTG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-03 Molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Angiogenesis,Metastasis,Invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18009"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Feng Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ki On Fong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>May P.L Cheung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica A.J Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tsz Wai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakesh Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip P.C Ip<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xintao Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Martin Cheung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We also found that the 10,000 &#215; <i>g <\/i>pellet fraction of the LNCaP-derived conditioned medium containing PSMA-positive membranes, including microvesicles, transformed HUVECs from &#8220;PSMA-negative&#8221; to &#8220;PSMA-positive.&#8221; Mass spectrometry revealed that the fraction contained an important growth factor. Furthermore, treating HUVECs with the 10,000 &#215; g pellet fraction of the LNCaP-derived conditioned medium significantly promoted tube formation, mimicking angiogenesis in a PSMA-dependent manner.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our findings revealed the existence of PSMA-positive tumor endothelial cells in human prostate tumors, which enhances tumor angiogenesis in prostate cancer tissues. The endocytic process of the PSMA-positive microvesicles in normal endothelial cells may be an attractive target to develop novel anti-angiogenic drugs, which could inhibit transformation of normal endothelial cells to tumor endothelial cells (Watanabe et al., <i>The Prostate<\/i>. 2021. in press).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d671580e-bffd-4b49-ac94-c3e62a78b89c\/@w03B8ZTG\/mp4?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-03 Molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Angiogenesis,Endothelial cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21730"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>RYUTA WATANABE<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>MASASHI MAEKAWA<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>TAKASHI KIYOI<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>MIE KURATA<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>NORIYOSHI MIURA<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>TADAHIKO KIKUGAWA<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>SHIGEKI HIGASHIYAMA<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>TAKASHI SAIKA<\/i><\/presenter>.
