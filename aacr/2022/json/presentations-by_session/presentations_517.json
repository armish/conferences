[{"Abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are comprised of lipid bound vesicles secreted by cells into the extracellular environment with various roles in cell-to-cell communication. Recent studies have implicated EVs in cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, angiogenesis, and mediating the interaction of tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. To systematically characterize the EVs associated with pancreatic cancer, we performed proteomic and functional analyses on the protein contents of EVs released from pancreatic cancer lines, CAF cell lines and a normal pancreatic epithelial cell line. More than 1400 non-redundant proteins were identified in each EV proteome derived from these cell lines. The common EV proteins identified in these cell lines were enriched in biological processes such as vesicle-mediated transport and exocytosis. Protein networks relevant to pancreatic tumorigenesis, such as of EMT, complement and coagulation components, were significantly enriched in the EVs from cancer cells or CAFs in comparison to normal pancreatic epithelial cells. These findings support the roles of EVs as a potential mediator in transmitting EMT signals and complement response in the tumor microenvironment and possibly contributing to coagulation defects related to cancer development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1252f8ee-4d1c-4a66-babc-b02262617ec1\/@p03B8ZQa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Extracellular vesicles,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17488"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sharon Pan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa A.

The composition of gut flora and its interaction with mucosal cells plays a key role in the development of IBD and colorectal cancer. However, the actual cause-effect relationship between dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and human IBD and associated colorectal cancer has not been well established. In the current study, we sought to characterize colon mucosa adherent microbiota using metaproteomics to understand the colon micro-environment and the host-microbiome interactions. Three groups of colon biopsies were included in our analysis: healthy controls, Non-progressors (IBD patients without dysplasia or cancer) and Progressors (IBD patients who have dysplasia or cancer). The biopsy samples were analyzed by LC MS\/MS and the bacterial proteins were identified using the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) human gut microbiome database. The inferences of bacterial taxonomy, bacterial enzymes and Gene ontology (GO) pathways were processed through Unipept. Examining bacterial composition between different sample groups showed no statistically significant difference at the levels of phyla and classes. However, a significant reduction of Holdemanella biformis was observed when comparing Progressors vs Non-progressors. Holdemanella biformis has recently been proposed to be endogenous anti-tumourigenic bacterial strains. Decrease of this bacterial species in Progressors suggested that it may be a protective bacteria preventing the progression of IBD associated colorectal cancer. Analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes identified GO terms that were significantly different among the Progressor, Non-progressor and healthy groups. For example, the GO term &#8216;detoxification of arsenic containing substances&#8217; was significantly underrepresented in the Progressor group compared to healthy and Non-progressor groups. Furthermore, several bacterial enzymes were significantly different between the three groups. In particular, oxidoreductases were significantly decreased in the Progressor group compared to healthy and Non-progressor groups. While the implications of these significantly enriched or depleted bacterial biological processes and bacterial enzymes in the neoplastic progression of IBD warrant further investigation, the results from our current study provide new insight into understanding how gut microbiota as a modulator of microenvironment may contribute to progression of IBD-associated colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bdf4b3f5-7a40-4712-90db-27fd5f78b6e2\/@q03B8ZQb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammatory bowel disease,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Microbiome,Mass spectrometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17489"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nobel Bhasin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prerna Dabral<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victoria Poplaski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Lai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong-Yuan Tsai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Bronner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa Brentnall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Valentine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordon March<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antone Opekun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Britton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pan Sheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ru Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the majority of patients develop resistance within one year of treatment. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance is urgently needed to overcome trastuzumab resistance. This study explored the characteristics of trastuzumab resistant cell lines through comparative proteome analysis.<br \/>We previously reported establishment of four trastuzumab resistant cell lines from HER2 amplified GC cell lines by trastuzumab dose-escalation treatment; YCC-33TR, YCC-38TR, NCI-N87TR, and SNU-216TR. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were obtained 10 GC patients prior to trastuzumab therapy. The patients were first stratified into poor and good responders based on whether their tumors had or had not progressed. For analysis of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), label-free quantitative proteomic profiling was performed using high-resolution LC-MS system. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using DAVID database.<br \/>Consistent with the previous results, we found that HER2 expression in TR cell lines remained as high as parental cell lines, also in proteomic profiling. As a result of proteomic analysis, total 5285 proteins were identified in 4 parental and 4 TR cell lines; 4854 common proteins, while 55 proteins unique to parental cell lines and 58 proteins unique to TR cell lines. Then, we did the hierarchical clustering with these DEPs to identify protein expression patterns. We observed that 129 and 62 proteins were upregulated in parental and TR cell lines, respectively (p&#60;0.05). We identified C5orf51 and CENP-E, poor prognostic factors, were upregulated 200-fold in TR cell lines. Interestingly, we found that HLA-B, ITM2C, and PPP1R3D were highly expressed in TR cell lines and trastuzumab poor responders.<br \/>In conclusion, we performed comparative proteome analysis in parental and TR cell lines and investigated the corresponding expression change. It may gain further novel insights into the mechanisms of trastuzuamb resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72ac346c-b069-4cca-815a-b446643bba2d\/@q03B8ZQb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Trastuzumab,HER2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17490"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juin Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woo Sun Kwon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Kyoung Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Soo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jihyun Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Woo Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyunggon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Cheol Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Young Rha<\/i><\/presenter>.

There is extensive literature on the use of various types of mouse models for biomarker discovery and drug testing. Only a few studies have examined the association between soluble immune checkpoint proteins and the immune status. Following the development of multiplex immunoassay panels for profiling human co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoint proteins, here we report the development of a novel magnetic bead-based Luminex multiplex assay for the quantitative detection of 28 mouse immune checkpoint proteins and immune regulators in 25 &#956;L of sample (PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4\/CD152, TIM-3, LAG-3, B7-H2\/ICOSL, B7-H3\/CD276, BTLA, GITR, HVEM, CD27, CD40, CD80\/B7-1, CD226\/DNAM-1, 4-1BBL\/TNFSF9, CD137\/4-1BB, 5&#8217;-NT\/CD73, BCA-1\/CXCL13, CD25\/IL-2R&#945;, Granzyme B, E-cadherin, Galectin-1, Galectin-3, IFN&#947;, IL-10, TLR-2, and TNF&#945;). Immune function declines with age, while the incidence of cancer rises. In this study, we examined age-related serum samples by quantitative profiling soluble checkpoint proteins from young (age of 8-month-old, n=8) and old-aged mice (48-month-old, n=8) of C57BL\/6 strain. A significant age effect was observed on the levels of soluble checkpoint proteins in mouse serum samples tested. Comparing with the young mice, decreased levels of circulating HVEM, Granzyme B, LAG-3, PD-L1, CD73, B7-H2, CD25, and CD27; and increased levels of circulating TIM-3, PD-1, PD-L2, CD40, Galectin-3, IL-10, BCA-1, and TLR-2 were observed in aged C57BL\/6 mice (Mann Whitney test, P value &#60;0.05). The immune system also changes during pregnancy. We used the similar multiplex array approach to profile the soluble checkpoint proteins in non-pregnant (n=16) and pregnant CD-1 mice (n=9). Significant decreased levels of soluble LAG-3, B7-H2, B7-H3, CD25, CD27, and Galectin-1; and significant increase of soluble CD137, Galectin-3, and CD73 expression levels were detected in the serum samples of pregnant mice, as compared to the samples from the non-pregnant mice (Mann Whitney test, P value &#60;0.05). Altogether, using bead-based quantitative multiplex analysis, our results demonstrate that the changes on circulating immune checkpoint protein profiles occur in the immunologic adaptations with age and during pregnancy in mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d569198d-8500-4f3e-baa0-cebb4cef198f\/@q03B8ZQb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immune checkpoint,Protein profiling,Mouse,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18451"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wen-Rong Lie<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Kornmeier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ling Zeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Hoberg<\/i><\/presenter>.

Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with the formation of ascites. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been elucidated to play a pivotal role in cancer development and progression, also emerging as promising resources for clinical biomarkers in liquid biopsy. In this study, we aim to identify cancer-specific protein biomarkers in ascites-derived EVs for ovarian cancer diagnosis. Malignant ascites from high grade ovarian cancer patients (HGSOC) and benign peritoneal fluids from female patients with benign gynecologic diseases were collected with informed consent. EVs were isolated from these biofluids using the Exoquick kit. Meanwhile, HGSOC cell lines and normal cell lines were cultured in conditioned media supplemented with EVs-depleted FBS. EVs were isolated from the culture media. Proteins were extracted from EVs and fragmented into peptides. Tandem mass tag (TMT) hyper multiplex quantitation assay was carried out to detect the EV proteomic profiling. EVs isolated from biofluids and cell culture media were identified as double-membrane nanoparticles sizing ranging from 30nm to 200nm. Proteomic analysis of biofluids-derived EVs showed that malignant ascites-derived EVs displayed different proteomic profiling compared to benign peritoneal fluids-derived EVs. The differently expressed proteins between malignant ascites-derived EVs and benign peritoneal fluids-derived EVs were defined as candidate EV protein biomarkers. In addition, proteins that were expressed in at least one cancer cell line-derived EVs but not expressed in normal cell line-derived EVs were also identified as ovarian cancer-specific proteins. A diagnostic model constructed based on the integrative analysis of candidate EV protein biomarkers and ovarian cancer-specific proteins yielded a good discrimination ability between benign and cancer patients.In conclusion, this study demonstrates the distinct proteomic profiling in ascites- and cancer cell-derived EVs in ovarian cancer, which sheds new light on implementing EV proteins as a potential diagnostic strategy in clinical settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9431c9f6-15bb-46b9-a287-973c74877477\/@q03B8ZQb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Ascites fluid,Proteomic analysis,Extracellular vesicles,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18452"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wenyu Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dohyun Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Sang Song<\/i><\/presenter>.

EVs circulating in blood contain a wealth of biomarkers that are thought to reflect the tumor&#8217;s proteome; however, detecting the full diversity of EV proteins may depend on choice of method to purify EVs for analysis. We compared an ACE microarray isolation method with a conventional chemical precipitation method to isolate EVs from blood plasma cancer and control samples. EVs were isolated from 1 mL each of control or pancreatic cancer patient plasma using the ExoVerita platform (Biological Dynamics) or ExoQuick Ultra kit (System Biosciences). Purified EVs were processed using tandem mass tag (TMT)-based multiplexing mass spectrometry proteomics (ThermoFisher Scientific) and the resulting peptide spectra were analyzed and quantified to determine the proteins present. Additional analyses, such as bioanalyzer measurements of contaminating plasma proteins and nanoparticle tracking analysis were performed in parallel to further characterize the isolated EVs. Cancer EVs isolated by ACE were enriched in proteins related to cancer functions when compared to non-cancer control EVs. They also showed enrichment in ontology clusters such as NABA core matrisome proteins, with depressed expression of wound healing family proteins. In contrast, EVs isolated using chemical purification demonstrated enrichment chiefly in proteins functionally grouped into immune system or blood regulation functions. After analyzing EVs isolated by ACE, a total of fifty-one (51) proteins were observed to be upregulated in the cancer donor samples. EV isolation method choice significantly impacted the proteomic profile observed. EV isolation using ACE-based technology can provide more insights into understanding the proteome by possibly reducing or removing non-specific proteins from the EVs. With better separation of EVs from blood proteins, the EV proteins identified may have greater biological significance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b9c50ce3-9efa-4d1d-a953-7379031427c3\/@q03B8ZQb\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mass spectrometry,Extracellular vesicles,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18453"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Juan P.

The goal of CPTAC is to improve prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer by enhancing the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer, advancing proteogenome science and technology development through community resources, and accelerating the translation of molecular findings into the clinic. Using state-of-the-art high throughput standardized mass spectrometry-based methods, the Proteogenomic Tumor Characterization Program performs deep comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of cancer types with all data and assays to be released to the research community. CPTAC teams have characterized a plethora of treatment-na&#239;ve tumor types including colorectal, ovarian, breast, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, brain (including adult, pediatric, and adolescent and young adult), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In the Proteogenomic Translational Research Program, CPTAC is partnering for the first time with NCI-sponsored clinical trials to support clinically relevant research projects that would elucidate biological mechanisms of therapeutic response, resistance, and\/or toxicity. The Proteogenomic Translational Research Program currently explores triple negative breast cancer, high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. All mass spectrometry-based proteomic, genomic, and imaging data (histopathology and radiology) are made publicly available at the CPTAC Proteomic Data Commons (https:\/\/pdc.cancer.gov), Genomic Data Commons (https:\/\/gdc.cancer.gov), and the Cancer Imaging Archive (<u>https:\/\/cancerimagingarchive.net<\/u>) respectively. CPTAC is also supporting development of new proteogenomic data analysis tools (https:\/\/proteomics.cancer.gov\/resources\/computational-tools). In addition, the CPTAC Assay Portal (http:\/\/assays.cancer.gov) is a public resource populated with mass spectrometry-based targeted proteomic assays developed by the consortium for quantitatively measuring proteins of interest, including those discovered through comprehensive tumor characterization.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is used to identify genetic variants and characterize gene function (e.g. transcriptome and epigenome), while mass spectrometry is used to assess the proteome through characterization of protein abundances, modifications, and interactions. A new plasma profiling platform, the Proteograph<sup>TM<\/sup> Product Suite, leverages multiple nanoparticles with distinct physiochemical properties to enable deep plasma proteome analyses at scale. Here, we present a cloud-based, data analysis software platform called Proteograph Analysis Suite (PAS) for proteogenomic data analyses through the integration of proteomics data derived from the Proteograph with genomic variant information derived from NGS experiments. PAS features include an experiment data management system, analysis protocols, an analysis setup wizard, and tools for reviewing and visualizing results. PAS can support both Data Independent Analysis (DIA) and Data Dependent Analysis (DDA) proteomics workflows and is compatible with variant call format (vcf) files from NGS workflows to enable personalized database searches. To assess quality of the resulting data PAS includes various metrics like peptide\/protein group intensity, protein sequence coverage, relative protein abundance distribution, peptide and protein group counts. Visualizations including principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and heatmaps allow intuitive identification of experimental trends. To enable biological insights, differential expression analyses results are reported with interactive visualizations such as volcano plots, protein interaction maps, and protein-set enrichment. From data to insight, PAS provides an easy-to-use and efficient suite of functionality to enable proteogenomic data analysis. Integration of proteomics and genomics data require a variety of tools, many of which require command-line interfaces and operating system-specific requirements that can act as a barrier for researchers to adapt new data analysis tools. Here, we demonstrate the utility of PAS by analyzing samples from the Proteograph NSCLC plasma dataset<sup>1<\/sup>. PAS can analyze VCF files generated from NGS pipelines in combination with mass spec data to identify peptide variants using personalized libraries. Using the cloud-based architecture computational tasks are distributed for rapid analysis. The integrated proteogenomics viewers allow variant IDs to be interpreted in the context of genomic coordinates, protein sequence, functional domains and features. Together, these results show the utility of PAS for seamless and fast proteomic data analysis. Reference: <sup>1 <\/sup>Blume, J.

Since the RNA functions are dependent on its molecular structure, cellular activities that involve specific RNA molecule(s) can potentially be regulated by the reversible nature of RNA modifications. There are more than 140 known RNA modifications. Mass spectrometry is a proven technique for the identification of RNA modifications. However, due to the lack of ribonucleoside standards and biases in normalizing the level of RNA modifications, it remains a challenge to perform the quantitative analysis of multiple RNA modifications that may co-exist in a biological sample. Our group has recently developed a method for standard-free quantitative epitranscriptomic profiling (SqEP) that allows us using mass spectrometry to accurately determine the abundancy of each detectable RNA modification without using any ribonucleoside standards to calibrate the detection signals. Thus, the SqEP method can be used for the untargeted analysis of RNA modifications. It also allows us to directly compare the level of different RNA modifications that are detectable in an individual cell line. This is an important feature for studying the relationships between various RNA modifications. Using glioblastoma (GBM) as our model, the results from using the SqEP method to determine the level of specific RNA modifications in patient-derived GBM cell lines were shown to be more accurate than the existing methods, and complied with the gene expression data from GBM patients that are available in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/874b96f0-547d-4a78-8249-3946aad5b660\/@q03B8ZQb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-01 Biological mass spectrometry and systems biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,Modifications,Mass spectrometry,Profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19992"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Norman H.
