[{"Abstract":"ONC201 (originally discovered as TRAIL-Inducing Compound #10 or TIC10) and analogue ONC206 have been found to induce an integrated stress response with suggested primary targets and mechanisms involving agonist activity against mitochondrial ClpP and antagonism of dopamine receptors D2\/3 (DRD2\/3). We hypothesized that dopamine, the agonist of DRD2, may compete with ONC201 or ONC206 for DRD2\/3 and impair the anti-cancer effect of ONC201 or ONC206. We therefore pre-treated cancer cells from different tissue origins including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, GBM, and DIPG with dopamine for 12 hours, 24 hours or 48 hours, respectively, followed by treatment of ONC201 or ONC206 for 72hours. Cell viability was determined by the CellTiter Glo assay. Single treatment with dopamine did not increase cell viability. We observed that 48 hours of pre-treatment with dopamine at 50 &#956;M, 100 &#956;M or 200 &#956;M impaired the cell viability suppression effect of ONC201 at 4 &#956;M and 8 &#956;M, while ONC206 at 0.5 &#956;M, 1 &#956;M and 2 &#956;M led to similar protection for loss of cell viability in pancreatic cancer cells. The impairment of the anti-cancer effect by dopamine was also observed in colorectal cancer cells with 48 hours pre-treatment with dopamine at 50 &#956;M, 100 &#956;M, 200 &#956;M or 400 &#956;M and treatment with ONC201 at 4 &#956;M and 8 &#956;M, or ONC206 at 0.5 &#956;M, 1 &#956;M, or 2 &#956;M. In addition, we treated pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer cells with ONC212 after 48 hours pre-treatment with dopamine and observed a similar impairment of the anti-cancer effect, even though ONC212 is not a DRD2 antagonist. We pre-treated pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer cells with specific DRD2 agonist, sumanirole, for 48 hours followed by treatment of ONC201, ONC206, or ONC212 for 72 hours, and no impairment was seen. We pre-treated multiple cancer cell lines with 2 &#956;M or 10 &#956;M dopamine for one week followed by ONC201, ONC206, or ONC212 treatment and performed colony assays. Pre-treatment with dopamine at 10 &#956;M impaired the anti-cancer effect of ONC201 or ONC206 in pancreatic cancer. Pre-treatment with dopamine at 2 &#956;M or 10 &#956;M impaired the anti-tumor effect of ONC201 in GBM cells. By contrast to the cell viability result, no impairment of ONC212 effect from dopamine was seen in pancreatic cancer cells. Western blotting was conducted to investigate whether dopamine pre-treatment impacted signaling pathways reported to be affected by ONC201. Dopamine pre-treatment did not impact changes induced by ONC201 in ATF4, CHOP, DR5, ClpX, clpP, pERK, pAkt and pS6. We are pursuing whether the protective effect of dopamine is due to the agonism of DRD2 or alternative pro-survival mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4c5f76c6-8d3c-4f31-b1f1-7113df0e4151\/@z03B8ZF2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ONC201,Glioblastoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21589"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yiqun Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wafik S.

EGFRvIII, a mutant version of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is constitutively active and not present in normal brain cells. The tumor specificity of EGFRvIII and the frequent EGFR amplification seen in GBM make EGFR a potentially attractive therapeutic target; however, clinical studies have shown little to no efficacy for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). One reason for this lack of efficacy may be adaptive resistance. We used RNA sequencing and multiplexed inhibitor beads with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS) to study the transcriptomes and kinomes of genetically engineered mouse astrocytes to investigate this resistance and identify potential targets for dual inhibition. Out of 329 kinases detected by MIB-MS, 76 were differentially expressed between cells with <i>Cdkn2a <\/i>deletion (&#8220;C&#8221;) and cells that also overexpressed EGFRvIII (&#8220;CEv3&#8221;). Thirty-four of these kinases were overexpressed in the CEv3 cells relative to the parental C cells (log2 fold change of 5.6, p&#60;1x10<sup>5<\/sup>). One of these kinases, Cdk6, is also significantly overexpressed in CEv3 cells versus cells that have a further loss of function mutation of <i>Pten<\/i> (&#8220;CEv3P&#8221;) (log2 fold change of 5.6, p&#60;1x10<sup>5<\/sup>). Despite this significant differential expression at the protein level, RNA expression of <i>Cdk6 <\/i>was similar between cell lines. When these cells were treated with the CDK6 inhibitor abemaciclib, CEv3 cells were found to be significantly more sensitive to inhibition than C and CEv3P cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.10 &#956;M vs. 0.18 &#956;M and 0.23 &#956;M, respectively). Similarly, when cells were treated with abemaciclib in combination with the EGFR inhibitor neratinib, there was significantly higher synergy in CEv3 cells than C or CEv3P cells. Genotypically-matched patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells were assayed for EGFR-CDK6 inhibitor synergy and showed a similar pattern of greater synergy in cells with EGFRvIII overexpression and functional PTEN than cells with EGFRvIII overexpression and PTEN loss. CEv3 and CEv3P cells were orthotopically implanted into mice and treated with neratinib, abemaciclib, or a combination. In CEv3-injected mice, combination treatment led to significantly longer survival than either single agent or control treatment. However, in CEv3P-injected mice, no survival difference was seen between any of the treatment arms. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that CDK6 is a promising target for combination treatment with EGFR inhibitors in glioblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc333f57-580a-4858-9bcd-88cfd4b190a0\/@z03B8ZF2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Cell cycle mechanisms of anticancer drug action,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,EGFR,CDK4\/6,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16278"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erin Smithberger<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abigail K.

All patients experience either permanent toxicity from standard therapy or death from recurrent disease. To address this unmet need for more effective and less toxic therapy, we performed a high throughput drug screen comparing drug efficacy in HPV+ and HPV- cell lines. We tested the drug sensitivity of 864 unique drugs (0-3.1 &#181;M) divided into 51 classes based on their targets in 33 squamous cancer cell lines using a parameter that is independent of cell division. Only one class of drugs, Aurora kinase inhibitors, was more effective in HPV+ than HPV- cell lines. To validate our screening results, we tested two Aurora kinase inhibitors (Alisertib, Barasertib) and observed significant cell death in HPV+ cells, but not in HPV- cells. Alisertib reduced tumor volume in HPV+ PDX mouse models without toxicity. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we compared the expression of ~300 proteins, using RPPA, to drug efficacy and validated the results using immunoblotting. The expression of Rb, pRb(S807\/811), and p16 correlated with drug sensitivity. To establish role for Rb, we used a bidirectional approach to manipulate RB1. Reduction in RB1 levels using either shRNA or stable E7 overexpression in HPV- cells resulted in increased Alisertib-induced apoptosis. We also used siRNA to knock down E7 expression in two HPV+ cell lines which resulted in elevated levels of Rb, thereby rescuing the cells from Alisertib-induced apoptosis. Studies have shown Rb-deficient cells have elevated levels of the mitotic-checkpoint protein MAD2, that may impact cell fitness. To test the role of MAD2, we depleted the levels of MAD2 and observed diminishing levels of cyclin B1 accumulation and reduced Alisertib-induced apoptosis. Additionally, we altered the activated levels of MAD2 protein by overexpression of TRIP13 that resulted in partially rescuing cells from undergoing Alisertib-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that Rb- deficient MAD2 overexpressing cells require a finely tuned balance of MAD2 and TRIP13 levels for their mitotic exit. Furthermore, we observed combined inhibition of TRIP13 with Aurora A led to more apoptosis in Rb-deficient cells than the single agents. Our results demonstrate that Rb-deficient cancers are sensitive to Aurora A inhibition due to an imbalance between MAD2 and TRIP13. Based on the above finding, our present study shows that TRIP13 inhibition in combination with Aurora kinase inhibitors leads to more apoptosis and can pave a path for novel therapies in the management of HPV+ tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c4a2d268-4070-449e-8c4d-d8cba8b21689\/@z03B8ZF2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Aurora kinase,Retinoblastoma protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16280"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Soma Ghosh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tuhina Mazumdar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reid T.

Mechanisms of activation include MYC gene amplification, mutation or rearrangement and have been reported to be prevalent in gynecologic malignancies, such as serous ovarian (39.2%), uterine (28.1%) and endometrial (19.5%) (https:\/\/www.cancer.gov\/tcga). Since CDK9 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II is required for transcription of Myc mRNA, we evaluate VIP152, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor (L&#252;cking et al 2021), to deliver antitumor responses in preclinical models of gynecologic malignancies.<br \/>Methods: Gynecologic cell lines were treated with 9 dose levels of VIP152 with DMSO and cisplatin as controls. IC50 were calculated using CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay after 72 hours treatment. A preliminary analysis of 19 cell lines was undertaken to determine whether response to VIP152 is associated with baseline mutation, gene expression, or copy number variation data. Monotherapy efficacy of VIP152 was evaluated in a cisplatin sensitive A2780 <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft mouse model.<br \/>Results: Screening of gynecologic cell lines demonstrates a 3-log range of sensitivity with VIP152 IC50s ranging from 38-593nM. Simultaneous cisplatin screening identified sensitive and resistant cell lines in the same panel. Low VIP152 IC50s were observed in cell lines sensitive or resistant to cisplatin. Cell lines were assigned as sensitive and resistant based on the VIP152 IC50 values. Preliminary analysis suggests a gene signature could predict response to VIP152 in gynecologic malignancies. VIP152 was evaluated in an ovarian cancer A2780 <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft model. Monotherapy treatment with 4 doses of VIP152 across 5 dose levels from 5- to 15-mg\/kg weekly regimens provided increasing tumor growth inhibition compared with vehicle control.<br \/>Conclusions: VIP152 demonstrates sensitivity in gynecologic cell lines independent of cisplatin sensitivity. An interim gene signature that is associated with VIP152 sensitivity was defined and we plan to optimize this signature with a larger cell line panel. Dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in an <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft model is demonstrated. VIP152 is currently being evaluated in the clinic (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02635672 and NCT04978779). References: Gabay et al. 2014. Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 4(6):a014241.

We have developed a novel strategy to kill CDK4i resistant tumor cells using a therapeutic liposomal:peptide formulation, NP-ALT, to inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of p27Kip1(CDKN1B), which in turn inhibits both CDK4\/6 and CDK2. IpY is specific for p27, and this reduces toxicity relative to that seen with the small molecule ATP-competitive CDK4\/6i or CDK2i. NP-ALT blocks DNA replication in HR+ breast cancer (BC) cells and mouse models, but unlike CDK4\/6i or CDK2i treatment, it induces ROS-dependent necroptosis to kill the tumor cells. This RIPK1\/RIPK3-dependent cell death is more specific for HR+ lineages, but the combination of NP-ALT and palbociclib in TNBC cells causes synergy to induce necroptosis. We found that NP-ALT was still able to induce necroptosis in cell lines resistant to palbociclib, including those harboring genetic perturbations detected clinically in patients resistant to palbociclib. HR+ cell lines engineered to overexpress CDK6, FGFR, cyclin E, or cyclin D or ones that have loss of FAT1 or RB were still sensitive to NP-ALT. We tested other CDK2i, including CYC065, a CDK2\/9 inhibitor and PF-06873600, a CDK4\/6\/2 inhibitor, and and found that while they were able to block DNA replication, only NP-ALT was able to induce ROS-dependent death in the resistant lines. We have shown that IpY reduces tumor volumes in resistant in vivo models as well, without causing adverse effects. Thus, NP-ALT and p27 targeting has several differentiators, which might provide clinical advantages: a) its low toxicity due to the tight specificity of the peptide for the p27 target and b) its ability to kill tumor cells as opposed to just causing cytostasis. Concarlo is currently developing NP-ALT into a therapeutic lead for the treatment of drug-resistant breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0648059c-1a88-40a7-9bc1-8707b1bcd098\/@A03B8ZF3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Cell cycle mechanisms of anticancer drug action,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Cell death,CDK2,p27KIP1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16284"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stacy Wister Blain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arianna Chand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lina Pedraza-Ortiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison VanInwegen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lingyu Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irina Jilishitz<\/i><\/presenter>.

To comprehensively determine TROP2 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, a tissue microarray containing 18,563<b> <\/b>samples from 150 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. TROP2 positivity was found in most normal epithelial cell types and in 109 of 150 tumor categories, including 92 of 95 epithelial tumor categories. Particularly high rates of TROP2 positivity and highest expression levels were seen in squamous cell carcinomas of various origins and various categories of urothelial, breast, prostate, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers (&#62;95% positive). High TROP2 expression was linked to advanced stage (p=0.0069) and nodal metastasis (p&#60;0.0001) in colorectal cancer as well as to nodal metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma (p=0.0246) and papillary thyroid cancer (p=0.0013). Low TROP2 expression was linked to advanced stage in urothelial carcinoma (p&#60;0.0001), high pT (p=0.0024) and high grade (p&#60;0.0001) in breast cancer, as well as with high grade (p=0.0005) and pT stage (p=0.0009) in papillary renal cell carcinomas. Associations between TROP2 expression and clinicopathological features were not found in clear cell renal cell carcinomas, high grade serous ovarian carcinomas, pancreatic adenocarcinomas and in endometroid endometrium carcinomas. In summary, TROP2 is abundantly expressed in a broad range of epithelial neoplasms. Both TROP2 upregulation and downregulation can be associated with cancer progression in a tumor type dependent manner. As anti-TROP2 cancer drugs have demonstrated efficiency and induce tolerable side effects they may be applicable to a broad range of tumor entities in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c2eec973-0ad6-4c5b-abdb-cec0c78d4815\/@A03B8ZF3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Molecular markers,Trop-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16321"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Dum<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Hube-Magg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald Simon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Bady<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Mandelkow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niclas C.

The Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway plays essential roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation, proliferation, and development. While targeting the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway has been validated as a very promising approach for CRC treatment, developing a therapeutic for inhibition of this elusive pathway has been very challenging for researchers. Of the seven chloro-naphthoquinone analogues, we found that two compounds, Compound <b>3<\/b> and Compound <b>6<\/b>, significantly inhibited Wnt target gene transcription and Wnt-induced colorectal tumorigenesis <i>in vitro<\/i>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation binding assays and computational modeling analysis revealed that Compound <b>3<\/b> and Compound <b>6<\/b> inhibit the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway through disruption of the TCF4-DNA binding, a crucial step for the activation of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway. Lastly, using a patient-derived organoid model and xenograft mouse model, we showed that these compounds inhibit CRC tumorigenesis. Taken together, this study demonstrates a novel mechanism of action for these chloro-naphthoquinone analogs, which can be further explored in future drug design and discovery efforts for small molecules targeting the TCF family proteins for inhibition of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b695f616-1967-4611-8eeb-0e4899093b32\/@A03B8ZF3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt pathway,Colorectal cancer,Small molecule inhibitor,DNA binding,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16322"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rosalie G.

However, the vast variation in treatment responses remains a major issue in the clinic. It is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying treatment failure in specific populations of patients. Genetic diversity has been recognized to mainly account for the differences in drug responses among patients. Yet, it is not feasible to map the responsible genetic variants within millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human genome in clinical settings with a limited number of subjects and insufficient genomic information. Genetically diverse mice are an ideal tool to overcome the limitations in clinical studies and model drug responses in hosts that require genetic susceptibility and resistance factors. Recent studies have also implicated a critical role for host cells (i.e., the tissue microenvironment) in building a protective &#8220;niche&#8221; for tumor cells enabling their escape from chemotherapeutic treatments. Notably, the host regenerative response upon chemotherapy &#8220;injury,&#8221; which is regarded as an intrinsic host mechanism to repair damaged tissues, may be exploited by tumor cells for their local recurrence or distant metastases. In this study, using a lung injury model, we determined how drug-induced lung stromal wound healing responses differed among eight inbred mouse strains (BALB\/cJ, NSG, C57BL\/6J, CH3\/HeJ, CBA\/J, SJL\/J, A\/J, and NOD\/ShiLtJ). Upon either cisplatin or doxorubicin stimulation, the wound healing-associated genes <i>Il-6<\/i>, <i>Spp1<\/i>, <i>Cxcl1,<\/i> and <i>Ccl2<\/i> were all found upregulated in lung stromal cells but showed a great variation across different strains. Furthermore, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on the lung stromal cells and immune cells isolated from three selected mouse strains (BALB\/cJ, C57BL\/6J, and NOD\/ShiLtJ) without and with doxorubicin treatment in vivo. The transcriptomic analyses revealed strain-specific and non-specific therapy-elicited gene signatures in different types of lung tissue cells. Collectively, our results signify an association between genetic backgrounds and drug-induced host responses in mice. The next steps of the study aim to understand how genetic diversity would functionally impact drug-induced lung tissue regeneration, lung inflammation, and post-therapy tumor relapse or metastasis in the lung.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2ba1e6a7-8049-43f1-8cb2-1d84caaf3b0e\/@A03B8ZF3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-04 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic polymorphism,Chemotherapy response,Mesenchymal,Lung metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16324"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carlos M.

ARFs belong to the RAS superfamily of small GTPases. ARF family proteins are activated by Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and inactivated by GTPase-Activating Proteins (GAPs). When active, they bind effectors, which mediate downstream functions. ARF6 localized on the plasma membrane plays a role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and endocytic recycling. Dysregulation of expression and\/or activity of ARF6 has been associated with enhanced cell migration, invasion, and proliferation in several types of cancer. Knockdown of ARF6 significantly inhibited the invasiveness of the cancer cells. There is a critical need for novel promising anticancer agents with lesser side effects and higher efficacy. Baicalein, extracted from the roots of the Chinese herb Huang Qin (<i>Scutellaria baicalensis<\/i>), showed a significant anticancer impact on many human cancers. However, the specific molecular mechanisms are still nebulous. Endometrial cancer cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of baicalein for 24 to 120 h. The effect on cell proliferation and invasion was determined utilizing MTS and Boyden chamber assays, respectively. The baicalein induced a dose and time-dependent reduction in cell viability. The invasiveness of cells was attenuated by baicalein. Furthermore, the anticancer effects were mediated by decreased ARF6, Rac1, and PAK1 expression in baicalein-treated cancer cells. In summary, the data reveal that suppression of ARF6 could reduce the invasive potential of endometrial cancer by modulating the major downstream effectors Rac1 and PAK1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2565f352-0e72-4cfd-9ce4-192c5c535fa7\/@A03B8ZF3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carcinogenesis,Natural products,Therapeutic target,Gynecological cancers: other,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16326"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Latoya Mcglorthan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Viqar Syed<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Previous pre-clinical study reported that E7130 had both cancer cell proliferation inhibitory activity and tumor microenvironment ameliorating activities featuring vascular remodeling effect and anti-CAF (cancer-associated fibroblasts) effect. Intratumoral hypoxia induces tumor malignancy and causes resistance against anti-cancer drugs including anti-estrogen agents (eg fulvestrant). It is hypothesized that vascular remodeling effect of E7130 mitigates hypoxia-induced resistant mechanism of ER (estrogen receptor) + breast cancer against anti-estrogen agents, resulting in improving anti-tumor activity of fulvestrant in combination with E7130.<br \/><b>Experimental procedure:<\/b> ER&#945; expression levels in human ER+ breast cancer cell lines under hypoxic or normoxic culture condition were examined by FCM (flow cytometry) analysis. The histological changes after treatment with E7130 were examined by immunohistochemical analyses in the MCF-7 subcutaneous xenograft model. Anti-tumor activity of E7130 in combination with fulvestrant were examined in concurrent and in sequential treatment in the MCF-7 model.<br \/><b>Summary: <\/b>In vitro hypoxic culture condition down-regulated ER&#945; expression in MCF-7 and T-47D compared with normoxic condition. E7130 had no effect on the ER&#945; expression level in the cancer cells in vitro. On the contrary, E7130 increased ER&#945; expression level in the cancer cells concomitantly with an increase of CD31-positive endothelial cell number (ie vascular remodeling effect) in MCF-7 xenograft tumor. These results suggested that E7130 up-regulated ER&#945; expression in cancer cells not by cell-autonomous manner but by mitigating intratumoral hypoxia via its vascular remodeling effect. Concurrent combination therapy of E7130 at 90 &#956;g\/kg with fulvestrant at 250 mg\/kg significantly inhibited the tumor growth compared with each monotherapy. In sequential combination therapy, pretreatment of E7130 followed by fulvestrant showed superior anti-tumor activity to posttreatment of E7130 following fulvestrant. Severe body weight loss was not observed in any treatment groups.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The vascular remodeling effect of E7130 increased ER&#945; expression in cancer cells in vivo, and sensitized ER+ breast cancer against fulvestrant to achieve promising combinational anti-tumor activity. Our data provides compelling evidence that E7130 attenuates tumor malignancy by its tumor microenvironment ameliorating effects and improves current anti-cancer therapy in combination with other drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2d56524f-7178-420c-baf3-69d53bc08dea\/@A03B8ZF3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-04 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Combination therapy,Hypoxia,Vascular permeability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16327"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Takanori Abe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Kawano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ken Ito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taro Semba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimiyo Tabata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroki Jozawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Osamu Asano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshito Kishi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Initial data showed an anti-mitotic effect on cancerous cells whilst more recent findings confirmed additional effects such as downregulation of DNA double strand break repair, replication stress, upregulation of autophagy, and immunogenic cell death. Identification of TTFields-driven alterations in pan-cancer and tumor specific pathway is needed to aid selection of therapeutic modalities to be applied concomitant with TTFields for improved treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify common pathways involved in the response to TTFields by comparing transcriptomics of various tumor type.<br \/>Methods: Control and TTFields-treated non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines and animal model, glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines and patient-derived cell lines, and a hepatocellular carcinoma animal model were examined. Samples from GBM patients treated with concomitant TTFields and temozolomide (TMZ) were compared to samples from patients treated with TMZ alone. A list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was generated from transcriptomics analysis. Enrichment analysis was conducted according to the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of MSigDB, Reactome, and Kegg pathway databases. Significantly overlapping pathways were identified using ActivePathways package according to the Reactome and Kegg gene sets, and an enrichment map was created according to the number of datasets supporting each pathway.<br \/>Results: DEGs in response to TTFields application included genes of the cytoskeleton, immune system, and some secretion proteins. Common pathways downregulated by TTFields (negative GSEA) included DNA repair, DNA and RNA synthesis, and cell cycle regulation, specifically the G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, and Myc targets. Common pathways upregulated by TTFields (positive GSEA) included the immune response, specifically complement cascades, coagulation, and lysosome activity. ActivePathways enrichment map results agreed with the gene set enrichment results, and revealed additional pathways involved in the response to TTFields, such as SUMOylation, metabolism of carbohydrates, unfolded protein response, and signaling by interleukins.<br \/>Conclusions: Transcriptomic analysis revealed common pathways involved in the responses to TTFields, regardless of the origin of the sample. Some identified pathways were in line with previously demonstrated effect of TTFields, such as mitotic interference, inhibition of DNA damage repair and upregulation of the innate immune response. New pathways revealed in this work support the examination of novel combination strategies with TTFields to increase the therapeutic effect in patients bearing various solid tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/89df31da-ea5d-4a6f-81f0-670dd8f58e1c\/@A03B8ZF3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Transcription,Bioinformatics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16328"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kerem Wainer-Katsir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gitit Lavy-Shahaf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiri Davidi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Jacobovitch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tali Voloshin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Itai Tzchori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yaara Porat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lianghao Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Story<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niv Pencovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilan Volovitz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua Branter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stuart J.

Historically, the occurrence of GBM is higher in male than in female of reproductive age. Usage of exogenous hormones are known to reduce the risk of glioma development and estrogen improves survival in a glioblastoma animal models, suggesting a potential protective role in GBM. Estrogen receptor &#946; (ER&#946;) may play a role as a tumor suppressor in GBM, and interestingly its expression decreases in higher-grade tumor samples with loss of differentiation. Therefore, a selective ER&#946; agonist could be a potential therapy against GBM. OSU-ERb-12 is brain penetrant, orally bioavailable ER&#946; agonist and demonstrates selectivity of ER&#946;: ER&#945; = 46:1. In this work, we have tested the efficacy of this drug in vitro against glioma cells and in an orthotopic, syngeneic, immune-intact GBM mouse model.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: We tested the efficacy of OSU-ERb-12, a novel selective ER&#946; agonist against commercial glioma cell lines and patient derived glioma stem like cells, cell proliferation rate via cell titer Glo assay. To evaluate the cell death Annexin-PI assay was performed using flow cytometry. We also tested impact of this drug on cell cycle distribution using flow cytometry-based assay. For <i>in vivo <\/i>studies, C57BL\/6 mice were intracranially implanted with the murine glioma cell line GL261-Luc2 and treated with 30 mg\/kg and 100 mg\/kg of OSU-ERb-12. Tumor growth was evaluated post implantation using bioluminescent IVIS imaging and animal survival (Kaplan-Meier) was recorded.<br \/>Results: Treatment with OSU-ERb-12 significantly reduced the cell proliferation rate of commercial cells and patient derived glioma stem cells from various molecular classifications with IC50= 5 &#181;M, 72h. Cells treated with OSU-ERb-12 showed a time and dose dependent enhancement in programmed cell death. Activation of ER&#946; did not lead to any significant change in cell cycle pattern. Although treatment with 30 mg\/kg OSU-ERb-12 did not show any change in survival (median survival 28 days) of tumor bearing mice, a significantly improved median survival was observed for mice dosed at 100 mg\/kg (median survival 45 days) in comparison to vehicle (median survival 28 days).<br \/>Conclusions: Our study demonstrates an important role of ER&#946; for glioma cell survival as observed by the potent biological effects of OSU-ERb-12 against glioma cell lines and immune intact murine glioma model that supports the potential for targeting the ER&#946; as a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bfbea248-9466-462b-b712-dd2bee63841e\/@A03B8ZF3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Estrogen receptor &#946;,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16329"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pratibha Sharma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayeeta Ghose<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Coss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chad Bennett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raju R.

GNAQ and GNA11 mutations, which are detected most of primary uveal melanoma, activate MAPK signaling pathway, increasing cancer cell proliferation, tumor progression and growth. BAP1 mutation is highly associated with liver metastasis and death. However, there are no good therapeutic compounds for uveal melanoma treatment in clinic. 3&#8217;-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) is an adenosine analog which inhibits growth of several types of cancer. However, its anticancer effects have been showed in limited cancer cell lines. In addition, action mechanism of 3&#8217;deoxyadenosin is poorly understood. In this study, we found different adenosine deaminase (ADA) expression or activity affects different anticancer results in uveal melanoma. Inhibition of ADA using either siRNA or pharmacologic approaches sensitized tumors to 3&#8217;-deoxyadenosine <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, resulting in increased apoptosis, reduced clonogenic capacity and slower migration of uveal melanoma cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. These potent ADA-dependent anti-tumor effects were also seen in various cancer cell lines. Therefore, we suggest the potential of adenosine deaminase (ADA) as both a biomarker predicting response to 3&#8217;-deoxyadenosine, and a target for combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ce1c559-b6c1-493e-ae63-13d9263e15b2\/@A03B8ZF3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Apoptosis,Adenosine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21146"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Su-Chan Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lujain Alaali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>HyukJean Kwon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammed Rigi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles G.
