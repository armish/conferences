[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) is an innate immunity receptor that triggers inflammation by recognizing double stranded RNAs. In the past decades, TLR3-agonists have been used to fight cancer as inducer of type-I interferons and inducer of apoptosis specifically in tumor cells but not in normal cells. No TLR3-agonist has reached the market to date due to lack of manufacturing reproducibility, specificity, activity and\/or due to toxicity. In this context, a new family of synthetic, specific and fully defined TLR3-agonist has been rationally designed (WO2019211492). Here we report the preclinical proof-of-concept of TL-532 in non-muscular invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In-vitro 2D and 3D cultures of J82 and RT4 NMIBC <i>versus<\/i> normal urothelial cells, were used. Freshly resected bladder tumors from patients were sliced and cultured <i>ex vivo<\/i> for 24 to 48h. <i>I<\/i><i>n vivo<\/i> experiments were performed using the ICI-resistant murine syngeneic\/ectopic bladder cancer model MBT2, treated by intra- and peri-tumoral injections of TL-532.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We demonstrated <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> that TL-532 induced tumor cell death specifically by apoptosis, while it was well tolerated by normal cells, representing a broad <i>in vitro<\/i> safety margin. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, this tumor cell death was associated with a tumor microenvironment switch, evidenced by increases in antitumor biomarker secretion (IFN-&#945;, IFN-&#955;1, IFN-&#947;, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CX3CL10), decreases in protumor biomarkers CCL22, sFAS and was associated <i>in vivo<\/i> with the recruitment and activation of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) at the tumor site. <i>In vivo<\/i> activity of TL-532 led to substantial tumor growth inhibition (88%) and delay (370%), translating in 35% complete response (CR) rate and 5.3-fold median survival benefit. Interestingly, among these CRs, 62% (13\/21) showed life-long tumor auto-vaccination after 3 consecutive rechallenges at 3, 10 and 30 months. Remarkably, 54% (6\/11) of the mice autovaccinated against bladder cancer also demonstrated cross-immunity against an unrelated and poorly immunogenic, syngeneic osteosarcoma cancer cell model (LM8). In addition, TL-532 treatment appeared to decrease the expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1 on tumor cells <i>ex-vivo<\/i> and in cDCs <i>in vivo<\/i> and demonstrated a remarkable ability to reverse the anti-PD-L1 tumor-resistance when combined with the ICI leading to doubling of CR rate.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We identified TL-532 as spearhead of a new rationally designed TLR3-agonist family. In monotherapy, it demonstrated substantial tolerance and promising anti-cancer and autovaccinal activity, which included unrelated cancers. TL-532 also demonstrated its remarkable ability to overcome ICI tumor-resistance, thus increasing the clinical landscape for ICI combination treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0fb868bc-449c-4615-a541-1fb838506d57\/@y03B8ZPx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Immunomodulation,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17119"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"e52bfd78-ba1c-469c-beb7-8c18b11107ac","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e52bfd78-ba1c-469c-beb7-8c18b11107ac\/@y03B8ZPx\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marc Bonnin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saïd Ourfali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathilde Boucard-Jourdin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clémence Perret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chloé Renoux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nelly Vey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Colombel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bettina Werlé<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sylvain Thierry<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Short term localized controlled immune activation has been shown to increase cytotoxic T cell infiltrate, resulting in reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival (Barrett et al. 2018). We have developed an encapsulated-mouse IL-12 formulation (mPCX12), using a sustained IL-12 release platform (Egilmez et al. 2000) to facilitate short term localized immune activation in the tumor without systemic toxicity. mPCX12 elicited a sustained dose-related IL-12 release concomitant with downstream IFN&#947; in mouse splenocytes, demonstrating mPCX12&#8217;s biologic activity. Similar results were observed with hPCX12 in human PBMCs. In an orthotopic murine glioma model, C57B6\/L mice were inoculated with 3 &#215; 10<sup>5<\/sup> GL-261 glioma cells in the frontal lobe via intracranial injection with drug treatment on Day 5. Mice were randomly assigned (n=22\/group) to receive a single intratumoral dose of mPCX12 at 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg, or mrIL-12 1&#181;g (equivalent to mPCX12 1mg), or empty shells or vehicle. In addition, lomustine (6 mg\/kg, QD&#215;5 i.p.) was also assessed. The results showed that mPCX12 treatment increased tumor IL-12 and downstream IFN&#947; levels in a dose dependent manner. At 1mg mPCX12, tumor IL-12 and IFN&#947; levels were 2069&#177;631 and 646&#177;8 pg\/mg, respectively, on Day 3. Low levels of IL-12 and IFN&#947; were observed in the systemic circulation of mPCX12 and mrIL-12 groups. mPCX12 tumor IL-12 level persisted, while mrIL-12 returned to baseline by Day 7. Flowcytometric immunophenotyping of tumors showed increased cytotoxic T cells in mPCX12 treated gliomas. These increases in local cytokine levels translated into a dose-related prolongation of survival compared to the median survival in the groups treated with vehicle and empty shells (~19 days), lomustine (20 days), and mrIL-12 (37 days). mPCX12 elicited a dose-related increase in survival. For mPCX12 at 1mg, the median survival was &#62;90 days. At Day 90, 41%, 45% and 55% of the animals that received doses of 0.5, 0.75 or 1mg mPCX12, respectively, were alive with median survival &#62;90 days (last day of study). At the end of the study, a portion of the surviving mice subgroups were euthanized, and those animals treated with mPCX12 were tumor free. The remaining surviving mPCX12-treated animals from the 0.75 mg and 1 mg mPCX12 groups were reinoculated with 3 &#215; 10<sup>5<\/sup> GL261 cells in the ipsilateral side of the brain and compared with age-matched control vehicle or empty shells. The median survival in control groups was 27 days, and all rechallenged mPCX12-treated groups survived at Day 90, demonstrating memory T cell activation.<br \/>In summary, short-term controlled release of locally administered IL-12 via PCX12 resulted in turning cold tumors hot, resulting in enhanced overall survival in an orthotopic GBM model. Thus, short term controlled locally administered PCX12 warrants further investigation in GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ef1326a-a9cf-49d2-a026-8ec0231d8810\/@z03B8ZPy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-12,Glioblastoma,Immuno-oncology,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17120"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sribalaji Lakshmikanthan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Damaris Diaz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prasad Kolli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arunthi Thiagalingam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul M.

Chemotherapeutic agents lead to cGAS - STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway activation that results in Type 1 IFN release (4). IFN receptor (IFNAR1, IFNAR2) signaling mimics viral immune responses, is associated with clinical benefit (5, 6) and is exploited by chemo-immunotherapies (7, 8). The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is associated with immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance (8). AXL serves as a critical regulatory checkpoint for TLR-induced IFN responses in dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells (9, 10). IFN receptor signaling induces AXL<i> <\/i>expression (11) and AXL activation on dendritic cells is targeted by viruses (e.g. Zika) to abrogate IFN responses and inhibit anti-viral immunity. AXL serves as an IFN-response checkpoint by blocking IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 signaling. We hypothesized that tumor cells exploit AXL signaling to abrogate Type 1 IFN responses and inhibit antitumor immunity. We evaluated whether AXL inhibition promotes Type 1 IFN signalling and enhances immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy.<br \/>AXL kinase inhibition (bemcentinib) in combination with chemotherapy (doxorubicin) increased IFN response gene expression in mammary carcinoma and melanoma cell lines. In vivo, bemcentinib treatment potentiated the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in combination with intratumoral doxorubicin injection (i.t) in the syngeneic myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC)- rich refractory mammary adenocarcinoma 4T1 model. In addition, bemcentinib treatment in conjunction with i.t. doxorubicin enhanced Type 1 IFN response, reduced cancer stemness and epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) gene expression in this model. Furthermore, this combination treatment regimen sensitized the immune checkpoint inhibitor refractory <i>Braf<\/i>-mutant melanoma (YUMM1.7) by enhancing the type 1 IFN response resulting in significantly improved median overall survival. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that bemcentinib potentiates chemo-immunotherapy by enhancing tumor Type 1 IFN response and dampening EMT.<br \/>References: 1) Galluzzi , Can Cell 2015. 2) Yan, Front Immunol 2018. 3) Fitzgerald, Nat Immun 2003. 4) Platanias, Nature Rev Immun 2005. 5) Sistigu, Nat Med. 2014. 6) Zitvogel L, Nature Rev Immun 2015. 7) Lazzari, Ther Adv Med Onc 2018. 8) Emens, CIR 2015. 9) Aguilera, Clin Can Res 2017. 10) Rothlin, Cell 2007. 11) Huang, Eur J Immunol 2015. 12) Cruz, JCI Insight. 2019.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4d568f35-ca6e-4abd-b56c-7e89277915b0\/@z03B8ZPy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,Interferons,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17122"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sushil Dhakal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sébastien Bougnaud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James B.

In ATLAS, patient-derived antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are pulsed with <i>E. coli<\/i> expressing individual mutations identified from the patient mutanome &#177; listeriolysin O, enabling interrogation of both CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell recognition. True neoantigens induce T cell activation and cytokine release, while Inhibigens lead to a downregulation of T cell responses and thus can promote tumor growth. Previous ATLAS screening of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from mice carrying B16F10 mouse melanoma tumors identified both neoantigens and Inhibigens. Upon therapeutic vaccination, adjuvanted neoantigens generated immunogenicity and anti-tumor efficacy<sup>1<\/sup>. In contrast, therapeutic vaccination with multiple ATLAS-identified Inhibigens, alone or in combination with an otherwise-protective vaccine, led to accelerated tumor growth, impaired T cell responses, and abrogated tumor immune infiltration.<br \/>Our current study further explores the mechanism of Inhibigen-specific responses through adoptive transfer of vaccine-experienced T cells into tumor-bearing recipient mice, as well as through analysis of T cell gene expression. Additionally, in order to determine whether Inhibigen identification and treatment translates into pro-tumor effects universally across tumor models, we performed ATLAS screening on CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells isolated from mice bearing orthotopic <i>KPC<\/i> pancreatic cancer. Out of 73 total non-synonymous mutations, we successfully identified 14 CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and 15 CD8<sup>+<\/sup> true neoantigens, and 16 CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and 18 CD8<sup>+<\/sup> Inhibigens. This is the first known comprehensive characterization of endogenous antigens in this model. Therapeutic administration of neoantigens as adjuvanted peptide vaccines in <i>KPC<\/i> tumor-bearing mice led to smaller tumor sizes and reduced ascites volumes, whereas Inhibigen vaccination accelerated tumor growth. Mouse studies are ongoing and additional data will be presented.<br \/>Taken together, our data from human cancer patients and two mouse cancer models support the importance of appropriate neoantigen selection and Inhibigen identification and exclusion from cancer therapies. Genocea&#8217;s GEN-011 neoantigen-targeted peripheral T cell (NPT) therapy candidate, designed using ATLAS-identified neoantigens and omitting Inhibigens, is being evaluated in an ongoing clinical trial (NCT04596033).

Via T helper (Th) 2 cytokine production, TSLP has been implicated in asthma, atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This range in which TSLP exerts its effects on inflammatory diseases makes the TSLP\/TSLPR axis an attractive therapeutic target. At Biocytogen, we generated a novel TSLP\/TSLPR double humanized mouse model that enables <i>in vivo <\/i>assessment of human anti-TSLP and anti-TSLPR antibodies. In our B-hTSLP\/hTSLPR mice, the murine <i>Tslp <\/i>and <i>Tslpr <\/i>genes are replaced with the human <i>TSLP<\/i> and <i>TSLPR <\/i>genes by homologous recombination. ELISA analysis showed that human TSLP (after induction with calcipotriol) was exclusively detectable in homozygous B-hTSLP\/hTSLPR mice compared to wild type mice. Similarly, flow cytometry analysis indicated TSLPR expression was detectable in monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, total DCs, cDC1, cDC2, Mo-DC and Pre-DC. Percentages of T cells, B cells, NK cells, DCs, granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and Tregs in homozygous B-hTSLP\/hTSLPR mice were comparable to those in the wild type mice, demonstrating that introduction of human TSLP and TSLPR in place of their mouse counterparts did not impair the overall development, differentiation, or distribution of these cell types. Furthermore, using an asthma mouse model via induction with ovalbumin (OVA), we showed that an anti-TSLP antibody (Tezepelumab, synthesized in house) was efficacious in controlling asthma progression in B-hTSLP\/hTSLPR mice. Altogether, B-hTSLP\/hTSLPR mice are a promising model for preclinical <i>in vivo <\/i>pharmacodynamic assessment of TSLP antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/61ca99c2-94b6-4540-9fca-1d9438696bdd\/@z03B8ZPy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Cytokines,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17124"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shujin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanhui Nie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiahui Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronika Chromikova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luke (Zhaoxue) Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mari Kuraguchi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This heterodimer complex is formed by the IL36 Receptor (<i>IL1RL2) <\/i>and IL-1R co-receptor accessory protein (<i>IL-1RAcP)<\/i>. IL36R is present on a diverse variety of cell types, including the surface of dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, and epithelial cells in various tissues. IL36 signaling can exert widespread inflammation, and its activity is implicated in several inflammatory diseases affecting epithelial tissues, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Thus, identification of novel therapeutics targeting this pathway are of significant clinical interest. To provide a preclinical platform for efficacy assessments of novel anti-human IL36R drugs, we generated a humanized hIL36R knock-in mouse model. In this model, a chimeric IL1RL2 coding sequence, which is composed of the human <i>IL1RL2<\/i> extracellular region and the mouse <i>Il1rl2<\/i> cytoplasmic region, was inserted after the 5&#8217;UTR of mouse <i>Il1rl2<\/i> gene using CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing technology. The mouse cytoplasmic region was maintained to ensure intact downstream signaling. Polymerase chain reaction assessment of mRNA isolated from the lung tissue of edited homozygous humanized IL36R mice confirmed the absence of mouse<i> Il1rl2<\/i> transcripts. Finally, to confirm the expression of human IL36R protein, immunohistochemistry was performed on the small intestine and skin tissue of humanized mice subjected to a chemical induction of psoriasis. Psoriasis-like symptoms were achieved by application of imiquimod cream on the back skin of the mice for 5 consecutive days. As expected, IL36R protein expression was detected in both tissues isolated from the homozygous humanized mice. These results indicate the successful generation of humanized IL36R mice, and suggest that this model will be an effective tool for future <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy evaluation of immunomodulatory drugs targeting human IL36R.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/805f582e-50ad-41de-b89a-99dde1d2e8e9\/@z03B8ZPy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Inflammation,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17125"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaofei Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiahui Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jenna Frame<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chong Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhifang Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuelei Shen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Macrophages play critical roles in tumor progression by controlling these events and are the focus of efforts to develop novel cancer therapeutics. We previously showed that PI(3)Kinase &#947;, a class Ib phosphatidyl inositol 3, 4, 5 kinase that is expressed primarily in myeloid lineage cells, controls tumor progression by serving as a critical switch between immune stimulation and suppression. PI3K&#947; also promotes angiogenesis, fibrosis and metastasis. PI3K&#947; signaling in macrophages promotes transcription of tumor-promoting cytokines and factors such as <i>Pdgf, Tgfb, Ccl2, Plau, Mmps<\/i> and <i>Arg-1<\/i> and inhibits expression of <i>Il12, Tnfa, Nos2<\/i> and other pro-inflammatory factors to stimulate tumor progression and immune evasion. Genetic or pharmaceutical inhibition of PI3K&#947; reverses these events and suppress tumor growth. In order to develop novel strategies to control macrophage contributions to cancer progression, we investigated in detail how this kinase controls gene expression. We found that PI3K&#947; deletion or inhibition with a selective inhibitor IPI-549, which is currently in late stage clinical development for cancer therapy, stimulates the expression and secretion of IL12, IL6, IL1&#946;, NOS, IFN&#945;, and TNF&#945;, while reducing the secretion and expression of IL10, CCL2, PDGF&#946;, ARG-1, TGF&#946; and other factors. Gene expression analysis indicates that PI3K&#947; inhibition in macrophages rapidly stimulates transcription of NF&#954;B and IFN&#947; driven pro-inflammatory pathways as well as nuclear translocation of transcription factors STAT1, IRF1, IRF3, TBK1 and NF&#954;B and inhibition of CEBP&#946; nuclear activity. To further understand the impact of PI3K&#947; on transcription in macrophages, we performed ATAC seq on WT and PI3K&#947; null macrophages stimulated with LPS\/IFN&#947; in order to determine the impact of PI3K&#947; activity and inhibition on chromatin accessibility. We found that PI3K&#947; deletion promoted more open chromatin sites for IRF, FRA I, Pu.1, and NF&#954;B binding, as well as fewer open chromatin sites for AP1 (FOS\/JUN), IRF8, and CEBP sites. Importantly, we identified overall chromatin accessibility in the promoters of some NF&#954;B regulated genes, such as <i>Tnf<\/i><i>&#945;<\/i> and <i>Il6<\/i>, as well as novel open chromatin sites in the promoters for<i> Il12b<\/i> and <i>Il1b<\/i> in PI3K&#947; null macrophages. We also identified novel closed chromatin sites in the promoters of <i>Il10<\/i>, <i>Plau<\/i> and <i>Ccl2<\/i>, genes that are downregulated upon PI3K&#947; inhibition. Further studies to identify the mechanisms by which PI3K&#947; regulates transcription are investigating PI3K&#947; controls of epigenetic modifiers and transcription factors are ongoing. These studies should lead to the identification of new approaches to regulate tumor associated macrophages to inhibit tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3499cf5b-7a89-4693-9477-3d994842e46f\/@z03B8ZPy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,Immunosuppression,Chromatin remodeling,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17126"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hui Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingwen Liao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Flores<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Hargreaves<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Varner<\/i><\/presenter>.

High doses of IL-2 are needed to activate CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Severe toxic side effects associated with high doses, as well as the poor PK profile of IL-2, have limited its clinical usage. Various strategies have been employed to prolong half-lives of IL-2 and enable selectivity or bias towards receptor binding to reduce toxicity and maintain good efficacy. Among these, certain PEGylation strategies have generated promising clinical results, but also showed some major limitations. We report a unique PEGylation strategy to produce PEGylated IL-2 with a therapeutic window more than two times larger than the reference PEGylated IL-2.<br \/>Methods: CT26 murine syngeneic model was used for evaluation of in vivo efficacy and safety. Each 6-8 weeks old female BALB\/c mouse was inoculated subcutaneously in the right front flank region with CT26 tumor cells (5 x 10<sup>5<\/sup>). Tumors were allowed to grow to mean size ~110 mm<sup>3<\/sup> before randomization and treatment. Body weights and tumor volumes were measured three times per week. The tumor-free mice at the end of the study were re-challenged with CT26 colon tumor cells on the left side.<br \/>Results: Utilizing our proprietary PEGylation technology, rhIL-2 was covalently connected with multiple PEG polymers through releasable linkers (RL). The releasable linkers are designed to modulate the release rate of the active IL-2 species. In CT26 syngeneic mouse model, CS-PEG-IL-2 showed significantly enhanced efficacy and safety over IL-2 and reference PEGylated IL-2. rhIL-2 (2 mg\/kg, bid x 5, two cycles, i.p.) resulted in complete response (CR) in one out of eight (1\/8) mice, while 3 mg\/kg dose resulted in death in 8\/8 mice. With the reference PEGylated IL-2, 3\/8 CR were obtained at 3 mg\/kg dose (q1w x 4, i.v.), and 6 mg\/kg dose resulted in death in 8\/8 mice. Whereas, with three CS PEGylated IL-2 analogs, 5\/8 and 6\/8 CR were achieved at 3 mg\/kg and 6 mg\/kg dose respectively, and no obvious toxicity was observed even at the highest dose. After re-challenged with another inoculation of CT26 cancer cells, the CR mice remained tumor-free until the end of the study at day 158.<br \/>Conclusions: CS unique PEGylation strategy generated PEG-IL-2 with superior anti-tumor efficacy and safety profiles.

We reasoned that concurrent activation of TLR9 and STING pathways could activate immunity with an efficacy and safety profile that could not be achieved by activating either pathway alone, and we designed a series of conjugates where TLR9 and STING agonists were linked together by a releasable or stable linker. The conjugates have been evaluated in in vitro assays and in vivo mouse models in comparison with TLR9 agonist or STING agonist alone and combination of the two agonists. <b>Methods: <\/b>Cellular potency was assessed using THP-1 monocyte cells and human PBMC. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in mouse tumor models<b>, <\/b>where tumor cells were inoculated into either the right flank or both flanks of C57BL\/6 or BALB\/c mice, test compounds were injected intratumorally into the right flank three times at every three days when tumors reached a volume of 90-100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, muDX400 was dosed via IP injection six times at every four days. In MC38 murine model, compounds-treated mice free from tumor for 30 days were re-challenged with MC38 tumor cells. <b>Results: <\/b> Conjugates CS-2554, 2571 and 2600 showed five to ten folds improvement in potency over the corresponding STING agonist alone or a mixture of the corresponding STING and TLR9 agonists (1\/1molar ratio) in THP1 assay, a similar fold of increase in EC50 was observed in human PBMC assay, where induction of IFN&#945;, IFN&#946;, TNF&#945; and IL6 were measured. In MC38 murine model, CS-2554 at the dose of 9 ug\/injection resulted in CR in all treated mice; whereas no CR was obtained when a mixture of an equivalent amount of the corresponding STING agonist and TLR9 agonist was used. The tumor-free mice remained tumor-free after re-challenge study. In MC38 dual tumor model, when combined with aPD-1, a mixture of 50 ug of TLR9 agonist and 5 ug of STING agonist resulted in CR in 38% treated mice, whereas the same level was achieved with only 4 ug of the corresponding conjugate CS-2571. Comparisons of a conjugate and either the corresponding agonist alone or the two in combination were also carried out in CT26 dual tumor model. On day 13, for the injected tumor, the tumor growth inhibition rate (TGI) of an equivalent amount of a TLR9 agonist, a STING agonist, a mixture of the two, and the corresponding conjugate CS-2600 was 29.65%, 31.3%, 61.00%, and 91.93%, respectively. For the distal tumor, only the conjugate CS-2600 showed significant inhibition of tumor growth with 57% TGI, whereas no tumor growth inhibition was observed with a TLR9 agonist, a STING agonist, or a mixture of the two. <b>Conclusions: <\/b>The conjugates harnessed significant synergy between TLR9 and STING pathways in vitro and in vivo and resulted in over ten times enhancement of potency in certain assays over either agent alone or a combination of the two.

Resistance to therapies, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), necessitates therapies that target this inflammatory TME. A major transcription factor that mediates chronic inflammation in KM-LUAD is signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Inhibiting STAT3 may attenuate pro-tumor inflammation. Moreover, STAT3 modulates PD-L1 transcription, so STAT3 inhibitors in conjunction with ICB may increase ICB response rates. Here, we tested the anti-tumor ability of TTI-101, a selective STAT3 inhibitor, in a STAT3 addicted lung cancer cell line (MDA-F471) and in a transgenic mouse model of KM-LUAD (CCSP<sup>Cre<\/sup>\/LSL-Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>, CC-LR). For <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments, CC-LR mice were treated daily with 50 mg\/kg TTI-101 by oral gavage from 10 to 14 weeks of age to model a preventative regimen or from 14 to 18 weeks of age to survey the treatment effect on established tumors. TTI-101 was compared to anti-PD-1 ICB, with 200 &#956;g injected intraperitoneally 3 times per week. In MDA-F471 cells, TTI-101 treatment decreased cell viability, with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ~ 20 &#956;M. In mice treated from 10 to 14 weeks of age, TTI-101 therapy significantly reduced the tumor burden compared to ICB. TTI-101 also reduced the number of proliferating cells within tumors. Mice in the 14-18-week group displayed similar trends, but these experiments are ongoing, as are combination TTI-101 and ICB treatment regimens. Our studies show that TTI-101 can reduce K-ras driven tumor cell proliferation <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>, suggesting STAT3 inhibition as an alternative preventive and therapeutic modality for KM-LUAD. The ongoing combination treatments and the 14-18-week cohorts will elucidate the timing of treatments as well as reveal if by targeting the inflammatory TME we are able to improve response to ICB.

Checkpoint blockade substantially improved survival in ~20% of recurrent and\/or metastatic HNSCC patients. However, given the lack of efficacy in most patients, and the known immunosuppressive nature of HNSCC, exploring other potential immune cell therapeutic targets is of interest. Decreased natural killer (NK) as well as increased immunosuppressive CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in both peripheral blood and the tumor microenvironment are associated with a poor prognosis in HNSCC. We discovered that the anti-diabetes drug, metformin, which is also known to improve immune cell function, not only increases peripheral NK cells in HNSCC patients to the level of healthy controls, but also suppresses IL-9 secretion from NK cells. IL-9 has been implicated as a driving factor in allergic disease, a poor prognosis factor in hematologic malignancies, and an enhancer of T-reg immunosuppressive abilities. However, the function of IL-9 in solid tumors is poorly understood. Interestingly, upon depletion of CD56+ NK and NKT cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), there was a significant increase of IL-9 secretion. This effect was negated upon depletion of CD4+ T cells suggesting that NK cells may directly or indirectly inhibit CD4+ T cell IL-9 production. In order to understand potential consequences of IL-9 overproduction, we subjected HNSCC cell lines, which we demonstrated express IL9 receptor, to exogenous IL-9 which resulted in enhanced proliferation. We also found that IL-9 plasma levels are high in HNSCC patients compared to healthy controls corroborating a potential tumorigenic role for IL-9. In order to elucidate potential mechanism(s) by which NK\/NKT cells regulate CD4+ T cell production, we performed single-cell RNAseq on PBMCs upon NK and NKT cell depletion. We also performed flow cytometry to identify specific CD4+ cell types responsible for increased IL-9 production and the consequential changes in other immune cell phenotypes upon the absence of NK\/NKT cells. Understanding the role of IL-9 in HNSCC will be important for utilizing IL-9 as a potential marker for HNSCC prognosis as well as a possible target for future immunotherapy approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1cd82125-32c1-44fc-889c-7014f1dc8a54\/@A03B8ZPz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Immunotherapy,T cell,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17131"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>McKenzie Crist<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Lehn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vinita Takiar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trisha Wise-Draper<\/i><\/presenter>.

The increase in our understanding of mechanisms regulating immune-mediated cancer eradication has led to the development of immune-based therapies which have revolutionized treatment of some previously lethal malignancies. T-cell activation requires proper intercellular interactions mediated by cytoskeletal rearrangements and adhesion molecules, along with intracellular signal transduction via phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases (Lck and Fyn). Abelson interactor-1 (ABI1) is an adaptor protein known to regulate actin polymerization, adhesion molecules and tyrosine kinases. Previously, ABI1 has been shown to localize to the immunological synapse in an antigen-dependent manner and has been linked to regulation of IL-2 secretion. Published data from our lab shows that ABI1 has high affinity binding to SH2 domains of Src family kinases, Fyn and Lck, both of which are essential in T-cell activation. Additionally, ABI1 has been linked to hyperactivation of SFKs\/STAT3\/NF-kB signaling. In this study, we aim to delineate the role of ABI1 in T-cell activation, differentiation and signaling.<br \/>Methods: We have generated a novel conditional knock-out mouse model to evaluate the effect of a T-cell specific <i>ABI1 <\/i>KO at the organismal level<i><\/i><i> <\/i>(<i><\/i><i>ABI1(fl\/fl)CD4Cre (ACD4<\/i>). T-cells isolated from control <i><\/i><i>(Abi1(fl\/fl)CD4Cre(-))<\/i> and ABI1 KO mice <i><\/i><i>(Abi1(fl\/fl)CD4Cre(+))<\/i> were used for <i><\/i><i>ex-vivo<\/i> analysis and further characterization of ABI1 KO cellular phenotype with: Flow Cytometry (CD3+ subpopulations in immune organs), Immunofluorescence (actin polymerization), Western blotting (TCR-mediated T-cell activation) and RNAseq (transcriptional reprogramming). Results: <i>In vitro <\/i>studies of ABI1 KO primary murine CD3+ T-cells showed increased levels of NF-kB and STAT3. Flow cytometry analysis of CD3+ T cells subpopulations showed a difference in the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; percentage of CD8+ T cells was increased, while percentage of CD4+ T cells was decreased in ABI1 KO vs. WT control mice. Furthermore, RNA seq analysis of CD8+ ABI1 KO T cells showed a significant decrease in the mRNA expression of <i><\/i><i>Thpok<\/i> (<i><\/i><i>Zbtb7b<\/i>) compared to WT.<br \/>Conclusion: Our preliminary studies show that ABI1 is a potential modulator of T-cell activation through regulation of Lck\/Fyn. This suggests ABI1 may play as a molecular switch negatively regulating T-cell activation by connecting phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction and actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Suggesting ABI1 as a new therapeutic to improve efficacy and longevity of T cell-based cancer immunotherapies. In addition, ABI1 appears to be implicated in the regulation of the percentage of CD4 and CD8 T-cells, a novel discovery which warrants further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/66827259-7b96-425f-81bc-c49f37ed5028\/@A03B8ZPz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Mouse models,Kinases,STAT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17132"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Altagracia Ortiz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andras Perl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcin Kortylewski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leszek Kotula<\/i><\/presenter>.

This has necessitated the development of a standardized approach to cell counting assays. In recent years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), has launched an effort to standardize cell counting methods to improve the confidence in cell counting measurements. There is a wide range of biological sample types, various formulations, and bioprocessing steps for cell and gene therapy products. Furthermore, there are no ground truth reference materials for live cells, making the determination of accuracy of cell counting difficult defined in the ICH Q2 (R1). Therefore, in order to increase the confidence of cell counting results, it is critical to follow the two recently published ISO cell counting standards to ensure cell counting methods are tailored to the specific sample and purpose.In this work, we will provide insights and guidance for the ISO standards for method selection. The important aspects of the ISO cell counting standards have been distilled to six key factors for selecting the cell counting methods. Attention to these details will allow researchers to more easily adhere to the ISO recommendations to ensure high quality cell counting measurements, and in doing so, sites can meticulously document their rationale, process, and data results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fa6b6b71-86e2-4fd2-92e0-f9ab37719cc7\/@A03B8ZPz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Assay development,Cancer immunotherapy,Cell proliferation,Cell counting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17133"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Leo Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Bell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Bo Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
