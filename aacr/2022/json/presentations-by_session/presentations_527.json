[{"Abstract":"Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. At present, ACE2 receptor is considered to be the key component in the SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmitting in the host. Among the cancer patients with COVID-19, the gastrointestinal cancer is the second most prevalent. The MethyLight and QASM assays were used to evaluated the genomic DNA 5mC methylation, while the CviAII enzyme-based 6mA-RE-qPCR was applied to determine motif-specific DNA 6mA methylation. The 6mA and 5mC methylation analyses of the long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (LINE1) were used to evaluate the global level of genomic 6mA and 5mC methylations, respectively. To investigate the role of ACE2 DNA methylation in regulating ACE2 expression, we performed a genome-wide methylation analysis in colorectal cancer samples collected at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The DNA 5mC methylation of ACE2 promoter in tumor tissues were significantly lower than that in normal tissues, while the DNA 6mA methylation of ACE2 promoter in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in normal tissues. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 in tumor tissues were lower than that in normal tissues. To explore the epigenetic regulation on ACE2 expression, we treated colon cancer cell lines with 5-Azacytidine and found ACE2 expression was upregulated after lowering the DNA 5mC methylation. The correlation analysis in patient cohort samples showed that ACE2 mRNA expression was positively correlated with DNA 5mC and negatively associated with DNA 6mA methylation. Next, a novel CRISPR-based tool was developed for sequence-specific 6mA editing on ACE2 promoter region, and it was applied in HCT116 cell to further confirm the regulatory role of DNA 6mA methylation in ACE2 mRNA expression. This tool was proved to be reliable with our findings that the CRISPR\/dCas9-METTL3 tool could dramatically upregulate DNA 6mA methylation in ACE2 promoter, while the global level of genomic 6mA methylation remained unchanged. Both the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 were significantly increased following a sequence-specific DNA 6mA editing in ACE2 promoter. In conclusion, we revealed the aberrant DNA 5mC and 6mA methylations in colorectal cancer, which upregulate ACE2 expression in colorectal cancer cells that may confer the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We developed a novel CRISPR-based tool that could realize site-directed 6mA methylation editing. Notably, the epigenetic regulation of DNA 6mA methylation on ACE2 expression provides an insight into the intersection of the biology of cancer, SARS-CoV-2 infection and organ-specific complication in COVID-19. Aberrant ACE2 methylation may serve as a biomarker and treatment target in these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5d125ede-28fa-447e-ad6d-a2c922ed3c19\/@A03B8ZQY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-12 Intersection of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,ACE2,SARS-CoV-2,6mA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17607"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Heng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yumo Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaopo Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meijin Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanxin Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Huichuan Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Febrile illness during COVID-19 is caused by cytokine release syndrome energized by innate inflammatory immune cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. Cancer has a worse clinical outcome with COVID-19 due to a potential contribution of the disordered inflammatory microenvironment and immune system. This study aimed to determine the impact of peripheral inflammatory responses on clinical outcome and severity of COVID-19 patients with and without cancer and compare their clinical spectra.<br \/><b>M<\/b><b>ethodology:<\/b> This IRB-approved, retrospective chart review performed at PNOC included patients 18 years or older with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from April 2020 to April 2021. Histopathology-confirmed cases identified excluded cranial metastases, pregnancy, or ICU-ineligible due to advanced malignancy or missing data. We collected the first clinical encounter data following a positive COVID-19 test, including CDC-defined COVID-19 symptoms, co-morbidities, cancer status, and treatment&#8212;clinical outcomes and death from any cause within30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. We determined peripheral blood inflammatory cells of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets and the ratios between lymphocytes and the other three. According to INH guidelines, we ranked clinical severity as presymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, or critical.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of 3745 people with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 65 (1.7%) had cancer. We randomly selected 130 non-cancer subjects, homogeneously distributed across each month. The median age was 59 years. Of all, 52.3% were women, 43% were diabetic, 45% were hypertensive, and 35% had the cardiopulmonary disease. Dyspnea occurs in 30.8% of those with cancer but in 59.2% of those without cancer (P &#60; .001). High neutrophil was significantly associated with severity (P = .038), but there was no significant difference between cancer and non-cancer groups. High lymphocytes, MPV, and Neutrophil \/Lymphocyte ratio were associated with symptoms but not outcome or severity. Death from any cause was more in the group with cancer 23.1% vs. 6.9%, P= .001. Only 2% of study participants with cancer continued chemotherapy after the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Mortality significantly remains higher when cancer is comorbid with COVID-19, as seen in international groups. Further studies are needed to confirm whether cancer immunomodulation is a factor. Peripheral inflammatory response modestly predicts a worse outcome, particularly with elevated neutrophils, known for its proinflammatory rule by polarization and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation with platelet activation. There was a modest increase in symptoms severity in non-cancer COVID19 but more mortality in cancer comorbid COVID-19","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e02657ab-9575-4d07-b7de-8292a1c78201\/@A03B8ZQY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-13 Risk factors and comorbidities resulting in adverse outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,COVID with Cancer ,Immune cells response,COVID Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17608"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amer N.

However, there are no effective oral drugs for the treatment of severe COVID 19 patients. We here discuss the mechanism of action for Proxalutaminde to treat mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 Patients.<br \/>Cellular entry and infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus are mediated by two key proteins in host cells, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host transmembrane protein, providing the binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 on the host cell surface, and transmembrane protease serine 2 protein (TMPRSS2), priming the S protein of SARS-Cov-2 to facilitate the viral entry into the host cells. Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins are regulated by androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Previously, Proxalutamide has been reported to downregulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cells derived from prostate, lung cancer and normal lung epithelial cells. In this study, we demonstrate that Proxalutamide inhibited the infection of SARS-COV-2 wild type, alpha and delta variants, with IC50s of 69, 48 and 39 nM, respectively. Moreover, Proxalutamide reduced SARS-COV-2 viral load in outpatients with COVID-19 (82% viral RT-PCR negative rate in active group vs. 31% in placebo group after treatment for 7 days (p-value&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Severe COVID-19 disease leads to cytokine storm resulting in pulmonary inflammation and extensive damage in lung and other organs. Anti-inflammatory drugs, including Baricitinib and dexamethasone, have shown limited clinical benefit for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Therefore, more effective drugs are in urgent need for patients suffering from severe COVID-19. Recently, Proxalutamide has been reported to reduce the mortality rate (HR=0.16) and lung injury (by 57%, active drug vs placebo groups) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in an IIT phase III study. We presented here the mechanism of action of Proxalutamide for targeting cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients. Proxalutamide was demonstrated to activate nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in macrophages, which stimulates the antioxidant response element (ARE) for reducing cytokine storm-induced organ damage in COVID-19. In addition, Proxalutamide inhibited TNF alpha and IL-6 expression and blocked INF gamma signaling by downregulating STAT1 expression in immune cells. Importantly, Proxalutamide reduced inflammatory cells in lungs in a Poly (I:C), pseudoviral induced-lung injury animal models. Further, Proxalutamide decreased C-reactive protein, D-Dimer and improved lymphocyte count, biomarkers for COVID-19 progression in clinical studies. Together, these results provide a strong rationale for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with Proxalutamide.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-01 Cancer drug repurposing to treat COVID-19,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Antigonist,Covid-19,MOA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18533"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liandong Ma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youzhi Tong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qianxiang Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongha Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaodan Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiha Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiangwei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huiyuan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weidong Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andy Goren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arul Chinnaiyan<\/i><\/presenter>.

We aimed to investigate the short-term impact of this COVID-related screening pause on patient participation and adherence to LCS.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We analyzed data of 5133 LDCT screening exams performed at our institution from 2961 patients who were aged 50-80 at each screen between July 31, 2013 and Dec 30, 2020. Independent t-test, Pearson&#8217;s chi-square and Fisher&#8217;s exact tests were used to compare monthly average number of LDCTs, on-time adherence rates (i.e., completion of recommended or more invasive follow-up within 15, 9, 5, and 3 months for Lung-RADS 1\/2, 3, 4A, and 4B\/4X, respectively), percentages of positive screens (Lung-RADS 3 and 4), and lung cancer diagnoses across pre- (July 31, 2013 ~ Mar 18, 2020), during (Mar 19, 2020 ~ May 19, 2020), and post-COVID screening pause (May 20, 2020 and after) periods.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> As expected, compared with the pre-COVID screening pause, there was a significant decrease in monthly average number of LDCTs during the COVID screening pause period (total monthly mean &#177; sd: pre 55&#177;28 vs during 17&#177;1, p&#60;0.05; new patient monthly mean &#177; sd: pre 34&#177;16 vs during 6&#177;2, p&#60;0.05). However, a surge in LCS activities was observed after the COVID screening pause period (total: during 17&#177;1 vs post 89&#177;10, p&#60;0.05; new: during 6&#177;2 vs post 42&#177;8, p&#60;0.05), surpassing monthly means in the pre-COVID period (total: pre 55&#177;28 vs post 89&#177;10, p&#60;0.05; new: pre 34&#177;16 vs post 42&#177;8, p&#60;0.05). Overall on-time adherence decreased in the post-COVID period as opposed to the pre-COVID period (p&#60;0.05). There were no significant changes in the percent of positive screens across the three periods (p&#62;0.05). Among the 88 patients diagnosed with lung cancers, 76 diagnoses were made before COVID, 12 diagnoses were made after the COVID pause, and no lung cancer diagnoses were made during the COVID screening pause period. There were no significant differences in terms of the rate of lung cancer (pre 2.9% vs post 1.9%, p&#62;0.05) and the percent of advanced lung cancers (pre 20% vs post 0%, p&#62;0.05) during the two periods.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The rate of LCS exams performed at our institution declined during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, as elective exams were paused.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer for women in Ireland, and the impact of the pandemic on BC care needs to be established. The purpose of this study is to explore the health care experience of women with BC during the pandemic and to investigate whether these experiences vary based on social determinants of health (SDH).<br \/>The study included semi-structured qualitative interviews with 37 women who had previously participated in a related quantitative study. Individuals were selected through stratified purposive sampling to ensure data was available on information-rich cases based on SDH. Interviews were conducted in early 2021 and thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software.<br \/>Three major themes, with additional subthemes, emerged from analysis: <i>breast cancer services; breast cancer support and communication; and mental well-being<\/i><i>.<\/i> There were differences in women&#8217;s experiences within the themes that were dependent upon the SDH, including socio-economic status (SES), region, and time since diagnosis. For example, most women experienced disrupted BC services throughout the pandemic, but disruptions were more severe for women of lower SES. Table 1 provides quotation examples as evidence for these different experiences.<br \/>The pandemic has impacted women with BC considerably, but the impact differed by social inequalities and time of diagnosis. This study highlights areas for improvement in the context of BC care in Ireland and the findings will inform further policy and practice.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{C4318C54-1416-4AA2-8965-F76C56FD6003}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><u>Diagnostic\/ screening services<\/u><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><u>Active t<\/u><\/b><b><u>reatment<\/u><\/b><b><u> services<\/u><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><u>Post<\/u><\/b><b><u>-<\/u><\/b><b><u>treatment<\/u><\/b><b><u> services <\/u><\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><u>General experiences<\/u><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>&#8220;I felt a lump&#8230; so I went to my own GP.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) precede MM and affect ~5% of individuals age &#62;=50. We previously showed that individuals with MGUS and SMM exhibit immune dysregulation. Here, we investigate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in these asymptomatic but potentially immunocompromised individuals.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The IMPACT study (IRB #20-332) is a prospective study at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in collaboration with MMRF, which enrolled individuals nationwide with a diagnosed plasma cell dyscrasia and healthy individuals. As of October 2021, 3,005 individuals completed a questionnaire regarding prior infection or vaccination. We obtained 1,350 blood samples from 628 participants and analyzed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer by ELISA.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>2,771 (92%) participants were fully vaccinated (2 doses BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273; 1 dose Ad26.COV2.s), 269 (9%) had received a 3<sup>rd<\/sup> mRNA vaccine dose, and 234 (8%) were unvaccinated. 1,387 (46%) and 1,093 (36%) participants received mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273), and 139 (5%) participants received an adenovirus vector vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S). 34 (1%) individuals reported SARS-CoV-2 infection after full vaccination.<br \/>We measured antibody titers in 201 MGUS, 223 SMM, 40 smoldering Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (SWM), 64 MM, and 100 healthy controls. Multiple linear regression model estimated the association between various clinical variables and post-vaccination antibody titers. As previously reported, having MM was associated with low antibody titer (p &#60; 0.001). Of note, having SMM, regardless of risk stratification by 2\/20\/20 criteria, was also associated with low antibody titers, indicating that even low-risk SMM patients have a poor response to vaccination. MGUS and SWM diagnoses were not significantly associated with antibody titers. Additionally, male sex (p &#60; 0.010), elapsed time after vaccination (p &#60; 0.001), and BNT162b2 vaccine (p &#60; 0.001) were associated with low antibody titers. SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination was associated with high antibody titers.<br \/>We identified 25 patients (6 MGUS, 10 SMM, 2 SWM, 7 MM) who submitted blood samples after both the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> and 3<sup>rd<\/sup> dose. In these patients we observed a significant increase in antibody titer after a 3<sup>rd<\/sup> dose (p = 0.002). We also observed that antibody titers of patients after a 3<sup>rd<\/sup> dose (13 MGUS, 12 SMM, 2 SWM, 31 MM) were comparable to that of healthy individuals after a 2<sup>nd<\/sup> dose (p = 0.833).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our data indicates that suboptimal response to SARS-CoV-2 does not only occur with MM and cancer patients receiving therapy but also in precursor asymptomatic patients including low-risk SMM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/de942024-2646-44b1-b930-d3cd046a0848\/@B03B8ZQZ\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-06 COVID-19 vaccines and immune responses among cancer patients,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Precursor stages of myeloma,Vaccines,Risk factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18536"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yoshinobu Konishi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Romanos Sklavenitis-Pistofidis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Yue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federico Ferrari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massimiliano Russo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert A.

Cancer pathways are not designed for M&#257;ori health gain and are not pandemic resilient. M&#257;ori receive delayed poorer quality treatment and those with comorbidities are undertreated [1]. Existing inequities from time of referral to cancer services through to treatment were exacerbated by the COVID-19 response in Aotearoa NZ. Coordination of care is crucial for M&#257;ori patients and wh&#257;nau (family), but poorly developed along this early part of the cancer pathway. In addition, care quality is not well monitored, and the current pathway is vulnerable to changes created by pandemic conditions.<br \/><b>Aims:<\/b><b><\/b> This study seeks to co-design, implement and evaluate a holistic cultural and clinical cancer service that is patient and wh&#257;nau centred; the Wh&#257;nau Hauora Integrated Response Initiative (WHIRI) programme. This comprehensive, pandemic resilient, racism-free, hauora (wellbeing) enhancing and responsive model of care will be designed for the early part of the secondary care cancer pathway.<br \/><b>Design and Method:<\/b><b> <\/b> The WHIRI programme includes navigation, a holistic wh&#257;nau\/family hauora assessment tool, proactive management by a team of clinicians and a team responsible for making systems changes. WHIRI was launched mid-pandemic (early 2020) for kaum&#257;tua (elderly M&#257;ori) with long-term conditions and ran for 3 months. During COVID we found that WHIRI had the potential to change hospital systems and improve experiences for patients and wh&#257;nau. WHIRI ensures the provision of best-practice timely treatment for M&#257;ori patients and could make large gains in closing the survival gap between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori in the short- to medium-term, leading to reductions in M&#257;ori cancer deaths. We plan to redesign WHIRI into a cancer programme that functions effectively in all COVID levels using qualitative Kaupapa M&#257;ori methodology. Key to this methodology is partnerships with patients, wh&#257;nau, cancer clinicians, M&#257;ori navigators and The Cancer Control Agency New Zealand. We will present our methods and co-design model of cancer care. We will outline the potential to expand the model nationally with reach from primary care all the way through to palliative care. It will also provide a platform for future research to measure the impact of WHIRI on cancer and wh&#257;nau care. <i>1. Hill S, Sarfati D, Blakely T, Robson B, Purdie G, Chen J, et al.
