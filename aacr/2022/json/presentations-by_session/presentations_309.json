[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and metastases-related death is the main cause of its high mortality. Circulating\/disseminated tumor cells (CTCs\/DTCc) are considered as precursors of distant metastatic spread and can act as an independent prognostic biomarker. The impact of CTCs\/DTCs presence in perioperative period on long-term cancer specific survival (CSS) was assessed.<br \/><b>Patients and methods:<\/b> The presence of CTCs\/DTCs in peripheral blood, tumor-draining blood, and bone marrow of 188 colorectal cancer patients was analyzed before, immediately after, and one month after surgery using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) mRNA-positive CTCs. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 03337347), patients were followed-up and the cause of death was determined.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Over a median follow-up period of 116.5 months, 81 of 148 (54.7%) stage I-III CRC patients died. In total, 40.7% of them (33\/81) died of cancer. The presence of CTCs\/DTCs did not correlate with any conventional clinical or pathological features (tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, grade, KRAS mutations or microsatellite instability). Patients with CTCs\/DTCs in the peripheral blood and bone marrow one month after surgery had significantly shorter CSS (p=0.013, HR=2.6; resp. p=0.019, HR=2.3) than those without CTCs\/DTCs. Shorter overall survival was also observed in patients with tumor-draining blood CEA mRNA-positive CTCs before surgery (p=0.014).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The presence of CK20 mRNA-positive CTCs\/DTCs in blood and bone marrow after surgery was confirmed as an independent negative prognostic factor for the long-term cancer-specific survival in stage I-III colorectal cancer patients.The study was supported by Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic (NV18-03-00470), Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic (LM2018132; LM2018133), Palacky University Olomouc (LF 2021_019) and European Regional Development Fund (ENOCH CZ.02.1.01\/0.0\/0.0\/16_019\/0000868, ACGT CZ.02.1.01\/0.0\/0.0\/16_026\/0008448).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8521baed-143d-4f5c-ae8f-9cbaddc4bef2\/@A03B8ZBa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Colorectal cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12576"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Josef Srovnal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pavel Skalicky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alona Rehulkova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kamil Vyslouzil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monika Vidlarova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jana Vrbkova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marian Hajduch<\/i><\/presenter>.

ESR1 mutations are a major mechanism of acquired endocrine resistance in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We previously reported that ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was associated with worse prognosis in MBC (2020 ASCO). Herein, we report a new ultra-high sensitivity approach of ESR1 mutations assay for single CTC by using DEPArray system and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR).<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods<\/b><b>:<\/b> Whole blood sample (7.5ml\/each) was collected from stage IV MBC patients and then CTC enumeration was performed in CellSearch&#8482; System by targeting the EpCAM antigen (2020 AACR #3120). The single CTC and single white blood cell (WBC) were then isolated from CellSearch cartridges by using DEPArray<sup>TM<\/sup> System (Menarini). The single CTC DNA was isolated by QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen). ESR1 mutations hotspots including p.E380Q, p.Y537S and p.D538G were analyzed by using QX200<sup>&#8482;<\/sup> ddPCR System (Annealing\/Extension=58 &#176;C, 40 cycles) and the corresponding probes (Mutation-FAM and Wild type-HEX mixed) for p.E380Q-dHsaMDS500014536, p.Y537-dHsaMDS975379796, p.D538G- dHsaMDS460485301 respectively (Bio-Rad). Meanwhile, corresponding plasma ctDNA was analyzed by Guardant 360 Health NGS-based assay for a 73 genes panel for single nucleotide variants.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Positive controls (using 0.00000325ng pure positive DNA) and negative control (using water) were performed in each ddPCR assay. In cohort 1:<b> <\/b>total of 8 samples including 4 single CTC samples and 4 single WBC samples were collected using the DEPArray system. Wild type ESR1 (p.E380Q, p.Y537S and p.D538G) was detected in all 4 single CTC samples and 4 single WBC samples. There were 3 copies, 3.4 copies, 1.6 copies and 1.8 copies of p.E380Q mutation droplets found in 4 single CTC samples when there were no p.Y537S or p.D538G mutations found in these samples. There was no ESR1 mutation found in the corresponding ctDNA. In cohort 2: Two samples including 4 CTCs and 100 CTCs were collected from CellSearch cartridges. There were 0.09 vs 1 copies (8.25%) and 0.1 vs 0.31 copies (24.39%) of p.E380Q mutation droplets found in these two samples respectively, compared to ctDNA results of 1.80% and 0 respectively. Furthermore, there was 0.08 vs 0.67 copies (10.66%) of p.D538G mutation droplets were found in the sample including 100 CTCs compared to 12.70% mutations detected in the corresponding ctDNA.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our new approach verified the feasibility of ESR1 mutations assay in very low amount DNA from single CTCs with high sensitivity even when ESR1 mutation could be found in CTCs but not ctDNA. This approach may offer a strong evidence for early disease metastasis, efficacy of individualized treatment monitoring and personalizing cancer therapy for precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Breast cancer,Single cell,Estrogen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12577"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qiang Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo D'Amico<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marwa Manai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolina Reduzzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew A.

However, their therapeutic exploitation is disappointing. CTC-derived eXplants (CDX) offer systems for mechanistic investigation of CTC metastatic potency and biology-driven therapeutic testings. We perform in-depth molecular and functional characterization of CDX models and demonstrate that targeting defects in the DNA damage response (DDR) and genome integrity regulators impedes CTC-driven metastasis in NSCLC.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods: <\/b>CTCs were enriched from 30 mL blood samples of 56 advanced NSCLC patients and implanted subcutaneously into Nod\/Scid-IL2R&#947;-\/- (NSG) mice. Tumors were palpable within a median of 108 days. Among the four CDX models established, three CDX-derived cell lines (GR-CDXL1, GR-CDXL3, GR-CDXL4) were obtained. CDX and cell lines were characterized by immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry and whole-exome sequencing (WES). Chromosomal instability (CIN) and DDR activity were evaluated by IF and western blot. Gene expression was quantified by qRT-PCR. Tumorigenic potential of CDX-derived cell lines was assessed in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane and NSG mice engrafted intravenously. IC<sub>50 <\/sub>was assessed using CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#174;<\/sup>.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Four CDX models and three CDX-derived cell lines were established from NSCLC CTCs and recapitulated patient tumor histology (available for three patients) and response to platinum-based chemotherapy. WES analysis showed considerable mutational landscape similarity between the CDX (GR-CDXL1, GR-CDXL2, GR-CDXL3, GR-CDXL4), corresponding patient tumor biopsy and\/or single CTCs. Truncal alterations in key DDR and genome integrity-related genes were prevalent across models and assessed as therapeutic targets <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>in ovo <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. GR-CDXL1 presented homologous recombination deficiency linked to bi-allelic <i>BRCA2 <\/i>mutation, <i>FANCA <\/i>deletion and unrepaired DNA lesions post-mitosis. GR-CDXL1 cells were sensitive to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib, despite chemoresistance, which challenges the current clinical hypothesis claiming that chemosensitive NSCLC patients should respond to PARPi. Targeting CIN through centrosome clustering inhibition in GR-CDXL3 impeded tumor growth <i>in ovo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In GR-CDXL4, olaparib sensitivity was dictated by SLFN11 overexpression, which also correlated with increased neuroendocrine marker expression at patient disease progression, suggesting a predictive value of SLFN11 in histological transformation of NSCLC into SCLC.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study unravels distinct DDR profiles as a central mechanism underpinning CTC metastatic potency.

This information can be helpful in prognosis, treatment selection, and stratification of cancer patients. AccuCyte&#174; is a density-based unbiased isolation method that transfers nucleated cells from whole blood to slides for the characterization of CTCs and other rare cells. RarePlex&#174; panel kits are IF staining reagents used on automated slide staining instruments to label cells to differentiate CTCs from white blood cells (WBC). CyteFinder&#174; is a seven-channel automated fluorescent imaging system that rapidly scans microscope slides and applies machine learning algorithms to identify CTCs. Together, these technologies provide an end-to-end solution for CTC characterization. For analysis, blood is drawn into AccuCyte blood collection tubes (BCTs) containing a preservative which maintains cell properties prior to processing onto slides. Once slides are prepared, they can be stored at -20&#176;C without significant biomarker degradation. This flexible workflow allows investigators to bank samples for batch analysis and to begin sample collection prior to validating the IF assay to be used. This study was designed to evaluate: (1) stability time between collection in the AccuCyte BCT and sample processing; (2) performance of an improved version of the AccuCyte kit with higher nucleated cell isolation capacity; and (3) storage time that AccuCyte prepared slides can be banked frozen prior to staining. The study was performed using model CTCs and cancer patient samples. Metrics to determine performance were CTC recovery and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of biomarker expression. Our results demonstrate that the AccuCyte BCT preserves blood components for at least 5 days after collection without significant effect on CTC recovery or biomarker expression. The latest version of the AccuCyte kit demonstrated a higher cell isolation capacity and could collect up to 60% more nucleated blood cells than the previous version, increasing CTC recovery. The increased capacity was demonstrated in patients treated with hematopoietic growth factors, whose WBC count was significantly higher than the normal range. Finally, accelerated-aging study results demonstrated that AccuCyte-prepared slides can be stored at -20&#176;C for at least 4 years without significant effect on most biomarkers tested. In conclusion, enhancements to the AccuCyte-CyteFinder platform reported here increase flexibility and performance for analysis of CTCs in global clinical trials by allowing longer periods of time before collected blood samples need to be processed and by extending the length of time processed slides can be banked before they are stained.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63664450-226d-4766-8043-14b26337393b\/@A03B8ZBa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Liquid biopsies,Diagnostic marker,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12579"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"2ade0f01-3f4b-4ad3-9652-a5c7e8c5d2da","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2ade0f01-3f4b-4ad3-9652-a5c7e8c5d2da\/@A03B8ZBa\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arturo B.

CRC is marked by its extensive solid tumor heterogeneity and the difficulties in longitudinally monitoring a patient&#8217;s disease status. Being a minimally invasive prognostic tool, the liquid biopsy has immense potential to improve current clinical practice by providing real-time personalized information over the course of treatment. Utilizing the High-Definition Single Cell Assay (HDSCA) workflow, we employed a &#8220;no cell left behind approach&#8221; to analyze peripheral blood samples from metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients at various timepoints during treatment. We highlight the circulating rare cell population present in the liquid biopsy of mCRC patients, showing the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of CTCs. We observed a significant association between CTC subcategorization based on morphological differences and survival, emphasizing the heterogeneity within the CTC classification. Moreover, considering the time of sample collection in relation to the clinical scenario is critical in determining the prognostic relevance of static cellular enumerations as well as the change in cell populations over time. Through the integration of cellular morphology in a time-based analysis, the liquid biopsy can provide insight into the pathophysiology of mCRC by highlighting the complexity of the disease to monitor treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/88f03d06-aab7-4dc7-8464-f8749c9f4220\/@A03B8ZBa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Colorectal cancer,Heterogeneity,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12581"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sachin Narayan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, rates of intrinsic alpelisib resistance are as high as 40%, and there is an ongoing need for novel biomarkers to help guide patient selection. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may better reflect the heterogeneity of metastatic disease than tissue biopsy, and are amenable to longitudinal analysis. By combining targeted ctDNA sequencing with CTC transcriptional profiling and quantitation of PI3K pathway phospho-proteins, we have developed the first multiplex assay to simultaneously assess genomic alterations and CTC PI3K pathway activity via liquid biopsy.<br \/>Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from MBC patients with known PIK3CA mutation status serially prior to starting new standard therapies and on treatment. Cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma and sequenced using a custom capture panel (IDT). CTCs were isolated with VERSA microfluidic technology integrating capture with downstream analysis. CTCs were captured immunomagnetically followed by RNA isolation on chip and RNA-seq, or staining on chip for phospho-AKT pS473 and total AKT or phospho-rpS6 pS235\/S236 and total rpS6, followed by quantification of single cell phospho\/total protein mean fluorescence ratios.<br \/>Results: In a pilot cohort of 14 patients, mean CTC phospho-AKT\/total AKT protein expression ratio was higher in patients with PIK3CA mutations compared to patients without mutations (0.37 vs 0.26, p&#60;0.01). A transcriptional signature of PI3K activity was also higher in CTCs from patients with PIK3CA mutations than from patients without. Among patients with PIK3CA mutations, there was inter-patient heterogeneity in CTC phospho-AKT and phospho-rpS6, consistent with variability in pathway activation. One patient with a tissue PIK3CA mutation 5 years prior did not have the mutation detected in ctDNA at time of liquid biopsy, and had low phospho-AKT and transcriptional PI3K activity in CTCs. In serial sampling of a patient receiving a PI3K inhibitor, CTC phospho-AKT was decreased on treatment, and increased at time of progression.<br \/>Conclusion: We have demonstrated the feasibility of a comprehensive liquid biopsy for simultaneous monitoring of PI3K pathway mutations in ctDNA and PI3K pathway signaling in CTCs via transcriptional profiling and phospho-protein expression in patients with MBC. Future work will prospectively evaluate this assay in patients receiving alpelisib for PIK3CA-mutated MBC. This has the potential to complement PIK3CA mutation status as a biomarker of sensitivity to PI3K therapies, and may also provide a pharmacodynamic assessment of PI3K inhibitor activity in CTCs on treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2d6f4e6b-ad3d-441c-b7ae-6599a041a305\/@A03B8ZBa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Breast cancer,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12582"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marina N.

Previous studies showed the poorer survival in colorectal cancer patients treated perioperatively with morphine in comparison to piritramide.

The CTCs were identified using the CytoTrack CT11<sup>TM<\/sup> (2\/C, Denmark), a semi-automated immunofluorescence microscopy detecting the pan-cytokeratin and EpCAM signals. The method recovery rate was analyzed using SW-480 cancer cell line by flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results <\/b> The CTCs were found most frequent in the samples obtained at first day after surgery (44,9 %) followed by the samples collected before surgery (36 %).

The importance of distinguishing phenotypic states of CTC in addition to genomic alterations has been addressed for identifying predictive biomarkers and understanding CTC biology. Current liquid biopsy usually relies on only one phenotypic state of CTCs without further genomic validation of cancer cell identity. Here, we developed HDSCA3.0, a multi-omic platform, which could distinguish various phenotypic states of CTCs followed by genomic characterization.<br \/>Methods:<i> <\/i>Paired peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow aspirate (BMA) samples were collected prospectively from 80 metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients for retrospective analysis. Seventy-nine of them were part of <i>Cabazitaxel With or Without Carboplatin<\/i> Trial (NCT01505868) and one independent index patient was included with aggressive disease and unfavorable prognosis. CTCs were detected, classified, enumerated through a four-channel immunostaining assay (DAPI|Cytokeratin|Vimentin|CD45\/CD31) and a computational pipeline followed by manual curation, and subjected to single-cell copy-number profiling for clonality analysis and aggressive variant prostate cancer molecular signature (AVPC-MS) detection i.e. 2+ defects in <i>PTEN, RB1, <\/i>and<i> TP53 <\/i>genes.<br \/>Results:<i> <\/i>CTC subtypes were categorized from Cytokeratin-positive rare cell groups based on the presence of mesenchymal features and platelet attachment. Of 79 trial cases, 77 (97.5%) had CTCs, 24 (30.4%) were positive for platelet-coated CTCs (pc.CTCs) and 25 (38.5%) of 65 sequenced patients exhibited AVPC-MS in CTCs. Survival analysis indicated that the presence of pc.CTCs identified the subset of patients who were AVPC-MS-positive with the worst prognosis. In AVPC-MS-negative patients, its presence showed significant survival improvement from combination therapy. In index patient, we uniquely identified genetically clonal mesenchymal-like CTCs (mes.CTCs) and their presence was significantly associated with one subclone emerged along clonal lineage. Meanwhile, differences of CTC abundance and phenotypic diversity were observed between paired PB and BMA as well as genomic variations.<br \/>Conclusion:<i> <\/i>Our findings suggest pc.CTCs and AVPC-MS in CTCs as a multi-omic predictive biomarker to stratify mCRPC subpopulations with the worst prognosis and the most significant benefit of additional platinum therapy and illustrate a robust approach to analyze intra-patient CTC genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity and association.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Phenotypic & Genotypic Heterogeneity,Predictive Biomarkers,Single-cell Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12584"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shoujie Chai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Matsumoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Storgard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chen-Ching Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Aparicio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Ormseth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kate Rappard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunningham Kate<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anand Kolatkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rafael Nevarez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Han Tu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ching-Ju Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amin Naghdloo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paymaneh Malihi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liya Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Corn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amado Zurita-Saavedra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Hicks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Ruiz-Velasco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Kuhn<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the routine measurement of CTC in clinical practice is still very uncommon and some key features of CTC in clinical samples are only being discovered. One of these features that we have identified by supporting CTC clinical research for over 10 years, is the presence of two distinct patient populations: one with high levels of CTC &#62;220\/7.5mL blood and one with levels of CTC &#60;160\/7.5mL. The clinical significance of this observation is still unknown, but based on this report, we propose a new oncology phenomenon: CTC Surge. Methods: In the past ten years we worked on more than half dozen clinical study projects by using CellSearch Systems by Menarini Silicon Biosystems (formerly Veridex), the only CTC technology platform approved by FDA. The Cell Search system detects CTCs by staining with surface markers coated on nanoparticle beads. The detection of CTC is linear over the reportable range of 0 to 1238 tumor cells. The FDA-approved clinical significant cut-off lines are 5 CTCs for prostate and breast cancers, and 3 for colorectal cancer. Results: All CTC results are sorted by count from low to high. There are two distinct groups roughly above 220 and below 160 per 7.5 mL of peripheral blood. The significance of a CTC enumeration &#62; 220 is that there are as many as 150,000 tumor cells in circulation at the moment of sample collection. This may be the reason why some patients&#8217; condition suddenly worsens when there is an overwhelming presence of CTCs in the bloodstream. The CTC test is a great tool for clinicians and scientists to monitor cancer diseases progression. Unlike a low number of CTCs that may actively engage in intravasation through a set of genes, the mechanism of CTC Surge likely has a completely different set of driving forces, such as internal wound, tumor necrosis and open access to blood vessels inside or surround the tumor mass. Although we do not yet know the clinical significance of our observation, the CTC test offers a simple tool to monitor the rapidly changing tumor dynamics seen in CTC Surge.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1a8c4694-1dac-41b4-987b-1e0e74ed61a5\/@A03B8ZBa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Metastasis,Biomarkers,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12585"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chengsen Xue<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy K.

Patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) often have less than one genome equivalent of ctDNA per 10 mL blood. Consequently, it is stochastic whether a 10 mL sample contains ctDNA from a particular genomic locus. Consequently, the sensitivity of ctDNA detection methods targeting a limited number of tumor loci is heavily affected by sampling bias. To overcome this challenge, we developed MRDetect; a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach, which detects ctDNA using the patient-specific cumulative signal from tens of thousands of mutations throughout the genome. Recently, we showed how MRDetect found ctDNA fractions down to 10<sup>-4<\/sup>. Here, we performed a validation study to confirm the prognostic impact of MRDetect.<br \/><b>Aim: <\/b>Validation of MRDetect for sensitive ctDNA detection to monitor residual disease in stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients treated with curative intent.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>From a large, uniform cohort of stage III CRC patients n = 146), we had plasma samples collected every third month (n = 938, median = 9 per patient) and a median follow-up of 34 months. For each patient, a genome-wide mutational signature was established by WGS of tumor and matched normal DNA. Enhanced by an AI-based error suppression model, this signature was used to detect ctDNA in 1-2 mL plasma samples using WGS (20x coverage). We used de-novo point mutation and copy number variation analysis to investigate cancer evolution after treatment. To evaluate the reproducibility of MRDetect, aliquot samples (n = 2x190 samples) from 5 recurrence and 10 non-recurrence patients were processed and sequenced at two independent laboratories. Outcome measures: ctDNA status, tumor fraction, false positive rate, Time To ctDNA Recurrence (TTcR), and Time To radiological Recurrence (TTrR).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> Analysis of paired samples showed great reproducibility with high agreement between both ctDNA status calls (Cohens Kappa = 0.81) and the estimated tumor fractions (r<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.99). MRDetect revealed post-operative ctDNA in all recurrence patients (5\/5) with detected tumor fractions down to 2 x 10<sup>-4<\/sup>. Median TTcR was 0.9 month (range 0.5 - 7.3 months) while median TTrR was 12.8 months (range 11.3 - 31.1 months). The false positive rate was 1% (1\/100), assessed in longitudinal samples from the 10 non-relapsing patients. Tumor evolution dynamics in plasma samples revealed novel amplification and deletions, which were absent in the primary tissue but confirmed in metachronous metastases. We will present results from the full cohort at AACR 2022.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>MRDetect detects ctDNA with high sensitivity and specificity and enables effective postoperative assessment of MRD, cancer evolution dynamics and early relapse detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3831ce7d-151a-4fcf-8b4c-50ebd7a22fe5\/@B03B8ZBb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Whole genome sequencing,Liquid biopsies,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12586"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda Frydendahl<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Reinert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesper Nors<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunil Deochand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dillon Maloney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noah Friedman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomer Lauterman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danielle Afterman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Imane Bourzgui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nidhi Ramaraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zohar Donenhirsh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronel Veksler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravi Kandasamy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iman Tavassoly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Rosenfeld<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anders Husted Andersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uffe S.

Despite the growing body of evidence establishing TB as a strong independent prognostic marker in CRC, further investigation is needed to elucidate the biological mechanisms behind TB and its invasive potential. Pseudobudding (PsB), in contrast to TB, is defined as single cancer cells or clusters of up to four cells that occur due to gland disruption and external influences such as inflammation. We hypothesize that the invasive potential of a tumor is therefore better reflected by the active process of TB rather than through the reactive process of PsB. By improved visualization of the invasive tumor front, we can characterize TB and PsB, elucidate their underlying biological processes, and improve future TB scoring accuracy in routine diagnostic practice.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> Cases containing TB and PsB were selected from the pathology archives. Thick sections (80-90&#181;m) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRC tissue were taken using a microtome and stained using a free-floating immunostaining protocol for Pan-cytokeratin (epithelium) and DAPI (nuclei). Thick sections were imaged via confocal microscopy. Three-dimensional z-stacks were processed and analyzed using FIJI software. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) of regions with TB and PsB were created and RNA spatial transcriptomics was conducted on thin TMA sections (5&#181;m) using the Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling Platform.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> For sections where the invasive margin contained TB, both single cells and cell clusters appear isolated from the core tumor in 3D. These single cells and cell clusters exhibit migratory and invasive features associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evident by complete loss of cell-to-cell adhesions and shape shifting through elongation of the entire cell. In contrast, PsB is characterized by cellular debris surrounding a discontinuous epithelial lining. Undivided cells and cell clusters within the damaged area are observed as involuntarily disassociated with lagging remnants of cell-to-cell adhesions. This may be due to inflammatory cells disrupting the extracellular matrix and pulling the cells apart from one another. The identification of differing morphologies allows for further study of the RNA spatial transcriptome (of which the data will be presented during the meeting).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our findings show that TB and PsB are independent features within the invasive tumor margin which represent two separate biological processes. Considering the strong predictive capacity of TB as a marker of poor prognosis in CRC, TB scoring within routine diagnostic practice benefits from avoiding areas with a strong inflammatory reaction and PsB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9f9200c9-d5cd-41df-928e-462ca6770b24\/@B03B8ZBb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Prognostic markers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12813"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tariq Haddad<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luuk Van den Dobbelsteen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Lugli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shannon Van Lent-van Vliet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Femke Simmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inti Zlobec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Nagtegaal<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, it is critical to identify prognostic markers for the early detection of an aggressive subtype. We hypothesized that tissue specimens from early-stage, low risk CaP may harbor predictive prognostic signatures for disease progression after radical prostatectomy. Previously, we had systematically evaluated and optimized the NanoString platform for CaP gene expression analysis in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) whole mounted prostate specimens. The goal of the study is to validate the CPDR findings on the differential mRNA expression of candidate markers from patients with BCR (biochemical recurrence) and non-BCR in an independent cohort.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This is a retrospective case cohort study based on 78 tumor-normal paired (N=156) archived whole mounted FFPE prostate samples received from biobank at UTHSCSA. We performed an optimized NanoString analysis of 203-CaP probe set to evaluate the association of markers with BCR outcome in a racially diverse patient population comprising of 21.6% AA and 78.38% CA men. The cohort comprised of 28 patients with BCR, and 50 patients with no BCR (based on a minimum of 5 years of follow-up). ERG gene expression was validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay using CPDR ERG-MAb (9FY). Normalized nCounter gene expression data was analyzed using the NanoString nSolver (v 4.0) platform. Fisher exact and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used for categorical and continuous variables respectively.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found 96.1% (73\/76) concordance between ERG IHC and NanoString datasets, which provides strong QC and validation for NanoString data. ERG positive tumors had strong expression of both <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> fusion and several other ERG splice forms. Additionally, the prostate epithelial cell markers <i>PSA , MSMB<\/i> and <i>PAP<\/i> had the highest signals in all samples reflecting the prostate epithelial origin of the specimens. Differential gene expression analysis showed that a total of 37 genes were found to be significantly (P adj &#60;0.05) different across tumors and normal. Established CaP genes like <i>AMACR, PCA3, OR51E2, ERG, HOXC6, DLX1, CACNA1D<\/i> and <i>PSGR<\/i> were most highly over-expressed in tumors compared to matched normal while <i>GSTP1, CAV1, PAP<\/i> and <i>MSMB <\/i>were significantly downregulated in tumors compared to adjacent normal prostate epithelia.

However, the presence of ER\/PR is not inherently reflective of <i>estrogen driven tumor growth<\/i>. Previously, ER pathway activity score (ERPAS), a test to asses ER pathway, was shown to reflect <i>estrogen driven tumor growth<\/i> and to have additional prognostic and predictive value over ER and PR-IHC. Within the four molecular subgroups of EC, ER and PR-IHC are present in all subgroups. Yet, the relation of ERPAS with molecular subgroups is unclear. In this study we aim to identify <i>estrogen driven tumor growth<\/i> by application of ERPAS in the molecular subgroups.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> ER and PR-IHC expression, ERPAS testing and molecular analysis was available in 72 endometrial cancer cases. ER and PR-IHC expression was analyzed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor sections using standard procedures. A cut-off value of 10% was defined as positive. ERPAS was performed using RT-qPCR analysis of the most relevant ER-related genes (www.philips.com\/oncosignal). A Bayesian computational model was used to infer ERPAS that were normalized on a scale from 0 to 100. The cut-off value for an active ER pathway was 29.7, as previously defined. Molecular analysis was performed using Next Generation Sequencing with single-molecule Molecular Inversion Probes (smMIPs). Accordingly patients were grouped in the <i>POLE-mutant<\/i>, MSI high, <i>TP53-mutant<\/i> or no specific molecular profile, NSMP group.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The <i>TP53<\/i>-mutant<i>-<\/i>group had a worse outcome compared to other groups. ER pathway was active in 75% of <i>POLE<\/i>-mutant, 83.3% of MSI-high, 87.5% of NSMP and 38.9% of <i>TP53<\/i>-mutant<i> <\/i>cases. Similarly, PR-IHC expression was present in 100% of <i>POLE<\/i>-mutant, 72.2% of MSI-high, 81.3% of NSMP and 27.8% of <i>TP53<\/i>-mutant cases. The mean ERPAS was significantly higher in MSI-high and NSMP groups compared to the <i>TP53<\/i>-mutant group. Within the NSMP subgroup, an active ER pathway was significantly associated with improved disease-free survival and disease-specific survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis. Analysis in other subgroups was not possible due to limited number of cases.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The majority of <i>POLE<\/i>-mutant, MSI-high and NSMP tumors showed an active ER pathway, indicating relevance of estrogen driven tumor growth in these groups. In the NSMP subgroup, ERPAS can be used to stratify patients for prognosis. Whether ER pathway is prognostic in the MSI-high and <i>TP53<\/i>-mutant subgroups needs to be evaluated in larger cohorts. If hormonal therapy is applied, we suggest to tailor it to patient with an active ER pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b920fb2e-d3c9-47fb-a779-dee2ebab7429\/@B03B8ZBb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Estrogen receptor,Molecular subtypes,Progesterone receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12815"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Willem Jan Van Weelden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Vrede<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louis Van der Putten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hans Bulten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Snijders<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanne Sweegers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Romano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Astrid Eijkelenboom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anja Van de Stolpe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Johanna Pijnenborg<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Certain spatial patterns of immune and stroma cells within tumors have been correlated with treatment response across cancer types, including breast cancer. Mechanical and physical microenvironmental signatures have emerged as drivers of cancer aggressiveness and invasiveness. This suggests that physio\/mechanical structures may drive the formation of favorable immune-tumor-stroma cell patterns. In this work, we use a novel 60-marker imaging mass cytometry panel that included 16 tumor markers, 20 immune markers and 24 microenvironmental markers to resolve spatial patterns of cells, mechanical, structural, and other biomarkers within 700 clinical tumor samples (tissue microarrays from untreated primary breast cancers). <i>Table 1 Sample distribution, patients were also treated surgically.<\/i><table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{8A4F48AF-8D52-4075-A97C-0E82544A1034}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Long-term survival<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cohort<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Survival<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Breast cancer death<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N samples<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">174<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">113<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Long-term disease status<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Disease-free<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">94%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Local reoccurrence<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">59%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Distant reoccurrence<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">27%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Treatment<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No adjuvant treatment<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Adj. radiation<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Adj. chemo<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Adj. endocrine<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">28%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Adj .rad + chemo<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Adj. rad + endocrine<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">35%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Adj. chemo + endocrine<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Adj. rad + chemo + endocrine<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>Imaging and clinical data (eg. pathology, treatment, 10+ years survival) were integrated and analyzed to extract cell phenotypes, neighboring cells\/markers and establish cell density, microenvironmental marker presence, and repeating spatial cell\/marker patterns in all samples.

Conversely, breast cancer death samples exhibited upregulation of Na+\/K+ ATPase, hCA9, and Ki67. Moreover, we identified that the co-localization of mechanical markers such as Integrin &#946;1 and Plakoglobin is a signature of tumors with poor outcome, while the individual presence of either does not affect survival. For each of the cells\/markers studied, we investigated functional relationships and identified clusters that drive survival such as Vimentin+\/&#946;-actin+ B cells, which suggests that the role of mechanics is critical to the tumor-controlling functions of immune cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/649d8af9-b257-41ee-b6f6-e7b4630c0748\/@B03B8ZBb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Survival,Tumor microenvironment,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12816"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara Nizzero<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Licheng Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yitian Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria J.

Variations in the mtDNA sequence can act as functional adaptors allowing tumor and immune cells to adjust the metabolic needs imposed by various tissue environments during cancer progression. Recent reports have demonstrated that the entire mitochondrial genome can be encapsulated and secreted in EVs. However, the biological attributes of secreted cell-free mtDNA still remain insufficiently understood, mostly because of the difficulty in isolating and characterizing the entire mitochondrial genomes. Here, we present the results from sequencing of mtDNA from various blood compartments, including EVs, and tumor tissue from CRC patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Plasma EVs (median mode size 136.4 nm) were isolated by size exclusion chromatography. We compared the mtDNA in EVs with that in whole blood (WB), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from eight rectal cancer patients. Total DNA was isolated from the four tissue types before the mtDNA was enriched by applying two different PCR approaches with either multiple (for FFPE tumor) or only two (for EVs, WB, and PBMCs) primer sets prior to NGS analysis. WB- and fresh-frozen (FF) tumor mtDNA from eight colon cancer patients was sequenced as controls for the two PCR primer approaches. mtDNA sequence mapping and variant analyses were done using the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence, and HaploGrep2- and Variant Effect Predictor softwares.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> EV mtDNA presented twice as many variants with significantly more heteroplasmy (mutant mtDNA copies mixed with wild-type copies) than mtDNA from WB and PBMCs. The proportion of EV mtDNA variants that were non-synonymous (i.e. estimated to affect the mitochondrial function) was significantly higher than in WB. FFPE tumors, requiring the multi-primer approach, showed a manyfold increase in detected mtDNA variants, which was not observed for FF tumor mtDNA amplified like WB mtDNA. However, several mtDNA variants detected in FFPE- and FF tumors were not retrieved in WB.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We successfully isolated and sequenced the mtDNA cargo of plasma EVs for comparison with mtDNA in WB, PBMCs, and tumor tissue from CRC patients. The EV mtDNA exhibited higher diversity than in the other blood compartments, with a higher degree of heteroplasmy and more variants with impact on the mitochondrial function. The majority of additional mtDNA variants detected in FFPE tumors were possibly caused by technical biases (the tissue processing or mtDNA amplification procedure). Plasma EVs may be involved in the metabolic homeostasis of tumor and immune cells in CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/53360475-7331-496c-9c8b-ca2aac181ca7\/@B03B8ZBb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondrial DNA,Extracellular vesicles,Colorectal cancer,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12832"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tonje Bjørnetrø<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paula A.

Treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy induces remission in up to 80% of patients yet the majority relapse and die from their disease within 5 years. We recently reported the analysis of patients with advanced ovarian cancers using plasma metabolomics to predict response and survival (D&#8217;Amora et al Gynecol Oncol, October 2021). As part of that study human tumor explants were submitted for the measurement of platinum resistance by ex vivo analysis of programmed cell death (EVA\/PCD<sup>TM<\/sup>). Media obtained from the non-drug exposed control cultures were examined by mass spectrometry for the quantification of 186 individual metabolites using the Biocrates&#8217; p180 platform. Results obtained with the tissue culture media identify biochemical signatures that correlate with the achievement of complete pathologic remission. Among the most discrimination findings were the media concentrations of phosphatidyl choline (PC) aa c42:0 and the ratio of (PC) aa C40:2 divided by (PC) ae C42:1 suggesting either hyperactivity of lipid elongases or defective beta oxidation of very long chain fatty acids in drug refractory patients. When we compared the results of 8 patients who achieved pCR with 3 patients with residual disease the aa C42:0 concentration and the ratio aa C42:0\/ae C42:1 provided an AUC= 0.958 (p. &#60; 0.01) The findings suggest that peroxisomal dysfunction leads to the accumulation of very long chain fatty acid lipids. These species are known to induce endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress and are associated with the neurodegenerative diseases like Zellweger syndrome. We have reported similar findings in drug refractory breast cancer patients (da Silva et al, Oncotarget, August Aug 2018) suggesting common lipid metabolic changes in drug resistant adenocarcinomas.

This expression was related with patients&#8217; clinical outcome. Current study investigates for the first time, the expression of JUNB and CXCR4 in CTCs from patients with Non-Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC) and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Forty four patients were enrolled in this study (30 NSCLC and 14 SCLC patients, before the initiation of 1<sup>st<\/sup> line treatment). ISET system was used for NSCLC patients' samples preparation, while the CTCs from SCLC patients were isolated using Ficoll density gradient. Triple immunofluorescence experiments were performed, using CK, JUNB, and CXCR4 antibodies. Results conducted using confocal laser scanning microscopy for NSCLC samples and the VyCAP system for SCLC samples.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Sixteen out of 30 NSCLC patients (53.33%), were positive for CTCs, while all SCLC patients harbored CK-positive cells. Most common phenotypes in CK-positive NSCLC patients were the [(CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4+): 50% (8\/16patients)], [(CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4-): 43.75%, (7\/16)] and the [(CK+\/JUNB-\/CXCR4-): 37.5% (6\/16)]. Less frequent phenotype was the [(CK+\/JUNB-\/CXCR4+): 6.25%, (1\/16)]. Analysis of the mean isolated CTCs\/patient revealed that most of the isolated CTCs belonged to the (CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4+) phenotype (42.19%), while less frequent were the (CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4-): 33.13%, (CK+\/JUNB-\/CXCR4-): 18.44% and the (CK+\/JUNB-\/CXCR4+): 6.25% phenotypes. Survival analysis revealed that the presence of (CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4+) was related to poorer OS (cox regression: p=0.008) and PFS (Log Rank, p=0.014) All SCLC patients had detectable CTCs in their blood with 13 out of 14 of them having the (CK+\/JUNB-\/CXCR4-) phenotype (92.86%). The rest of CTC&#8217;s phenotypes (CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4+), (CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4-) and (CK+\/JUNB-\/CXCR4+) where found in 10 out of 14 patients (71.43%) each. Examination of the mean percentage of the total isolated CTCs\/patient indicated that the (CK+\/JUNB-\/CXCR4-) phenotype was the most frequent (49.71%), while the percentages for the rest phenotypes were [(CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4-): 25.94%], [(CK+\/JUNB-\/CXCR4+): 12.65%] and (CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4+): 11.70%].<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>JUNB and CXCR4 were upregulated in CTCs from NSCLC and SCLC patients. However, in NSCLC the most frequent phenotype (CK+\/JUNB+\/CXCR4+) was also related to patients&#8217; outcome, underlying the key role of these molecules in metastatic dissemination. Further examination will determine the role of this expression in all lung cancer subtypes. <i>Acknowledge: This research has been co&#8208;financed by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH - CREATE - INNOVATE (project code: T2&#917;&#916;&#922;-01562).<\/i><i><\/i><i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c26615f2-c828-401a-a51b-852594d49ccd\/@B03B8ZBb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,CXCR4,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Lung cancer: small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12835"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Argyro Roumeliotou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evangelia Pantazaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anastasia Xagara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Makatsoris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelos Koutras<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vassilis Georgoulias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Athanasios Kotsakis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Galaktia Kallergi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Although there are prognostic biomarkers available, identifying them requires intraocular tumor biopsy. Blood biopsy has emerged as a significantly less invasive alternative that also offers the ability to longitudinally track disease. However, blood biopsy has been unsuccessful for clinical use in identifying prognostic biomarkers in UM due to low detection rates. Thus, eye-specific aqueous humor (AH) biopsy may be a better alternative.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This case series includes 20 primary UM patients with 13 (65%) choroid and 7 (35%) ciliary body (CB) tumors. AH samples were collected prior to brachytherapy plaque placement (n = 17), after brachytherapy (n = 19) and at enucleation (n = 1). A tumor wash sample (n = 1) was collected after routine fine needle aspiration biopsy. Nucleic acids ([NA], dsDNA, RNA, ssDNA and miRNA) were quantitated by Qubit Assay Kits. All AH samples and cells from tumor washing underwent DNA isolation and was followed by shallow whole-genome sequencing for copy-number profiling.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><i> <\/i>Comparison of pre- and post-radiation samples revealed significantly higher concentration of ssDNA (n = 10 pairs, P = 0.039) and miRNA (n = 10 pairs, P = 0.008) in choroid post- samples and significantly higher concentration of dsDNA (n = 7 pairs, P = 0.031) and miRNA (n = 7 pairs, P = 0.016) in CB post- samples. Between choroid (n = 12) and CB (n = 7) post- samples, there was a significantly higher concentration of dsDNA (P = 0.022) and RNA (P = 0.009) in post- CB samples, suggesting NA content is released from the disturbance of tumor cells by radiation and due to the proximity of the tumor to the AH in CB. Highly recurrent UM somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) of monosomy 3, 6p gain, 6q loss and 8q gain were identified in post- AH samples. There was a significant difference between altered SCNA profiles in CB and choroid (P= 0.038). Altered SCNA profiles were found in 1\/12 (8.3%) and 4\/7 (57.1%) post-radiation AH samples of choroid and CB, respectively. No SCNAs were found in the same eyes&#8217; pre-radiation sample. A high concordance of DNA profiles between a tumor wash and post- AH sample was identified (r = 0.978) and UM mutations GNAQ and BAP1 were detected in 3\/6 (50%) post- AH with 2\/5 (40%) matching tumor samples, demonstrating AH dsDNA&#8217;s tumor-origin.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b><i> <\/i>The AH is a source of cfDNA, with a higher yield of NAs after radiation in UM. Given the significant increase in NA concentration after radiation and in CB compared to choroid tumors, we hypothesize that all detected NAs post-radiation are tumor-derived due to apoptosis of tumor cells and subsequent release of cfDNA and due to the proximity of the CB tumor to AH. These results represent the first time that UM SCNAs and mutations were identified in cfDNA isolated from the AH, and this suggests that the AH can serve as a liquid biopsy for UM, especially in CB tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad0ae845-d474-4bd4-add5-e561485d7718\/@B03B8ZBb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Uveal melanoma,Aqueous humor,Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21374"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Deborah H.
