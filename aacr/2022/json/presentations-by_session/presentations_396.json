[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Infiltrating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most fatal human malignancies, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 10%. The PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by a fibroinflammatory response mediated by a complex mix of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subsets resulting significant deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), poor vascularization, T cell exclusion, and recruitment of immune-suppressive myeloid cells. Collectively, these factors contribute to a resistance to aggressive chemotherapeutics and failure of checkpoint inhibitors. Preclinical studies as well as clinical efforts designed to deplete the dense tumor stroma or ECM have been successful, but unexpectedly accelerated tumor progression underscoring critical gaps in our understanding of the dynamics between tumor, stromal elements, and infiltrating immune cell subsets.<br \/><b>Rationale:<\/b> In some cancer subtypes, B cells have been shown to suppress cancer progression through secretion of antibodies targeted to aberrantly expressed self-, stress-associated-, or tumor-specific antigens on neoplastic cells. A considerable body of literature also indicates that B cells may play a role in promotion of pancreatic tumor progression, however, the role of antibodies in PDAC progression is unclear. <u>The major objective of our studies is to understand the significance of anti-tumor antibody responses in pancreatic tumorigenesis<\/u>.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To address this question, we crossed the spontaneous mouse model of pancreatic cancer where <i>Pdx1 <\/i>drives Cre-mediated activation of a mutant <i><u>K<\/u>ras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> allele on a heterozygous <i>T<\/i><u><i>p<\/i><\/u><i>53<\/i><sup>+\/FL <\/sup>mutant background (KPC-WT mice) with animals that retain B cells that lack the ability to secrete antibody of any immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype (KPC-&#956;S-AID mice).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Kaplan-Meier survival studies demonstrate that loss of all circulating antibody accelerates progression to lethal PDAC in KPC-&#956;S-AID versus KPC-WT mice (median survival of 3- versus 5-months, respectively), with increased incidence of lung and liver metastases. Further, loss of circulating antibodies increased the density of intratumoral neutrophils, reduced numbers of podoplanin<sup>+<\/sup> CAFs and reduced ECM density. IgG subclass antibodies were localized at higher densities within stroma\/ECM in pancreata from both mice and surgically resected tumor specimens from human PDAC patients. Loss of AID-dependent class switched antibodies similarly accelerated lethal PDAC in KPC-AID versus KPC-WT mice.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These findings implicate class-switched antibodies in delaying pancreatic tumor progression through potential regulation of intratumoral neutrophil density and ECM production within the PDAC TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d78c4b4a-698d-43e8-8c54-0f11c3d7fcf2\/@A03B8ZH4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Pancreatic cancer,Extracellular matrix,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14546"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeremy Foote<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Due to the paucity of human cases, there is a drive to develop model systems to improve our understanding of the pathology underlying this disease and screen new treatment strategies. Spontaneous canine HS exhibits increased prevalence in specific breeds, shares key genetic and biologic similarities with the human disease, and occurs in an immunocompetent setting. Our previous studies revealed a spectrum of hot and cold immune tumor microenvironments (TME) based on tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) quantification in 18 canine and 5 human HS cases. In dogs, increased TIL densities were positively associated with longer survival times. Despite this association, the disease course of HS in our veterinary patient cohort was nearly uniformly fatal. To evaluate for potential inhibitors of T cell immunity in the TME and identify putative drivers and suppressors of HS, we performed immune transcription profiling. Tumors were selected from 3 short-lived cases of splenic HS that were sparsely infiltrated with TIL and 3 long-lived cases of pulmonary HS that were T cell inflamed. Tumors were compared to corresponding grossly healthy splenic and lung tissues collected from 3 dogs without neoplasia undergoing routine post-mortem examination. RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues and immune transcription profiling was performed using the NanoString nCounter Canine IO Panel. Analyses of all tumors compared to normal tissues, and subset analyses of tissues stratified based on tissue origin site, revealed enrichment of ITGAX (CD11c) expression in the HS tumor samples consistent with histiocytic origin. In each subset analysis, SPP1 (osteopontin) was highly expressed in HS tumors compared with normal tissues. Osteopontin has been shown to be protumorigenic in a variety of cancers, is a potent chemokine for macrophages, and can suppress T cell activation through ligation of CD44, thus acting as a T cell checkpoint. Additionally, we found decreased expression of TXNIP in HS tumors compared to healthy tissues. TXNIP is an established tumor suppressor gene in various tumor types, including acute myeloid leukemia. Future studies will interrogate the functional implications of these transcriptional changes with the aim of developing novel therapeutic strategies for HS in both species.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d1af7e5b-f648-4dac-9860-2342e352faaf\/@s03B8ZH5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteopontin,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Animal models,Tumor suppressor gene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14549"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer A.

Tumor cells secrete PD-L1 through exosomes or splice variants, which has been described as a new mechanism for the resistance to PD-L1 blockade therapy in multiple cancers. Our previous findings showed that the histone acetyltransferases p300\/CBP could be recruited to the promoter of CD274 (encoding PD-L1) to regulate the expression of PD-L1. P300\/CBP inhibition abrogated this process and reduced the secretion of exosomal PD-L1 by blocking the transcription of CD274, which combined with the anti-PD-L1 antibody to reactivate T cells function for tumor attack. In this study we have tested the outcome of combined immune checkpoint inhibitors with CCS1477, a novel p300\/CBP bromodomain inhibitor, in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer and melanoma.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> CCS1477 significantly decreased human prostate (DU145\/PC-3) and melanoma (A375\/SK-MEL-28) cancer cell line PD-L1 expression, as well as exosome secreted PD-L1 after 24 hours treatment. Moreover, consistent with these findings <i>in vitro<\/i>, CCS1477 (2.5mg\/\/kg) also reduced PD-L1 expression in a syngeneic mouse prostate model (TRAMP-C2) and syngeneic mouse melanoma model (B16-F10). Meanwhile, CCS1477 treatment significantly increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in syngeneic mouse models. Monotherapy treatment with CCS1477 or immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1 antibody for prostate cancer or anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4 antibody for melanoma) resulted in significant but modest efficacy. Strikingly, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with CCS1477 showed robust synergistic responses resulting in tumor regression. Mechanistically, CCS1477 treatment induced significant loss of H3K27 acetylation from super-enhancers of CD274, which subsequently induced a significant reduction of PD-L1 expression and exosome secreted-PD-L1. Also, we found that CCS1477 treatment significantly decreased the abundance of circulating and tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are known to play important roles in tumor immune evasion by inhibiting T cell&#8217;s activation. Reduction of MDSCs and exosome secreted-PD-L1 preserved T-cell function and elicited robust immunotherapy response combined with immune checkpoint blockade agents.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These observations illuminate a clinically relevant hypothesis for combining CCS1477 with immune checkpoint blockade in the treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ca7f235a-6107-457f-8b26-6d705548ca01\/@s03B8ZH5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p300,PD-L1,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14550"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jinghui Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katelyn Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nigel Brooks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil Pegg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoqi Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

While immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has resulted in major breakthroughs in some cancers, the response in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer has been disappointing. High density of infiltrating T cells has been associated with improved overall survival and response to ICI. We previously found that T cell infiltration varied considerably in a cohort of MSS CLM cases, which could reflect varying sensitivity to ICI treatment. The aim of this study was to quantify and characterize T cell infiltration in CLM using T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing (TCRR-seq).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Resection specimens were collected from 85 patients with CLM included in the Oslo CoMet trial (NCT01516710). Of these, 37 and 13 patients had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) within a short or long interval, respectively, prior to resection, while 35 had not (no-NACT group). TCRR-seq libraries were prepared from DNA extracted from CLM tissue using the hsTCRB kit from Adaptive Biotechnologies, which allows both quantitative and qualitative analysis of TCR repertoires. The T cell fraction relative to the total number of cells was estimated for each CLM sample. Repertoire clonality was analyzed using Hill diversity profiles, a mathematical framework for determining species diversity derived from the ecological literature. Network analyses were conducted to analyze convergence of clonal T cell receptor amino acid sequences in each repertoire.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The mean CLM T cell fraction was 8.1% (0.4-31.3%), and tumors with high T cell fraction had more monoclonal repertoires (p=1.86E<sup>-6<\/sup>). Interestingly, CLM from patients in the short interval group had increased T cell infiltration compared to the no-NACT and long interval groups (mean 10.5% and 6.3%, respectively; p=0.04), and these repertoires were also more monoclonal (p=0.003). Network analysis revealed that clonally expanded T cells tended to exhibit little overall receptor similarity to other T cells in the repertoire. Clonally expanded T cells were overall also private (unique) to each patient.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>A short interval between exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgical resection was associated with increased T cell infiltration in CLM samples, and the increase was associated with clonal expansion. The findings suggest that chemotherapy could be a driver of clonal expansion in this setting, possibly by induction of immunogenic cell death.

Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells are known to be potential biomarkers in predicting a patient&#8217;s survival and response to ICI. Several studies showed that NSCLC patients with smoking history had a better response than never smokers due to increased TMB caused by carcinogens in cigarette smoke. However, the roles of tumor microenvironment especially immune microenvironment between smokers and never smokers in response to ICI are poorly understood. We hypothesize that the functions of T cells are influenced by the exposure of cigarette smoke prior to the ICI treatment which affect patients&#8217; response to ICI.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> A cohort of 216 patients diagnosed with NSCLC who had received at least one dosage of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) at Atrium Wake Forest Baptist Hospital were split into three groups: current smokers, former smokers, and never-smokers. Both PFS and OS analyses were performed to examine whether smoking history is correlated with the ICI response. To establish an in vivo model that recapitulates the patients with different smoking history, we treated mice with cigarette extract (CSE) followed by accessing the peripheral T cell functions by FACS analyses using antibodies targeting GZMB, TNF and IFNG. LL\/2 and CMT167 cells will be inoculated to those CSE treated mice by flank injection once we observe a stable activation of T cells compared to control group. Tumor growth will be measured and the amount of tumor infiltrated CD4 and CD8 T cells will be examined by immunocytochemistry at the end point.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We found it took around 9 weeks of CSE treatment to observe a significant increase of CD8 and CD4 populations in CSE treated mice. We also treated mouse CD8 T cells isolated from the spleen with CSE and observed a strong activation of GZMB, TNF and IFNG by FACS analyses.<br \/><b>Future directions: <\/b>We will test the efficacy of anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-1 ab in tumor bearing mice exposed with or without CSE prior to the immune therapy. We will also establish a mice model that mimics the former smokers by halting the CSE treatment after 9 weeks of CSE exposure followed by examine the amount of memory T cells. We believe our study will provide additional mechanisms of how cigarette smoke affects the response of ICI by affecting the properties of immune cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/14a56e88-9ce4-4bfc-ae06-1fc0e01679f1\/@s03B8ZH5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Immunotherapy,Animal models,Smoking,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14552"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Margaret Rose Smith<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuezhu Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jimmy Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Grayson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Xing<\/i><\/presenter>.

Expression of low-molecular-weight cyclin E (LMW-E) is associated with more aggressive disease in all BrCa subtypes. While tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are more abundant in LMW-E+ tumors, high-TIL\/LMW-E+ tumors have lower probability of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We hypothesized that LMW-E induces immune changes that create a permissive microenvironment in the mammary gland for promoting tumor initiation and subsequent growth. We aimed to evaluate the role of mammary epithelial expression of LMW-E in the temporal induction of systemic and local immune responses that ultimately prime the mammary gland for tumor development.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We generated a tri-transgenic mouse model capable of conditionally expressing human LMW-E under the control of the MMTV promoter in a p53 heterozygous background (MPT) upon doxycycline (Dox) administration. Female MPT mice were treated with Dox for 3, 6 and 9 months and age-matched untreated controls were sacrificed at each time point. An independent group of non-transgenic mice in a p53 heterozygous background were maintained +\/- Dox as positive and negative controls. Mammary glands and peripheral organs (spleen, lung, bone marrow) were harvested for immune profiling by flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence microscopy (mIF). Serum was also collected for cytokine\/chemokine assessment. Immune profiling via flow cytometry was performed using two multi-color panels to assess basic immune and more specialized T-cell subsets. For the mIF experiments, two 5-marker panels were applied to mammary tissue.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Histological examination of MPT mammary glands over time showed a temporal increase in acinar proliferation and mitotic figures, which was further confirmed by the co-localization of panCK+ and Ki-67+ markers. We report that although immune cell frequencies changed with age, these specific changes were dependent on LMW-E induction as compared to the non-transgenic cohort of mice. LMW-E+ mammary glands showed a temporal enrichment in B cells, macrophages, T cells (CD4+, PD1+, CD4+Ki67+, and T<sub>regs<\/sub>), cDCs, and panCK+, panCK+vimentin+ populations over time. By contrast, pDCs increased from 3 to 6 months but decreased in the pre-tumorigenic mammary gland of the 9-month old LMW-E+ mice.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> LMW-E induction mediates an increase in epithelial cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition events that result in local immune alterations, specifically affecting T-cell subsets. Our findings suggest that the immunological changes driven by LMW-E lead to an immunosuppressive microenvironment that may promote tumor formation at the early stages of breast tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7388fd1a-2e78-4f7c-9bc9-1c5b209a4483\/@s03B8ZH5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle regulation,Immune response,Cyclin E,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14554"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sofia Mastoraki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amriti R.

To investigate the influence of hypomethylating agents on the PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling cascade in breast cancer and its implication on possible treatment options, we determined the effect of 5-Azacytidine (5-AZA), decitabine (DAC) and anti-PD1 in mono- and combined therapy on the mouse breast cancer model 4T1 in vitro and in vivo. In a life cell imaging based 2D system we evaluated the influence of the different treatment arms on tumor growth, methylation status and PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, we determined the effect of 5-AZA and DAC on autologous T cells in the presence and absence of 4T1 cancer cells. The combination of 5-AZA and anti-PD1 treatment was further evaluated in an in vivo setting. 24 4T1 bearing balb\/c mice were treated with either an isotype control, 5-AZA, anti-PD1 or a combination of the latter. Tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurement. At the end of the experiment tumor and hematopoietic organs were analyzed by flow cytometry. A panel of 36 murine cytokines was determined in the murine serum at different time points. Low dose 5-AZA (IC10) and DAC (IC2.5) induced a down regulation of PD-L1 on 4T1 cells in vitro. Interestingly, this effect was most prominent at the dose level and time point when the hypomethylation effect of the respective compound was most pronounced (day 7). 5-AZA and DAC induced an upregulation of PD-1 on autologous CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells. Of note, 4T1 cells reduced the expression of PD-1 on autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Antitumoral activity in vitro was determined in all treatment arms. An additive effect of the combination was specifically determined when combining 5-AZA and anti PD-1. Hence, 5-AZA and anti PD-1 were investigated in vivo more in detail. 4T1 is characterized by an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment as indicated by the in vitro results: we determined a reduced CD4\/CD8 ratio and a high percentage of MDSC. These features were reverted by the applied treatments. Along the same line, 5-AZA in mono- and in combination therapy with anti-PDL1 specifically increased the G-CSF levels in murine serum. In addition, the PDL-1 downregulation on the tumor cells was reproduced in vivo. Finally, the combination arm displayed the most prominent antitumoral activity. In summary, we have strong evidence that low dose hypomethylating agents influence the immune landscape of breast cancer via the modulation of PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling. The combination with checkpoint inhibitors was superior to the monotherapy and might lead to new treatment options for breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1414346d-15af-4813-a1e2-4b2a9a4ab511\/@s03B8ZH5\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Preclinical testing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14555"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia Schüler<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agon Kolica<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hung Ngyuen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Edinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kanstantsin Lashuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Oswald<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, PS is constitutively externalized in the tumor microenvironment (TME); on viable cells that undergo stress, such as hypoxic tumor cells, stressed tumor vascular endothelial cells, as well as on cells undergoing apoptosis. This high PS harbors a pro-tumorigenic micro-environment, as myeloid cells expressing PS receptors (Mertk, Tyro3 and Axl) engage with externalized PS and secrete immunosuppressive cytokines. PS is externalized on viable cells by a calcium activated scramblase TMEM16F and on apoptotic cells by a caspase activated scramblase called Xkr8. Here, to study the mechanisms by which PS is externalized in the TME, we hypothesize that TMEM16F and Xkr8 are the major scramblases responsible for creating an immune suppressive milieu in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To study the mechanisms of PS dysregulation in the tumor microenvironment, TMEM16F and Xkr8 were knocked out in E0771 murine breast cancer cell line using CRISPR\/Cas9. The knockouts were validated by western blotting, q-RT-PCR and surveyor assays.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>TMEM16F KO E0771 cells express lower basal levels of PS compared to WT E0771 cells when detected by Annexin V staining by flow cytometry. TMEM16F KO cells are also less responsive to activation by calcium ionophore. TMEM16F KO, Xkr8 KO and WT E0771 cells have similar viability and migration patterns in response to Gas6, indicating that the cells themselves do not have altered oncogenic potential. TMEM16F KO E0771 cells injected into the inguinal mammary gland fat pad of C57BL6 syngeneic mice showed modest but significantly reduced tumor growth compared to the E0771 WT tumors, suggesting that TMEM16F mediated PS externalization could play a role in exacerbating tumor progression.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>TMEM16F driven PS externalization contributes to tumor growth. The effect of TMEM16F KO on immune regulation of the tumor milieu will be discussed.

However, little is understood regarding the role of native progesterone (P4), signaling through the progesterone receptor (PR), in breast tumor formation. Recently, we reported a link between PR and immune signaling pathways, showing that P4\/PR can repress type I interferon signaling pathways. Given these findings, we sought to investigate whether P4\/PR drive immunomodulation in the mammary gland and promote tumor formation. To determine the effect of P4 on immune cell populations in the murine mammary gland, mice were treated with P4 or placebo pellets for 21 days. We found that mice treated with P4 exhibited changes in the mammary gland indicative of an inhibited immune response compared to placebo-treated mice. To assess the effect of PR overexpression on mammary gland tumor development as well as immune cell populations in the mammary gland, a transgenic mouse model was used in which PR is overexpressed throughout the entire mouse. Immune cell populations were assessed in the mammary glands by flow cytometry, which revealed decreased numbers of various immune cell populations. Transgenic mice were also monitored for mammary gland tumor development over a 2-year timespan. Following development of mammary gland tumors, immune cell populations in the tumors and spleens of transgenic and control mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. Upon long-term monitoring, we determined that multi-parous PR overexpressing mice developed significantly more mammary gland tumors than control mice. Additionally, tumors from PR overexpressing mice contained fewer infiltrating immune cells, and RNA sequencing analysis of tumor samples revealed that immune-related gene signatures were lower in tumors from PR overexpressing mice as compared to control mice. Finally, we utilized syngeneic mammary gland tumor models to evaluate the effect of P4 on the growth of PR+ mammary gland tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>, which revealed that P4 promoted tumor growth and decreased immune cell infiltration of PR+ mammary gland tumors. Together, these findings offer a novel mechanism of P4-driven mammary gland tumor development and provide rationale in investigating the usage of anti-progestin therapies to promote immune-mediated elimination of mammary gland tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/783b455c-cdf5-4240-a530-b40087c07a9a\/@s03B8ZH5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunomodulation,Progesterone,Mammary gland,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14558"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lauryn Rose Werner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katelin A.

Despite much effort, targeted therapies that aim to directly inhibit signalling pathways downstream of KRAS have limited clinical benefits for NSCLC patients, but the recent approval of PD-1\/PD-L1 antibodies has led to striking durable responses. However, only a fraction of patients respond and therefore a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive immune evasion are required in order to broaden the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy.&nbsp;Increasing evidence suggests that oncogenic signalling pathways greatly influence the tumour immune landscape to impair anti-tumour immune responses. We therefore aim to understand the mechanisms by which KRAS signalling mediates immune evasion in lung cancer.<br \/>Current mouse models of KRAS-mutant lung cancer are poorly immunogenic, limiting investigations into tumour-immune interactions. To overcome this, we generated a novel transplantable KRAS-mutant lung cancer model, KPAR1.3, which triggers spontaneous&nbsp;anti-tumour immune responses and is sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade. To identify mechanisms of immune evasion we carried out an&nbsp;<i>in vivo&nbsp;<\/i>pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screen targeting 240 KRAS-regulated genes using this novel immunogenic model. This identified the prostaglandin synthase COX-2 as a mediator of immune evasion and its expression was driven by KRAS in multiple models of mouse and human lung cancer. Loss of COX-2 promoted a pro-inflammatory tumour microenvironment and sensitised tumours to both innate and adaptive anti-tumour immune responses. Furthermore, therapeutic COX inhibition extended the survival of tumour-bearing mice and synergised with PD-1 blockade. Together these data suggest that targeting KRAS-driven mechanisms of immune evasion could broaden the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.<br \/>Since the approval of immunotherapy, a novel class of mutant-specific KRAS-G12C inhibitors have recently been approved for the treatment of KRAS-mutant NSCLC, however acquired drug resistance is common. We are therefore also currently investigating whether the inhibition of the COX-2\/PGE<sub>2<\/sub> axis enhances the therapeutic benefit of KRAS-G12C inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3e8ed56c-015e-49f7-88de-a7ba674f1e98\/@t03B8ZH6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,NSCLC,Screening,COX-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14559"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jesse Boumelha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pablo Romero-Clavijo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie De Carné<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miriam Molina-Arcas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julian Downward<\/i><\/presenter>.

Development of immune-check-point inhibitors (ICI) has greatly changed the treatment of recurrent or metastatic (R\/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) demonstrating durable antitumor response and overall survival (OS) improvement. However, more than 70% of patients do not respond to ICI and, recently, phase III Checkmate 651 trial did not demonstrate OS improvement of first-line ICI vs standard EXTREME regimen (cetuximab (CX) plus 5-fluorouracil\/cisplatin (CDDP) in R\/M HNSCC patients (ESMO2021-LBA36). We have previously showed <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>models of HNSCC the synergistic antitumor interaction of CDDP\/CX combined with the antiepileptic valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) with anticancer and immunomodulatory properties <i>(Iannelli F., 2020)<\/i>. Here we investigate the immunomodulatory effects of VPA\/CDDP\/CX combination, focusing on the induction of \"immunogenic cell death\" (ICD)-like features.<br \/><b>METHODS<\/b>. ICD-related damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) calreticulin (CARL), ATP, HMGB1 and Annexin-A1 (ANXA1) expression was evaluated by western blot, immunofluorescence and\/or bioluminescent assays on HNSCC Cal27 and osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Maturation, migration, cytokines release, and phagocytic capacity of dendritic cells (IL4_DCs) was evaluated incubating IL4-DCs with conditioned medium from untreated\/treated Cal27 cells and\/or in co-culture IL4-DCs\/Cal27 assays by ELISA, cytofluorimetric assays and confocal microscopy.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b>. VPA\/CDDP\/CX combination induced in both U2OS and Cal27 cells, synergistic pre-apoptotic exposure of CARL along with HMGB1, ANXA1 and ATP release as compared with single drugs or doublet combination. Moreover, the triple combination increases IL4-DCs migration towards pretreated Cal27 cells as well as the rate of IL4-DCs phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies released by Cal27 dying cells. Triple combination also induces phenotypical maturation of DCs as shown by the increased surface expression of CD83 and CD86. Furthermore, conditioned medium from VPA\/CDDP\/CX treated Cal27 cells, induced increased release of immune-stimulating cytokines and chemokines IL2, IL1&#946;, TNF&#945;, MIP-1&#945; and G-CSF by IL4-DCs as well as the impairment of immunosuppressive cytokines release IL-10 and VEGF, by VPA\/CDDP\/CX treated Cal27, co-cultured with IL4-DCs. In vivo experiments in immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model using HNSCC AT-84 cells transduced with human-EGFR are ongoing.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION<\/b>. Overall, we demonstrated that VPA\/CDDP\/CX is able to enhance the immunogenicity of HNSCC model by inducing ICD. This mechanistic hypothesis will be tested by assessing ICD biomarkers on samples of patients enrolled in the V-CHANCE phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the CDDP\/CX associated with VPA in R\/M SCCHN patients and recently concluded (NCT02624128).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/061dc5c7-4986-4b86-aed2-6caa48700cfc\/@t03B8ZH6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,HDAC inhibitor,Immunogenic cell death,Chemosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14561"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Federica Iannelli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Ilaria Zotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Serena Roca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Grumetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tania Moccia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlo Vitagliano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Costantini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Capone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Collina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucia Gabriele<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefania Parlato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giulia Romagnoli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Kepp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guido Kroemer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Di Gennaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alfredo Budillon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus, strategies that enhance their functions are an urgent clinical need. Metabolic reprogramming determines T cell fate and function, where glycolysis principally drives an effector phenotype while oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) drives T cell memory [1]. However, the roles of amino acid catabolism in controlling effector and memory CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell fate and function are less well understood [1, 2]. Glutamine is essential for nucleotide biosynthesis and as an anaplerotic fuel source for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Isotope tracing experiments with <sup>13<\/sup>C glutamine or <sup>13<\/sup>C arginine revealed that glutamine is the major source of polyamines in activated CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells. Further, activation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells provokes marked increases in the expression and activity of enzymes that direct polyamine biosynthesis, specifically ornithine decarboxylase (Odc), spermidine synthase (Srm) and spermine synthase (Sms), as well as to increases in the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition of Odc using difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), or genetic deletion of <i>Odc<\/i> using CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from CD4-Cre;<i>Odc<\/i><sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>mice, augments cytokine production in activated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, including IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945; and granzyme B. Further, metabolic flux analysis indicates that DFMO treatment switches the metabolism of activated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells to rely on OxPhos, a phenotype found in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> tissue resident memory (TRM) cells that play key roles in tissue and anti-tumor immunity anti-tumor reactivity . Indeed, inhibition or loss of Odc augments other TRM phenotypes, including increases in CD69<sup>high<\/sup>;CD44<sup>high<\/sup>;S1PR1<sup>low<\/sup>;CD62L<sup>low<\/sup> cells that define the TRM phenotype. In addition, ACT of DFMO treated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells augments their survival <i>in vivo<\/i> and augments the generation of CD69<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup>CD69<sup>+<\/sup>CXCR6<sup>+<\/sup> and Ly6C<sup>+<\/sup> TRMs in the bone marrow. Finally, DFMO treatment enhances IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; production in human TILs, and co-treatment with TGF-&#946; polarizes TILs into CD69<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup> and CD69<sup>+<\/sup>CD49a<sup>+<\/sup> TRM-like cells. We conclude that polyamines are a metabolic check point in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TRM generation and are an actionable target to improve the anti-tumor immunity of T-cell based immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eed0e839-1577-45f7-91ef-c84e90f2df1c\/@t03B8ZH6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polyamines,CD8 T cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14562"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aya G.

The <i>KA\/KA<\/i> lungs display strikingly enlarged sizes, sustained inflammation with increased expression of multiple cytokines and chemokines and marked infiltrating macrophages and T cells, and tissue damage, which look like a &#8220;burning hill&#8221;. To determine a critical event for the pathogenesis of the lung disease and SCC development, in this study, we found that these F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>CSF1R<sup>+<\/sup> monocyte-derived macrophages isolated from <i>KA\/KA<\/i> lungs showed enlarged sizes carrying many lipid droplets and highly expressed the genes that encode proteins involved in lipid metabolism compared to WT. To determine whether the lung lipid concentrations regulate foamy macrophage development, we incubated Raw macrophages with WT or <i>KA\/KA<\/i> lung extract, respectively, and found that <i>KA\/KA<\/i> lung extracts induced lipid droplets and elevated lipid levels and pathways for lipid metabolism compared to WT lung extracts. Furthermore, we found that cytokines including IL-4, IL-6, IL-33, and IFNb, promoted lipid metabolism in Raw macrophages incubated with WT lung extracts, and also stimulated lipid metabolism in human lung SCC SW900 cells. These results suggest that these cytokines, which were highly expressed in <i>KA\/KA<\/i> lungs, contribute to aberrant lipid metabolism. Because IL-4, which is produced by Th2 T cells, promoted lipid metabolism in macrophages and lung SCC cells, we further showed that <i>KA\/KA<\/i> lung CD4 T cells stimulated lipid gene expression in Raw macrophages compared to WT lung CD4 T cells. Depleting CD4 T cells indeed significantly decreased foamy macrophage formation in the lungs of <i>KA\/KA<\/i> mice. Importantly, treatment with a lipid inhibitor reduced IL-4-mediated lipid metabolism in Raw macrophages and human lung SCC SW900 cells, as well as this treatment attenuated lung foamy macrophage numbers and dampened lung SCC development in irradiated <i>KA\/KA<\/i> mice with <i>KA\/KA<\/i> bone marrow transplants. These findings highlight that the interplay between CD4 T cells, macrophages, cytokines, and epithelial cells contribute to a series of biological events in a landscape scale, which promote lung disease and lung SCC development through aberrant lipid metabolism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b727d63-d9a1-40ec-a83b-862d3000331e\/@t03B8ZH6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipid metabolism,Lung squamous cell carcinoma,Foamy macrophages,CD4 T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14563"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gongping Shi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sayantan Banerjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gajendra Jogdand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongmei Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kunio Nagashima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thorkell Andresson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jyoti Shetty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bao Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yinling Hu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Desmoplasia is a hallmark of PDA, which creates a mechanical barrier surrounding the tumor cells, prevents appropriate vascularization and leads to pool immune infiltration. PDA exhibits a &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment characterized by a prominent myeloid cell infiltration, which is extremely immune suppressive. Therefore, PDA has been demonstrated to be resistant to immunotherapy. Indeed, single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has failed in clinical trials for PDA patients. Targeting epigenetic modification is an attractive approach to enable the response to immunotherapy in multiple solid tumor models. To identify epigenetic modulators as potential novel immunotherapeutic targets in PDA, we performed an orthotopic <i>in vivo<\/i> epigenetic CRISPR screen. Prmt5 was screened out as one of the top candidates. Further validation studies showed that <i>Prmt5<\/i> knockdown (KD) alone or in combination with anti PD-1 treatment significantly inhibited the tumor progression. PRMT5 shRNA in combination with PD1 blockade can dramatically altered the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) with influx of effector CD8 T cells and changes in the macrophage\/myeloid populations. Collectively, our work describes PRMT5 as an attracting target which governs tumor immunity in PDA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5321b36d-4760-4b6c-b6e9-93e9ddc6cc70\/@t03B8ZH6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Immunotherapy,CRISPR,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14564"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hai Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiehui Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alireza Khodadadi-Jamayran<\/i><\/presenter>.

While the majority of patients initially respond to these treatments, most go on to develop secondary resistance. The mechanisms underlying this failure of long-term response and successful responses is poorly understood.<br \/>To better understand the factors contributing to successful long-term anti-cancer immune responses, we utilized the YUMMER1.7 (YR1.7) melanoma line to develop a novel model for the evaluation of immunologic memory. We found that mice engrafted with a YR1.7 tumor can be cured by resection, and that subsequent challenge of these mice with the same tumor, even at 20x the cell number, led to expeditious rejection. Using depleting antibodies, we found that memory response were dependent on CD8 and CD4 T cells, and that CD4 depletion alone does not compromise initial responses, but leads to eventual failure of memory. We found no effect of natural killer cell (NK) depletion.<br \/>We performed single cell RNA sequencing on primary and rechallenge tumors from the same mouse, with the same tumor line. We found a phenotype of clonal replacement, in which the effective T cell clones seen in the memory response were non-overlapping with those found in the primary tumor. This implies an extra-tumoral location for these clones in the primary setting or the potential for additional priming of novel T cell clones upon re-challenge.<br \/>Together, these findings suggest a novel insights on the manner and location of T cells needed for anti-cancer memory responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/abf5abdc-2979-4396-a5a5-6194d710f5b1\/@t03B8ZH6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,T cell,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14565"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew Daniels<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Damsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meaghan McGeary<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akiko Iwasaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus Bosenberg<\/i><\/presenter>.

To overcome these suboptimal results, different targets and combination therapies are the aim of active non-clinical and clinical research. Importantly, clinical trials of combination therapies have demonstrated better efficacy but also an increase of adverse events. HDAC6 is a member of the Zn-dependent histone deacetylase family of enzymes with peculiar structure and functions. In contrast to what is observed with many other HDAC family members, HDAC6 KO mice are viable and have no peculiar phenotype indicating that selective HDAC6 inhibitors should be well tolerated. Since HDAC6 is an obligate regulator of cytokine-induced PD-L1 expression, HDAC6 inhibitors might have a role in modulating tumor immune responses. We here report the in vivo efficacy of ITF3756, a potent and selective HDAC6 inhibitor that reduces in vitro the expression of PD-L1 on human monocytes and on CD8 T cells<i>,<\/i> counters immune exhaustion in CD8 T cells but shows no direct cytotoxic effects on a panel of murine tumor cell lines. In syngeneic tumor models ITF3756 showed anti-tumor activity that was comparable to the efficacy of an anti PD1 antibody and that went along with increased immune cell infiltration and the generation of tumor-reactive CD8 and CD4 cells. ITF3756 was inactive in immune-deficient animals and selective depletion of either CD8 or CD4 cells severely blunted the antitumor activity of ITF3756. In combination with an anti CTLA-4 antibody, ITF3756 lead to a complete tumor eradication in 50% of the animals. Re-challenge of these animals did not result in tumor growth indicating that the combination therapy had elicited tumor immunity. Blocking the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis either alone or in combination with inhibition of CTLA4 in NOD mice strongly accelerated the development of auto-immune diabetes that was lethal in some treatment groups. In contrast neither ITF3756 alone nor the combination with anti CTLA4 lead to any significant induction of diabetes despite the activity of ITF3756 on the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis. We conclude that ITF3756 induces an <i>in vivo <\/i>antitumor immune response and a durable antitumor activity when combined with an anti CTLA-4 antibody. Neither ITF3756 monotherapy nor the combination with anti CTLA4 accelerated the induction of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice suggesting a favorable safety profile that was confirmed in preclinical GLP toxicology studies. Phase I clinical trials with ITF3756 will be initiated this year.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03d6bd90-8401-45a6-8b8f-a108f5848b0d\/@t03B8ZH6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,CTLA-4,PD-L1,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14566"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gianluca Fossati<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Ripamonti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianluca Caprini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pietro Pozzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabetta Galbiati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paola Cordella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mattia Marchini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Vergani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Sandrone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Stevenazzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Steinkuhler<\/i><\/presenter>.

HDAC6 also binds ubiquitinated proteins, facilitating the formation of the aggresome, to remove misfolded proteins. Previously, HDAC6-selective inhibitors were shown to decrease immunosuppression and enhance immune function of melanoma patient T-cells demonstrating an important role for HDAC6 inhibition for cancer immunotherapy. GB-1101 is a novel, orally bioavailable, nanomolar potent inhibitor of HDAC6. GB-1101 tested in vitro did not induce direct cytotoxicity to CD4<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD8<sup>+<\/sup> or NK cells at concentrations up to 300 nM. RNA-seq on GB-1101 exposed MHC-null human MSS colon cancer cell lines reveal potent induction of MHC Class I\/II genes and expression numerous cancer neoantigens. To test the activity of GB-1101 in vivo, we established large (~450mm<sup>3<\/sup>) 4T1-luc syngeneic tumors and initiated treatment of GB-1101 given orally once daily alone and combined with anti-PD1, anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD1\/anti-CTLA4 combination. The activity of anti-PD1 in this model was minimal (TGI: 3%); GB-1101 as a single agent showed more potent anti-tumor activity (TGI: 50%) compared to anti-PD1. We observed synergistic benefit when GB-1101 was combined with anti-PD1 (Combination TGI: 78%). GB-1101 showed comparable anti-tumor activity to single agent anti-CTLA4 (TGI: 43%) but revealed significant tumor regressions of large and well-established tumors when combined with anti-CTLA4 (Combination TGI: &#62;100%). As a single agent, GB-1101 was superior to anti-PD1+anti-CTLA4 (TGI: 7%) and induced significant tumor regressions when combined with anti-PD1+anti-CTLA4 (Triple Combination TGI: &#62;100%). In the TC-1, HPV-positive syngeneic model, GB-1101 reprogrammed the tumor immune microenvironment reducing the number of M-MDSC and T<sub>Reg<\/sub> cells and increase the numbers of CD4<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and NK cells. Taken together, these data support GB-1101 as an important new targeted epigenetic immunomodulator able to revoke immune privilege to enhance the clinical activity of immune checkpoint therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/af24a0b1-cb94-4237-8992-fa39ec0bff06\/@t03B8ZH6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Immunomodulation,Tumor microenvironment,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14567"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kari Kotlarczyk<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mario Sepulveda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maggie Murray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Gonzales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Thomas Gately<\/i><\/presenter>.

A minority of patients do achieve durable disease control after autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), and we previously demonstrated the induction of profound T cell-mediated myeloma-specific immunity after SCT in preclinical models. Nonetheless, in both mice and patients, myeloma progression is associated with inhibitory receptor expression on CD8 T cells in the bone marrow (BM). Characterization of CD8 T cell exhaustion and the presence of precursor exhausted T cells (T<sub>PEX<\/sub>) has been limited to solid tumor models. Whether CD8 T cells exhibit the same trajectory of exhaustion from T<sub>PEX <\/sub>in the MM BM microenvironment after SCT was hitherto unknown. This is an important clinical question as immunotherapies are largely utilized in relapsed\/refractory MM and currently do not target this patient population. We performed single cell RNA sequencing in mice with relapsed MM after SCT to provide in-depth characterization of CD8 T cell differentiation and exhaustion. CD8 T cells were sorted via flow cytometry based on CD38 and CD101 expression to capture diverse stages of differentiation. Notably, CD38<sup>+<\/sup>CD101<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T cells have been previously described as irreversibly exhausted and represent over 50% of polyclonal CD8 T cells in our model. We performed unsupervised clustering and identified ten CD8 T cell clusters that spanned T cell differentiation, including a T<sub>PEX<\/sub> population with a phenotype akin to solid tumor settings. We also observed two distinct exhausted T cell clusters that both expressed <i>Tox<\/i>, <i>Pdcd1<\/i>, and lacked <i>Tcf7<\/i> while only one cluster expressed high levels of <i>Prdm1<\/i> (Blimp-1), <i>Havcr2 <\/i>(TIM-3), <i>Maf<\/i> and <i>Il10<\/i>. Utilizing flow cytometry, we confirmed expression of TOX and PD-1, with loss of TCF-1, in mice with relapsed MM and expression of c-Maf was largely restricted to the TIM-3<sup>+<\/sup> subset. We next sought to determine whether the exhausted clusters represented degrees of exhaustion or were distinct lineages. Thus, we performed RNA velocity analysis and noted a clear trajectory from the T<sub>PEX<\/sub> cluster towards the two exhausted clusters, confirming a common trajectory of CD8 T cell exhaustion states across solid and hematological malignancies. Surprisingly, there was a divergence point between the exhausted clusters suggesting that these could be distinct lineages. To address this, we performed bone marrow aspirates in mice from 3 weeks post-SCT to track exhaustion phenotypes over time in myeloma-bearing mice. We observed concurrent emergence of both exhausted T cell phenotypes from early post-SCT, supporting our hypothesis that these may represent distinct T cell exhaustion lineages. These data highlight a trajectory of CD8 T cell exhaustion from precursor subsets in MM that supports the utilization of immunotherapies in the early stages of disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d08e17f3-f166-4175-8a2e-25df0ff7ef81\/@t03B8ZH6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Single cell,Bone marrow,Multiple myeloma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14568"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Simone A.

However, despite the successful response in some cancer, it is still ineffective for other malignant lesions such as ovarian cancer. Studies on T cell dynamics demonstrated that antitumor immune response from ICB is mediated by clonal replacement of CD8 T cells. Moreover, the presence of clones expanded in both tumor and peripheral tissue, also called dual-expanded, can predict response to ICB. To understand T cell dynamics in ovarian cancer, we characterized intratumoral and peripheral immune cells by single-cell transcriptome and TCR-sequencing.<br \/><b>Methods and results:<\/b> Using the 5&#8217; Chromium assay (10X Genomics) on CD45+ cells isolated from 5 na&#239;ve-treatment patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery, we identified T cell states and classified clones by location (blood or tumor) and expansion pattern. In addition, the data revealed that clones expanded within the tumor were terminally exhausted (upregulation of <i>PDCD1<\/i>, <i>HAVCR2, CTLA4, ENTPD1<\/i>, and <i>CXCL13<\/i> genes), while dual-expanded clones (expanded in blood and tumor) upregulated genes associated with the cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells, such as granzymes (<i>GZMA<\/i> and <i>GZMB<\/i>) and perforin (<i>PRF1<\/i>). Considering the importance of dual-expanded clones in antitumor immune response, we interrogated the cellular interactions they encountered in the tumor microenvironment. Using the tool NicheNet we identified <i>IL21<\/i> as one of the top ligands mediating the interaction between dual-expanded clones and T follicular helper-like CD4+ cells (Tfh-like cells). Interestingly, the gene signature of Tfh-like cells showed that besides dual-expanded clones, these cells might attract other immune cells through CXCL13 and oxysterol metabolites. We identified B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) as the major cell types recruited by the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis and oxysterol-GPR183, respectively. Additionally, memory-like CD8 T cells were found to express <i>GPR183<\/i>, suggesting that a gradient of oxysterol might recruit them to a region defined by Tfh-like cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Taken together, our study provides insights into additional functions of Tfh-like cells in the recruitment of immune cells through oxysterol gradient. A better understanding of the T cell dynamics and antitumor immune response can provide potential development of novel immunotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f0022d1-6db1-4a5e-9d30-df19fe59b7be\/@u03B8ZH7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Cytotoxic T cell,scRNA-seq,lymphoid aggregates,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14569"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mayra Carneiro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paméla Thébault<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yacine Bareche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kurosh Rahimi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-François Cailhier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Marie Mes-Masson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Stagg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Petropoulos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Réjean Lapointe<\/i><\/presenter>.

One reason for this failure is thought to be T cell dysfunction or exhaustion promoted by suppressive soluble factors within the tumor microenvironment (TME). High extracellular levels of the immunosuppressive factor adenosine (Ado) are generated in the TME via breakdown of ATP by ecto-enzymes CD39 and CD73 expressed on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Binding of extracellular Ado to its receptor A2a on T cells results in inhibition of proliferation and effector function. Interestingly, CD39 has recently been described as a surrogate marker of exhaustion on human CAR-T cells and non-engineered T cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that CD39 expression on exhausted CAR-T cells promotes dysfunction through generation of extracellular adenosine.<br \/>Using an in vitro model of T cell exhaustion, whereby human T cells express a CAR that tonically signals in an antigen-independent manner (HA CAR), we demonstrate that exhausted HA CAR T cells actively hydrolyze extracellular ATP via their elevated expression of CD39 and CD73. Moreover, exhausted CD39+ CAR T cells upregulate several genes associated with a Treg phenotype at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that this cell population might be suppressive. To assess whether CD39+\/CD73+ CAR T cells exhibit suppressive functions, we co-cultured them with non-exhausted CD19-CAR T cells. Indeed, proliferation and secretion of IL-2 by CD19 CAR T cells were diminished when they were co-cultured with exhausted CD39+ CAR T cells, and that this suppression is dependent on the A2a receptor. Using this knowledge, we used gene-editing and overexpression approaches to engineer CAR-T cells with resistance to suppressive adenosine signaling. In contrast to genetic deletion of CD39 or CD73, which did not alleviate CAR T cell dysfunction, genetic deletion of adenosine receptor A2aR in exhausted CAR T cells resulted in phenotypic changes and a modest improvement in tumor-specific killing. Further, ectopic overexpression of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in CAR T cells led to decreased exhaustion marker expression and significantly enhanced effector function. These data indicate that ADA overexpression is an innovative approach to increase the functionality of CAR T cells through avoidance of suppressive adenosine signaling, and provides proof-of-concept that metabolic engineering of CAR-T cells can pave the way for responses in patients with solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/867ddede-015d-4b31-8848-2eb040f0b2b3\/@u03B8ZH7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Immunosuppression,Chimeric antigen receptor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14570"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dorota Klysz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meena Malipatlolla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Freitas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malek Bashti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louai Labanieh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cecilia Ramello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amaury Lerust<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyatt Balke Want<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaithlen Zen Pacheco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evan W.

However, post-treatment loss of CD19 has emerged as an adaptive mechanism of resistance. Pet dogs that develop tumors spontaneously in an immune competent setting represent a compelling parallel population of patients to study next generation cancer immunotherapies. Comparative trials at the University of Pennsylvania are investigating the activity of canine CAR-T cells targeting either CD19 or CD20 in canine B cell lymphoma patients and have revealed a favorable safety profile with early signs of anti-tumor activity. Aligned with experiences in human trials, expansion of CD20-negative B cells has been observed in dogs treated with anti-CD20 CAR-T cells. Bispecific CAR-T cells that simultaneously target two antigens to mitigate antigen escape have encouraging efficacy profiles in human patients. Thus, we designed a dual-targeting CAR specific for canine B cell antigens. A second-generation canine CAR construct targeting both CD19 and CD20 with a 28z signaling domain was cloned into the MSGV1 backbone. Chimeric retrovirus encoding RD114 and VSV-G envelope proteins and the CAR construct was made using GP2-293 cells. Jurkat NFAT-GFP reporter cells and primary T cells from dogs diagnosed with high grade B cell lymphoma were retrovirally transduced with bispecific CARs. Antigen specific reactivity was assessed against cell lines with variable CD19 and CD20 expression patterns. The CD19-CD20 CAR was efficiently transduced, with stable expression in both Jurkat and primary canine T cells. Jurkat reporters revealed dual-specific CAR signaling after co-culture with CD19+ and\/or CD20+ target cells. Primary canine CAR-T cells expanded <i>in vitro<\/i> and exhibited CAR-specific proliferation and cytotoxicity against CD19+ CD20+ target cells. Preclinical manufacture of functional, bispecific anti-CD19 anti-CD20 canine CAR-T cells is feasible. A clinical trial recruiting dogs diagnosed with B cell cancer will assess safety and efficacy of this approach <i>in vivo<\/i>, with the aim of establishing the dog as a compelling model to appraise the ability of bispecific CAR-T cells to overcome therapeutic failures secondary to antigen loss. <b><u><\/u><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bc814311-1ee6-4993-b09d-b9d3b942e448\/@u03B8ZH7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Animal models,Bispecific,Comparative oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14571"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew J.

The resultant TCR diversity, and subsequent clonal expansion events, are critical in understanding the adaptive immune response to pathogens and cancers. While many methods have been developed to determine specific clonotypes and overall TCR diversity present in various tissues, these methods to date have failed to capture spatial orientation and arrangement of T-cells engaging with their microenvironment. Tracking T-cell migration and infiltration into the tumor has thus been limited to post-hoc low-plex profiling methods. To better understand T-cell localization during tumor development, we have developed a TCR profiling panel for the GeoMx&#174; Digital Spatial Profiler that can be combined with the GeoMx Cancer Transcriptome Atlas (CTA) or Human Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA). This novel spatial assay enables simultaneous quantification of all functional TCR constant, variable and joining segments <i>in situ<\/i> along with transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling in spatially defined regions of a tissue. We validated the performance of the TCR probe pool in inflamed tonsil and cell pellet arrays, demonstrating comparable sensitivity and specificity relative to orthogonal methods. We next used the GeoMx TCR spike-in panel to characterize intra- and inter-patient TCR heterogeneity in a cohort of 68 T-cell lymphomas to track clonal interactions between the malignant and non-malignant immune microenvironment. We demonstrate the ability to link the spatial context of TCR segment expression to activation of malignant signaling cascades as well as non-cancerous T-cell response to the presence of other immune cells and cancer-associated signaling. Together, the combination of our TCR spike-in panel with the CTA or WTA illuminates spatial distribution of T-cell clones paving the way for studies to comprehensively link TCR clonality changes to the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY.

In our previous studies of immune responses to ICT in the mouse T3 sarcoma model, we found strong upregulation of the BHLHE40 transcription factor in a number of immune cell populations. It was particularly prominent in the tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, which are crucial for ICT-induced tumor rejection and elimination. We used global and cell-type specific <i>Bhlhe40<\/i> knockout (KO) mice to investigate its role in tumor rejection. Both global <i>Bhlhe40<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> and <i>CD4-Cre<\/i>+ <i>Bhlhe40<\/i><sup>f\/f <\/sup>(CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-specific <i>Bhlhe40<\/i> deletion) mice bearing the 1956 methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma line failed to respond to either anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 ICT, in stark contrast to wild type (WT) mice. At the same time, <i>Bhlhe40<\/i> deletion in macrophages and granulocytes (<i>LysM-Cre<\/i>+ <i>Bhlhe40<\/i><sup>f\/f<\/sup> mice) did not have an apparent effect on ICT-mediated tumor rejection. To gain insight into the functional changes orchestrated by BHLHE40 in response to ICT, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze the transcriptional profiles of the CD45+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells from 1956 tumor-bearing <i>Bhlhe40<\/i><sup>+\/+<\/sup> and <i>Bhlhe40<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice treated with control, anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 mAb. While no major changes in the relative fractions of effector T cell clusters were observed, ICT induced BHLHE40-dependent remodeling within individual CD4+ and CD8+ clusters. Most notably, <i>Bhlhe40<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice were strongly deficient in ICT-induced <i>Ifng<\/i> expression by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, with intracellular cytokine staining revealing low IFN&#947; production by both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. GSEA and Ingenuity Pathway analysis indicated changes in energy metabolism, hypoxia adaptation, NF-&#954;B signaling, IFN&#947; response, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in a number of <i>Bhlhe40<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> T cell clusters. This was accompanied by upregulation of the inhibitory receptor <i>Tigit<\/i> mRNA, altered expression of chemokine\/chemokine receptor genes, as well as granzyme gene family members. In addition to changes in the transcriptional profile shared between anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 treatments, each checkpoint inhibitor induced its own specific alterations both in WT and KO mice. Analysis of macrophage populations also revealed a notable difference between <i>Bhlhe40<\/i><sup>+\/+<\/sup> and <i>Bhlhe40<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice. The shift of macrophages from the CX3CR1<sup>+ <\/sup>CD206<sup>+<\/sup> to the iNOS<sup>+<\/sup> phenotype, typically observed during effective ICT, was dramatically reduced in the <i>Bhlhe40<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice, which was confirmed by flow cytometry. Our results provide the basis for understanding the role of BHLHE40 in the ICT-induced tumor rejection, the pathways and effector mechanisms under its control, and the potential ways for therapeutic targeting of this regulatory network to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/749bd05e-9a70-4cc2-a000-b95e530e10e9\/@u03B8ZH7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Tumor associated macrophages,Immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14573"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander S.

Here we identify self-renewing and multipotent Tscm tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in human cancer and present a novel Tscm subset which expresses CD45RO, is derived from CD45RO- Tscm T cells, and is capable of self-renewal and multipotency. From the analysis of CD45RO+ Tscm differentiation, phenotyping, gene expression, and the broader TCR repertoire, we find that CD45RO+ Tscm cells are hierarchically positioned in between canonical CD45RO- Tscm cells and central memory T cells. Notably, CD45RO+ Tscm cells exhibit a gene expression profile consistent with effector capabilities and a tumor-specific phenotype that is more similar to T cells associated with successful immunotherapy than canonical Tscm. Thus, we describe a novel Tscm subset in human cancer which has distinct phenotypic, transcriptional, and effector-like attributes that position it as an attractive subset for future basic and clinical research in the setting of cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0755e3f8-7e87-45f4-9e2c-bd331a6b0a2c\/@u03B8ZH7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Stemness,Immuno-oncology,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14574"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel J.

Hematopoietic Progenitor Kinase 1 (HPK1\/MAP4K1) is a member of the MAP4K family whose activity has been demonstrated to restrain T cell activation through phosphorylation of SLP-76 at Serine 376 leading to TCR disassembly. Mediators generated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) such as adenosine, PGE<sub>2<\/sub> and TGF&#946; can dampen T cell activity and present a significant barrier to cancer therapy. HPK1 inhibition may allow for enhanced T cell activation under such suppressive conditions. Herein, we describe studies to assess the effects of HPK1 inhibition on T cell activation and in alleviating suppression. We also test the ability of HPK1 inhibition in combination with adenosine receptor antagonism to further amplify T cell activation.<br \/>Methods: CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were isolated from human blood and RNA was isolated for qPCR analysis of MAP4K1-7 expression. Cells were activated using CD3\/28 stimulation and supernatants were assayed for IL-2, IFN&#611; and TNF&#945; using CBA. CRISPR knockout of HPK1 in CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells and reference or in-house HPK1 inhibitors used to characterize HPK1 function. We used a flow cytometry-based assay to quantify activation markers CD69 and CD25, and phospho-SLP-76 in isolated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and in human and mouse whole blood.<br \/>Results: Using publicly available gene expression databases, we identified that HPK1 is primarily expressed in immune cells, with highest expression in T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells. In-house gene expression analyses demonstrated that HPK1 is the predominant MAP4K family member in human T cells. CRISPR knockout in primary human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells was used to demonstrate that HPK1 but not MAP4K3 and MAP4K4 negatively regulates T cell activation. Consistent with this, reference and in-house HPK1 kinase inhibitors reduced phosphorylation of SLP-76 in both isolated T cells and human and mouse whole blood. In human T cells, HPK1 inhibition dose-dependently increased IL-2, IFN&#611; and TNF&#945; secretion, highlighting the negative role of HPK1 in T cell activation. Using adenosine, PGE<sub>2<\/sub> and TGF&#946;, expression of CD69 and T cell cytokine secretion is diminished. HPK1 inhibition restored T cell activation to unsuppressed levels. Consistent with these results, HPK1<sup>KO<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells displayed significant resistance to adenosine, PGE<sub>2<\/sub> and TGF&#946;-induced immunosuppression. Finally, upon suppression using adenosine, combining HPK1 inhibition with adenosine receptor antagonism further elevated T cell activation above individual inhibitor treatments alone.<br \/>Conclusion: These data demonstrate that HPK1 plays a significant role in dampening T cell activation and provide a strong therapeutic rationale for targeting HPK1 to relieve T cell immunosuppression in the TME and amplify anti-tumor immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3f5c92c9-dd24-4987-9d9e-b797a8cb04ea\/@u03B8ZH7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Immuno-oncology,Kinases,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14579"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rajesh K.
