[{"Abstract":"Leukemic blasts are immune cells gone awry. We thus hypothesized that dysregulation of inflammatory pathways can maintain a leukemic state. In contrast to traditional cancer immunotherapy, we exploited inflammatory signaling within AML blasts as cell-intrinsic, self-directed immunotherapy. Corroborating the hypothesis that AML cells depend on proper regulation of inflammatory networks, we identified an AML subgroup enriched for inflammatory pathways, associated with a monocytic lineage signature. To discover AML selective, immune-modulating vulnerabilities, we integrated data from the Cancer Dependency Map on 789 cancer cell lines with independent genome-wide screens, identifying <i>Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2<\/i> (<i>IRF2BP2<\/i>). We validated AML cell dependency on IRF2BP2 with orthogonal genetic approaches <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> and studied acute IRF2BP2 degradation. Perturbation of IRF2BP2 resulted in cell death with hallmarks of apoptosis. To decipher how IRF2BP2 relates to inflammatory signaling, we studied IRF2BP2 localization on chromatin. We found genome-wide IRF2BP2 binding in promoter and in enhancer regions. <i><\/i>Global gene expression studies following degradation of IRF2BP2 showed an increase in expression of the majority of IRF2BP2 bound genes, supporting a role for IRF2BP2 as a transcriptional repressor. Gene set enrichment analyses identified NF-&#954;B-related immune response signatures as the most significantly altered leading us to hypothesize that IRF2BP2 represses NF-&#954;B-mediated TNF&#945; signaling that, when acutely perturbed, leads to leukemia cell death. Indeed, we confirmed an activation of NF-&#954;B-signaling, an increase in nuclear RELA protein, and gain in RELA chromatin binding following degradation of IRF2BP2. Moreover, a mutant &#8220;super-repressor&#8221; allele of I&#954;B&#945; rescued the impaired cell growth upon IRF2BP2 perturbation, supporting cell death associated with IRF2BP2 loss being mediated through activation of NF-&#954;B signaling. In addition, we identified IL-1&#223; as an enhancer of the inflammatory response repressed by IRF2BP2. Using patient-derived xenograft models, we demonstrated a significant reduction in leukemia burden and an increase in median survival in mice that had received patient-derived AML cells with <i>IRF2BP2<\/i>-targeting CRISPR guides compared to control guides. Importantly, loss of <i>IRF2BP2<\/i> in normal bone marrow-derived hCD34+ cells had no effect on colony forming capacity. In summary, we demonstrate that IRF2BP2 represses IL-1&#223;\/TNF&#945; signaling via NF-&#954;B, and IRF2BP2 perturbation results in hyperinflammation leading to AML cell death. These findings elucidate a hitherto unexplored AML dependency, reveal cell-intrinsic inflammatory signaling as a mechanism priming leukemic blasts for cell death, and motivate the exploration of alternative immune-mediated therapies in cancers that have yet to reap the benefits of the immunotherapy revolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c802a61c-b3f3-4904-ba74-20a8d6a62b7f\/@y03B8ZXi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Inflammation,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jana M.

However, the life-threatening cardiovascular toxicity of many TKIs present major concerns. Ponatinib is the most effective treatment for patients harboring the common T315I mutation of BCR-ABL that drives Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) yet is one of the most cardiotoxic of TKIs. Ponatinib-induced events include myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and venous thrombosis. The aim of this study is to reengineer the chemical structure of ponatinib to minimize its adverse cardiovascular effects by using <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models of cardiovascular toxicity.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: We developed <i>in vitro<\/i> cardiovascular toxicity assays using human iPSC-cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), and assessed anti-tumor efficacy in T315I mutated K562 CML cells. The cardiotoxicity was determined by impairment of cardiomyocyte contractility function, the vascular toxicity was defined by inability to form capillary-like networks in vasculogenesis assays. <i>In vitro<\/i> screening of ponatinib analogues probed chemical moieties responsible for its cardiovascular toxicity that were confirmed using mice xenograft mice models with human T315I mutant K562 cells.<br \/>Summary of Unpublished Data: Compared to ponatinib, refined analogues showed markedly decreased adverse effects on HMVECs vasculogenesis and hiPSC-CMs contractility <i>in vitro<\/i>. The therapeutic window was increased <i>in vivo<\/i>, leading to regression of human T315I mutant CML xenografts comparable to ponatinib but without increasing serum levels of cardiac troponin. The kinase inhibition profiles of the &#8220;safe&#8221; analogues compared to ponatinib identified candidate mediators of ponatinib-induced toxicity. Validation by selective knockdown revealed likely mediators of cardiotoxicity, including FGFR.<br \/>Conclusions: We succeeded in engineering a cardiovascular safe TKI that retained effective therapeutic properties against BCR-ABL T351 mutated form of CML, but with substantially decreased cardiovascular toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cb5e9e2e-604b-472a-b178-f47a2cecdb0d\/@y03B8ZXi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cardiotoxicity,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Chronic myelogenous leukemia,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Pavlovna Hnatiuk<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arne A.

Unfortunately, most of these pts will eventually develop treatment resistance. ORCHARD is an ongoing Phase II platform study (NCT03944772) enrolling pts with EGFRm NSCLC, whose tumors progressed on 1L osimertinib, to a treatment group based on their tumor molecular profile. This exploratory analysis aimed to further understand the genomic landscape of resistance detected in tumor samples from pts with EGFRm NSCLC post-1L osimertinib, and to evaluate the concordance of resistance mechanisms identified in plasma and tissue.<br \/>Methods: Pts enrolled on ORCHARD (with advanced EGFRm NSCLC) provided tissue\/plasma samples after progression on 1L osimertinib. Samples were analyzed for resistance mechanisms and testing concordance using next generation sequencing (NGS) either centrally (tissue [Foundation Medicine]; plasma [Guardant Health]) or locally. Alterations were determined based on reported results from respective assay.<br \/>Results: In total, 195 tissue samples (21 local and 174 central NGS) and 69 plasma samples (central NGS) were collected. The 174 central tissue samples were used for the genomic profiling: MET amplification occurred in 24% (42\/174) of tumors; EGFR amplifications in 36% (62\/174). Secondary EGFR mutations (C797X, L718X) and BRAF fusions were less common, 7% (13\/174) and 5% (9\/174), respectively, while other potentially actionable genomic alterations were rare: ERBB2 amplified\/mutated (2%), ALK fusion (2%), RET fusions (1%), KRAS mutation (1%), BRAF V600E (1%).In the concordance analysis, 69 samples of matched tumor and plasma were used. Concordance was high between tissue and plasma for point mutations, particularly for sensitizing (64 samples; 89% concordance) and uncommon (G719X, L861X, S768I; 5 samples; 100% concordance) EGFR resistance mutations. The majority of EGFR (21\/38 samples) and MET (16\/30) amplifications were detected via tissue only. For BRAF, concordance was low: 4\/5 BRAF fusions were found in tissue only, 1\/5 in plasma only; 5\/5 BRAF V600E mutations could be identified in plasma but only one of these was also identified in tissue.<br \/>Conclusions: Genomic profiling of pts with disease progression after 1L osimertinib showed that the most common identifiable resistance mutations were consistent with previous studies, however MET, EGFR amplifications and BRAF fusions were identified at higher rates than expected. Tissue and plasma provided different but potentially complementary results for detecting mechanisms of resistance, with differing levels of concordance across the mutations; further study is required in this area. Further exploration of 1L osimertinib resistance is continuing in the ongoing ORCHARD study.<br \/><u><\/u>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e75ece70-4867-4c24-b5d8-06e275aca33a\/@y03B8ZXi\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,NSCLC,Osimertinib,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan J.

Recent discovery of KRAS targeted therapies (e.g. SOS1i, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>i, etc.) has dramatically changed the clinical outlook for patients with KRAS mutant tumors. Here, we generated and utilized pancreatic clonal replica tumors (CRTs) to identify drug-resistant clones of KRAS inhibitors (e.g. SOS1i and MEKi, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>i). Deep clonal characterization of KRAS inhibition revealed a novel epigenetic vulnerability which may inform on unbiased combination strategies to prolong responses for pancreatic cancer patients.<br \/>Experimental procedures: Our CRT platform combines high-complexity in vivo lineage tracing with quantitative assessments of adaptive responses to therapeutics. In this study we generated a KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>-driven CRT xenograft model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and treated the CRTs with MEKi, SOSi, and MEKi + SOSi. Upon comprehensive analysis of the clonal composition associated with each drug treatment, we identified, isolated, and validated a collection of clones with differential response to MEKi + SOS1i or KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>i. Deep molecular characterization of sensitive and resistance clones identified novel combination strategies to overcome resistance to KRAS inhibitors.<br \/>Results: We found that KRAS inhibition greatly impacted CRT clonal composition and tumor heterogeneity. Well-controlled reconstitution experiments with CRT-informed treatment-na&#239;ve clones confirmed the pre-existing nature of the differential clonal response to KRAS inhibitors in pancreatic cancer. Transcriptomic profiling of clonal diversity further revealed a BRD3-driven molecular plasticity in resistant clones that may drive resistance to MEKi + SOS1i or KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>i. Pharmacological combination of MEKi (trametinib) + SOS1i (BI-3406) or KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>i (MRTX1133) with BETi (BI 894999 and dBET6) exhibited combination benefits in preclinical pancreatic cancer models.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study suggests that pre-existing heterogeneous subclones with epigenetic plasticity contribute to escaping direct KRAS inhibition in pancreatic cancer and provides a new avenue to overcome such resistance by combining KRAS inhibitors with BET inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/47f1743b-f446-4bbd-b760-dae36b2cdb58\/@y03B8ZXi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Drug resistance,Epigenetics,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hengyu Lyu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosalba Minelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles E.

Here, we provide a step-by-step phenotypic and molecular characterization of the different processes involved during the adaptive response to osimertinib using several EGFR-mutated lung cancer models. This strategy led to the identification of a common vulnerability of drug-tolerant cells which could be efficiently and safely targeted by a clinical stage drug.<br \/>Experimental design: We used the FUCCI (fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator) system to determine the cell cycle dynamics in real time during the adaptive response to osimertinib in a panel of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cell lines. We performed scRNAseq on untreated and osimertinib-treated G1 and S\/G2 sorted cells during early relapse to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying entry and exit from dormancy. We validated our observations in several <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models as well as in publicly available patient data.<br \/>Results: FUCCI labelling allowed the identification of a rare population of S\/G2 cycling cells (referred to as early escapers) that emerged in the first hours of treatment amongst a majority of stably arrested and progressively dying G1 cells. scRNAseq data revealed that early escapers emerged from a differentiated alveolar type 1 (AT1) phenotype which was invariably associated with an increase in contractile-related gene signatures, F-actin polymerization and Rho\/ROCK pathway activation. Using a screen of Rho-pathway inhibitors, we found that tipifarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTi)<u>,<\/u> induced a complete clearance of DTC <i>in vitro<\/i>. Co-treatment with tipifarnib, a clinically active FTi, safely and durably prevented relapse to osimertinib in a PC9-xenograft model as well as in a PDX model of EGFR<sup>L858R\/T790M <\/sup>lung cancer for up to 6 months with no evidence of toxicity. Several farnesylated targets were identified in both G1 and S\/G2 treated cells, which could explain the high efficiency of tipifarnib in preventing the adaptive response to osimertinib. Finally, we observed that osimertinib + tipifarnib co-treatment completely suppressed the emergence of the AT1 phenotype, prevented mitosis of S\/G2-treated cells and increased the apoptotic response through activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data strongly support the use of tipifarnib in combination with osimertinib in the clinic to effectively, durably and safely prevent relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d4d81809-7511-4ed0-8113-47df8ada9742\/@y03B8ZXi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,Drug Tolerance,Lung cancer,Tipifarnib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sarah Figarol<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Célia Delahaye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rémi Gence<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raghda Asslan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Pagano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacques Colinge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Philippe Villemin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonio Maraver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle Lajoie-Mazenc<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Estelle Clermont<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Casanova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Pradines<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Mazières<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Olivier Calvayrac<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gilles Favre<\/i><\/presenter>.

Overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL has been found to be associated with therapeutic resistance, metastasis, and poor prognosis in endometrial cancer. Our objective was to identify whether inhibition of AXL through a novel, selective targeted agent, AVB-500, would improve sensitivity to paclitaxel. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the mechanism for this improved sensitivity was through metabolic regulation.<br \/>Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on a tissue microarray containing specimens from patients with primary and metastatic uterine serous carcinoma. Blind scoring was performed by two reviewers. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to generate time-to-event curves. Cell viability was performed with high-grade endometrial, chemo-resistant cell lines, ARK1 and PUC198. Cells were treated with paclitaxel and with AVB-500+paclitaxel. Intraperitoneal (IP) ARK1 or PUC198 tumors were treated with vehicle, AVB-500, paclitaxel, or AVB-500+paclitaxel. A Seahorse Analyzer was used for glycolytic rate assays. Isotope tracing was used for <i>in vivo<\/i> metabolite abundance quantification.<br \/>Results: We found that both GAS6 and AXL expression were higher by IHC in tumors with a poor response to chemotherapy compared to tumors with a good response to chemotherapy (GAS6: 40.9% vs. 30.4%, P=0.012; AXL: 60.7% vs. 42.7%, P=0.013). Median PFS and OS were longer in patients with low GAS6 expressing tumors compared to high GAS6 expressing tumors (PFS: 33.6 mo vs. 10.6 mo, P=0.003; OS: 39.5 mo vs. 27.7 mo, P=0.003). We showed that chemotherapy resistant endometrial cancer cell lines, ARK1 and PUC198 had improved sensitivity and synergy with paclitaxel when treated in combination with AVB-500. ARK1 and PUC198 <i>in vivo<\/i> IP models had significantly fewer tumors (ARK1: P=0.007; PUC198: P=0.029) and decreased tumor weight (ARK1: P&#60;0.001; PUC198: P=0.006) when treated with AVB-500+paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel alone. Treatment with AVB-500 + paclitaxel decreased AKT signaling which resulted in a decrease in basal glycolysis. Finally, treatment with AVB-500 + paclitaxel decreased multiple glycolytic metabolites, including fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (P=0.002), 3-phosphoglyceric acid (P=0.014), phosphoenolpyruvate (P=0.013), and lactate (P=0.024) vs. treatment with paclitaxel alone.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study provides strong pre-clinical rationale for combining AVB-500 with paclitaxel in aggressive endometrial cancer models. Additionally, continued identification of viable biomarkers is critical to the success of targeted therapies such as AVB-500. Given AXL&#8217;s role in glucose homeostasis, one or more glycolytic intermediates may prove to be a useful biomarker to help predict sensitivity in patients, thus tailoring who would benefit from this treatment combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/790cdbf2-8c0e-4939-bd2b-aaf35484e146\/@y03B8ZXi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Chemoresistance,Axl,Glycolysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shaina F.

Current clinical BRAF inhibitors selectively bind and inhibit monomeric over dimeric BRAF (i.e. &#8220;BRAF monomer-selective&#8221;) providing a high therapeutic index and are now standard practice in combination with MEK inhibitors in the treatment of patients harboring BRAF(V600E) tumors. However adaptive resistance due to RAF dimerization limits their effectiveness. Recently, RAF inhibitors that equipotently inhibit both monomeric and dimeric BRAF have been developed, but they are predicted to have lower therapeutic index due to inhibition of dimeric wild-type BRAF in normal tissues. We identified and characterized a novel class of BRAF inhibitors that preferentially bind and inhibit dimeric over monomeric BRAF(V600E) (i.e. &#8220;BRAF dimer-selective inhibitors&#8221;). Biochemical analysis using BRAF dimer-selective inhibitors revealed that the two forms of dimeric and monomeric BRAF(V600E) differ in their conformation in their active site and their strength of interaction with MEK. Further, to maximally inhibit BRAF(V600E) signaling in tumors while retaining a broad therapeutic index, we assessed the triple combination of BRAF monomer- plus BRAF dimer selective inhibitor plus a MEK inhibitor that disrupts the BRAF-MEK complex. The triple combination potently suppressed tumor growth in multiple colorectal and melanoma BRAF(V600E) cell line- and <i>in vivo<\/i> models that were resistant to the current clinical BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination. Strikingly, while the double combination treatment with the BRAF dimer-selective inhibitor and MEK inhibitor was associated with a significant gradual weight loss <i>in vivo<\/i>, the triple combination showed no weight loss or other apparent toxicities, indicating a higher Therapeutic Index. Finally, off-label use of the triple combination in patients with advanced BRAF(V600E) cancers that progressed on standard therapies achieved durable tumor control with minimal toxicities. Thus, a rationally designed combinatorial approach of conformation-selective BRAF and MEK inhibitors may be a highly effective and well tolerated therapeutic strategy for patients with BRAF(V600E) tumors. Overall, our work supports the notion that for most tumors a &#8220;3-drug&#8221; combinatorial strategy will potentially be most effective: one drug targeting MAPK signaling directly, such as a MEK inhibitor (&#8220;pathway&#8221; inhibitor), one drug targeting mutated BRAF or RAS selectively in the tumor (&#8220;therapeutic index&#8221; inhibitor, e.g. BRAF monomer-selective inhibitor, RAS(G12C) inhibitors, etc) and one drug targeting components of the feedback loop that is responsible for adaptive resistance (&#8220;feedback&#8221; inhibitor, e.g. BRAF dimer-selective inhibitors, SHP2 or SOS inhibitors, etc). Our data contribute to the development of a roadmap for the treatment of MAPK-driven tumors using drug combinations tailored to the specific driver oncoprotein.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e3e8696-aed7-4ae2-a07a-2c4c119a1e44\/@y03B8ZXi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Resistance,MEK inhibitor,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Christos Adamopoulos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tamer Ahmed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter M.

Conventional systemic therapy has limited efficacy and there are currently no FDA approved drugs for these patients with metastatic disease. Advances in molecular profiling led identification of potential therapeutic targets, and previous studies with proteomic analysis identified AXL as a potential therapeutic target in ACC. AXL, a member of the TAM tyrosine kinase receptor family has been generally associated with poor prognosis, and its overexpression and activation is implicated in conferring resistance to conventional systemic therapies in solid tumors. ADCT-601 is an antibody drug conjugate targeting human AXL carrying novel pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer cytotoxin as the payload.<br \/>Methods: The goal of this study is to determine the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of ADCT-601 in ACC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (ACCX) models with varying AXL expression determined by Western blot. ADCT-601 treated cell lines in vitro were analyzed by MTT-based cytotoxic assay and immunoblotting, and anti-tumorigenicity was assessed in two ACCX models.<br \/>Results: ADCT-601 induced a potent dose-dependent cytotoxic effect in ACC cell lines, but its cytotoxic activity was attenuated after AXL knockdown. Biochemical data indicated that ADCT-601 treatment led to DNA damage and induction of apoptotic factors accompanied by phosphorylation of gamma-H2AX. In high AXL expressing ACCX6 model, a single dose of either 0.5 or 1.0 mg\/kg ADCT-601 significantly suppressed tumor growth resulting 3\/5 partial responders (PRs) at 1mg\/kg and 2\/5 PRs at 0.5 mg\/kg, compared to the vehicle or isotype-ADC control treated mice (0\/5 PR and 1\/5 PR, respectively). ADCT-601 appears to eliminate tumor, as no evidence of recovery in tumor growth was observed during a 60-day period. In low AXL expressing ACCX9 model, ADCT-601 treatment (at either the 0.5 or 1.0 mg\/kg dose) delayed tumor growth compared to isotype-ADC control, but did not lead to durable partial responses.<br \/>Conclusion: This study demonstrated that ADCT-601 induced a potent and specific in vitro and in-vivo anti-tumor activities in AXL expressing ACC models and suggests further development of ADCT-601 in biomarker driven clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5979bcdc-4bc0-4df4-bbce-8943ad1c34d4\/@y03B8ZXi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Axl,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Adenoid cystic carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Joseph O.

One of the few treatment options for patients with advanced and metastatic TNBC is platinum-based chemotherapy, however not all tumors respond, and those that do often become refractory during the course of treatment. The cell surface receptor Neuropilin-2 (NRP2), which acts as a co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), has been shown to be both highly expressed and associated with therapeutic resistance in TNBC. NRP2 also serves as a co-receptor for semaphorins, which may play tumor-suppressor functions in breast cancer. We have previously demonstrated that ATYR2810, a highly specific humanized monoclonal antibody which effectively blocks NRP2\/VEGF signaling without disrupting NRP2\/Semaphorin 3F signaling, down-regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes such as <i>ZEB1<\/i> and sensitizes TNBC to chemotherapy both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: In this study we have further characterized the breast cancer subtypes that are most responsive to ATYR2810 treatment. Using <i>in vitro <\/i>3D colony formation assays (CFAs), we have interrogated ~15 breast cancer cell lines covering luminal, HER2+ and various TNBC subtypes, for responsiveness to ATYR2810 treatment in combination with chemotherapy. All responsive cell lines were associated with the more aggressive subtypes of TNBC such as BL2 (basal-like 2), ML (mesenchymal-like) and MSL (mesenchymal-stem like) subtypes. Additionally, we screened five patient derived xenografts (PDXs) and again found that the responsive PDXs were associated with the more aggressive and chemoresistant subtypes of TNBC. To gain insight into the potential mechanism for enhanced chemosensitivity by ATYR2810 treatment, we performed RNAseq on the PDX tumors. Interestingly, the chemokine receptor <i>CXCR4<\/i>,<i> <\/i>which is known to promote drug resistance and tumorigenic potential, was found to be significantly downregulated in responder PDX tumors treated with ATYR2810 in combination with cisplatin as compared to those treated with cisplatin alone. Further, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that <i>CXCR4<\/i> was found in numerous downregulated pathways enriched in the PDX responder tumors treated with ATYR2810\/cisplatin, suggesting that <i>CXCR4<\/i> may be driving the responder phenotype of the PDXs. Flow cytometry analysis of TNBC cells treated with ATYR2810 monotherapy <i>in vitro<\/i> resulted in a reduced frequency of cells expressing <i>CXCR4<\/i>. Furthermore, ATYR2810 monotherapy inhibited spontaneous lung metastasis in experimental models of mesenchymal TNBC.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, our data suggest that ATYR2810 enhances chemosensitivity in highly aggressive TNBC subtypes, and that this response may be mediated through the downregulation of genes known to be associated with aggressive cancer states such as <i>ZEB1<\/i> and <i>CXCR4<\/i>. ATYR2810 may therefore serve as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of advanced and metastatic TNBC and potentially other aggressive cancer types.<br \/>Zhiwen Xu and Alison Barber are co-first authors of this abstract.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/460610e0-b8f3-4711-ac0f-3c0ac53c59ca\/@z03B8ZXj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Anti-Neuropilin,Chemosensitization,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhiwen Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alison Barber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Burkart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hira Lal Goel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Rahman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristina Hamel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary Fogassy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Eide<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clara Polizzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jasmine Stamps<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofia Klopp Savino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luke Burman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Esther Chong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne Paz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arthur M.

JNJ-70218902 (JNJ-902) is a bispecific antibody that engages TMEFF2-expressing tumor cells and CD3 on T cells causing exposure dependent pro-inflammatory responses and target tumor cell lysis. Here we report the preclinical characterization of JNJ-902 using <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> prostate cancer models. Expression of TMEFF2 transcript and protein in brain and prostate was confirmed in healthy human tissue, as was its elevated expression in advanced prostate cancer tumors, including in 41\/45 (91%) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) samples. JNJ-902 bound to TMEFF2-positive LNCaP-AR cells (androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line) in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 9.6 nM); no binding to TMEFF2-negative DU145 prostate cancer cells was observed. The binding affinity (KD) of JNJ-902 for CD3 on primary human T cells was determined to be ~151 nM. T cell-mediated killing, as measured by caspase-3 activity, was induced upon incubation of JNJ-902 with healthy human donor T cells (n = 5) and LNCaP-AR cells at a 3:1 effector to target ratio (EC50 = 1.4 nM). No cytotoxicity was detected using DU145 cells or with control antibodies. Corresponding T cell activation was confirmed by concentration-dependent increases in cell surface CD8+CD25+ expression and proinflammatory cytokine production (eg, GM-CSF, IFN-&#947;, IL-10, TNF-&#945;). Antitumor activity of JNJ-902 at increasing concentrations up to 5 mg\/kg was observed in T cell humanized NSG mice bearing LNCaP xenografts (tumor growth inhibition [&#8710;%TGI] of 75-122%) and in LuCaP 86.2 patient-derived xenografts (&#8710;%TGI of 72-88%) as compared with control-treated mice. JNJ-902-dependent intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells was detected in both models with increases in frequency of CD8+granzymeB+ effector cells. The data summarized here are the first report on the pharmacological activity of a novel TMEFF2 &#215; CD3 bispecific antibody, supporting further investigation of TMEFF2 in mCRPC given its expression in advanced prostate cancer. Targeting TMEFF2 with the TMEFF2 &#215; CD3 bispecific antibody JNJ-902 elicited robust T cell-mediated responses in both prostate cancer cells and xenograft models. Based on these data, a phase 1 dose escalation trial of JNJ-902 in patients with mCRPC is currently ongoing (NCT04397276).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/440d3b54-4165-47f5-89b2-a287db084587\/@z03B8ZXj\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,T cell redirection,Prostate cancer,TMEFF2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Subhasree Basu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mike Russell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katrin Sproesser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bethany Mattson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cassandra L.

HER3 mRNA levels are higher in ER<sup>+<\/sup> breast tumors than in other molecular subtypes. Inhibition of ER activity using an antagonist increased HER3 protein expression and activation, which was essential for growth and survival of ER<sup>+<\/sup> BC cells resistant to the ER antagonist. Therefore, therapeutically targeting HER3 with HER3-DXd, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a fully human anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody (patritumab) conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload (an exatecan derivative) via a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker, can be an effective treatment for tamoxifen-resistant (TMR) ER<sup>+<\/sup> BC. After first assessing HER3-DXd as a single agent, we sought to identify a synergistic partner to maximize HER3-DXd&#8217;s antitumor activity in HER3<sup>+<\/sup>\/ER<sup>+<\/sup> TMR BC.<br \/>Methods: Whole-genome high-throughput siRNA screening was performed to identify targets whose inhibition enhances HER3-DXd&#8217;s antitumor efficacy. The antitumor effects of HER3-DXd plus the synergistic partners were assessed using a soft agar colony formation assay and a clonogenic assay in TMR HER3<sup>+<\/sup>\/ER<sup>+<\/sup> MCF7 and T47D BC cells. Treatment effects on cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and expression of proteins that regulate cell cycle progression were assessed by flow cytometry, annexin V-PE and 7-AAD staining, and Western blotting, respectively.<br \/>Results: HER3-DXd inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of HER3<sup>+<\/sup>\/ER<sup>+<\/sup> cells by &#62;50% at 5 nM and their colony formation at 5-25 nM (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). To maximize HER3-DXd&#8217;s antitumor efficacy, we performed high-throughput siRNA screening and identified ATR, CD247, RAB7A, UPK3A, ROCK2, SLC29A1, and WNT7A as potential synergistic targets. Among these targets, inhibiting ATR with siRNA or BAY1895344 showed the most synergistic effect with HER3-DXd in HER3<sup>+<\/sup>\/ER<sup>+<\/sup> BC<sup> <\/sup>cells. In contrast, no synergistic effect was observed with the combination of BAY1895344 plus patritumab or control ADC (IgG-DXd), suggesting its dependence on HER3-DXd-mediated delivery of DXd. The combination of HER3-DXd plus BAY1895344 reprogrammed cell cycle progression from G2\/M arrest to G1 arrest by inhibiting both ATR\/Chk1\/cyclin A2\/CDK2 and ATR\/Chk1\/cyclin E\/CDK2 signaling. The combination also reduced expression of H2AX, an ATR substrate that contributes to DNA repair, but increased that of &#947;H2AX, indicating the induction of DNA damage. HER3-DXd and BAY1895344 synergistically inhibited growth of HER3<sup>+<\/sup>\/ER<sup>+<\/sup> BC cells by inducing apoptosis.<br \/>Conclusion: The combination of HER3-DXd plus ATR inhibitors has therapeutic potential for overcoming tamoxifen resistance in HER3<sup>+<\/sup>\/ER<sup>+<\/sup> BC. We are currently validating the synergy in endocrine-resistant ER<sup>+<\/sup> BC xenograft models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/00e6aa23-9d10-4e87-8ccb-a42cf311a64a\/@z03B8ZXj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Tamoxifen resistance,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xuemei Xie<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jangsoon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jon A.

In some cancers, including the majority of endometrial carcinomas, these lesions coexist and cause synergistic hyperactivation of pathway output, particularly mTORC1 kinase signaling. Although this suggests that PI3K signaling is a driver of these endometrial cancers, standard inhibitors have had only marginal activity in patients with advanced disease. We here show that, in experimental isogenic models and PDX models with PI3K and PTEN alterations, PI3K inhibitors and rapalogs are weak inhibitors of TORC1 targets and slow but do not suppress the <i>in vivo<\/i> growth of these tumors. Revolution Medicines has developed a series of bi-steric selective and potent mTORC1 inhibitors that inhibit the phosphorylation of 4EBP-1, S6K and other mTORC1 substrates at concentrations that do not affect TORC2 substrates and thus do not induce the hyperglycemia caused by downregulation of AKT signaling by pan-mTOR kinase inhibitors. We have explored the biologic and anti-tumor effects of these inhibitors in models of endometrial cancer with coexistent PI3K mutation and PTEN inactivation. The mTORC1 kinase selective bi-steric inhibitor RMC-6272 can potently suppress both mTORC1 activity and the growth of these tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Moreover, in contrast to PI3K inhibition, RMC-6272 effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of mTORC1 kinase substrates and completely suppressed the growth <i>in vivo<\/i> of multiple PDXs with this genotype without inducing hyperglycemia or causing weight loss in the mice. The results suggest that dysregulation of TORC1 activity is an important driver of endometrial carcinomas with coexistent PTEN inactivation and PI3K mutations and that selective TORC1 kinase inhibitors may prove to be useful therapeutics in this context. The bi-steric mTORC1 kinase inhibitor RMC-5552 is the first clinical candidate of this class and clinical testing is ongoing (NCT04774952).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5fc0c87a-7e03-4658-a710-b39228c5d96b\/@z03B8ZXj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Pharmacogenetics and therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,PI3K,PTEN,mTOR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hilla Solomon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Radha Mukherjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>HuiYong Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa De Stanchina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Britta Weigelt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alison M.

The highest of AML deaths in the US alone is among older patients at ages &#8805; 65 emphasizing the need for better therapeutics. The older patients have more limited curative options available due to their inability to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy. Identifying ways to boost immunotherapy responses could change the paradigm of AML, a disease still difficult to treat despite several approved targeted immunotherapeutic. The development of effective small molecules would be significant since small molecules not only target immunosuppressive mechanisms like mAbs but can stimulate intracellular pathways where antibodies are unable to permeate. In addition, small molecules can provide optimal pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for oral administration, amenable clinical dosing, and can induce relatively acute antitumor efficacy to avoid systemic immunogenicity, thus providing a superior therapeutic potential. The highly proliferative nature of tumor cells, along with infiltration of myeloid cells into the AML leads to depletion of nutrients such as functional\/natural amino acids. A key meditator of this nutrient stress pathway, the cytoplasmic GCN2 (EIF2AK4) kinase, switches on reduction of amino acids, and this activity results in T-cell inactivation, T-cell death, regulatory T-cell expansion, and the potentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We have discovered a series of novel small molecule immunotherapeutic agents (HCI-1046) that reversibly bind to GCN2 kinase,<sup> <\/sup>competitively block the ATP site, and elicit responses in AML patient samples and cell lines.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: GCN2 cell-free kinase binding, EIF2&#945; family selectivity, p<i>GCN<\/i>2 inhibition assays were performed and confirmed its on-target efficacy and potency of lead inhibitor HCI-1046. Additional experiments were conducted including CellTiterGlo, IncuCyte Live Cell Imaging, FACS Flow Cytometry, Cytotoxicity, Western Blot, ELISpot, and ELISA assays.<br \/>Results and Summary: GCN2 cell-free kinase binding, kinome selectivity, <i>p<\/i>GCN2, <i>p<\/i>EIF2&#945;, ATF4 inhibition data confirmed on-target activities of our lead GCN2 inhibitor HCI-1046. HCI-1046 demonstrated potent activity, with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 36 nM in inhibiting GCN2 kinase, and exhibited cellular efficacy with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.1 to 0.5 &#956;M range. Our preliminary results support the hypothesis that the inhibition of GCN2 reinstates anti-tumor immunity and blocks tumor progression in the AML cancer model <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our <i>in vivo<\/i> PK studies on HCI-1046 in rodent species showed excellent PK properties with 55% oral bioavailability, low clearance, and &#62;5.0-hour half-life. Thus, HCI-1046 is nominated as a pre-clinical agent. Additional data regarding the evaluation of the effects of HCI-1046 on the MDSC-suppressive function on T-cells using ELISpot, ELISA assays in AML patient samples, and other mouse model efficacy studies results will be discussed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e9de2d7d-d9ea-4f27-b8bf-8447e22f14cb\/@z03B8ZXj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Lead optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,Acute myeloid leukemia,Immuno-oncology,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zhaoliang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Medley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongqing Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Coffman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tony Pomicter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Lum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David J.
