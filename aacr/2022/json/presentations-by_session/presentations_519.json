[{"Abstract":"Childhood cancer is a leading cause of death by disease in children from 5 -14 ages, for whom there are no prevention strategies. Due to early-age of diagnosis and short-time environmental factors exposition, increasing evidence suggests childhood cancer could have stronger association with germline alterations in predisposition cancer genes. It has been estimated that up to 30% all childhood cancer diagnosis may be caused by germline variants, but their frequency and distribution remain unclear. Elucidating the prevalence and role of germline mutations in the development of childhood cancer is crucial for understanding its bases, causes, cancer-risk reduction plan, surveillance, and treatment. Here, we present a pilot study on cancer children&#8217;s patients and their relatives. A total of 40 Mexican-mestizo children with any cancer diagnosis were recruited from several Institutions of Health in Mexico and a sample of saliva or blood was obtained. Whole Exome Sequencing was performed and bioinformatic analysis was carried out following GATK best practices for germline genetic variants. Additionally, we evaluated a risk selection tool for recognition of genetic predisposition in pediatric cancer patients. Pathogenic or likely-pathogenic genetic variants (mutations) were identified from the application of a filtering chain based on ACMG guidelines, and they were subsequently validated by Sanger sequencing. Germline mutations in MSH6, NF1, MUTYH, CDKN2A, CHEK2, DICER1, FANCA and SBDS genes were identified in 5\/40 (12.5%) patients with cancer, only 3 of 5 index cases (60%) reported family history of cancer and all patients meet at least one criterion of the risk selection tool. Two patients were carriers of one mutation, while in three patients were identified 2 pathogenic variants. Additionally, we identified four nonsense candidate genetic variants on EWSR1, FANCL, EPCAM and HRAS genes and two pathogenic variants in non-cancer predisposition gene, ABCA4. Our results show for the first time a higher frequency (12.5%) of germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes in Mexican-mestizo children with cancer. The lack of family history in two carriers showed the need to establish standardized suspicion criteria for identification of children with higher risk of cancer who can benefitfrom genetic testing. Further characterization of additional genetic variants identified without clinical classification will be important to evaluate their real contribution, as well as the influence of environmental factors on <i>de novo<\/i> mutation promotion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd5e2e5d-c560-4067-b97f-68f3613f572b\/@w03B8ZQh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Hereditary cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17497"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"7792bd5c-381e-4b71-9b15-bd41f7872e6b","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7792bd5c-381e-4b71-9b15-bd41f7872e6b\/@w03B8ZQh\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Oscar Alonso Luna<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge Meléndez Zajgla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta Zapata Tarres<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Enrique Juárez Villegas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elvia Cristina Mendoza Caamal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elianeth Rey Helo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Socorro Aida Borges Yanez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriela Elisa Mercado Celis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodrigo Barquera Lozano<\/i><\/presenter>.

BWSp has a heterogeneous clinical presentation and is caused by epigenetic changes at two regions on chromosome 11p15. These epigenetic changes occur post-zygotically leading to a mosaic distribution among tissues. Clinical molecular testing usually starts with blood; however, we and others have demonstrated that positive molecular testing rates are increased if testing is performed on affected tissues. Clinical and molecular diagnosis is important because patients with BWS are at risk for development of embryonal tumors (Wilms tumor (WT), hepatoblastoma (HB), and neuroendocrine tumors). Formal surveillance guidelines were published in 2017 as part of a United States-based cancer predisposition effort that recommended alpha fetoprotein and complete abdominal ultrasound screening for all patients with BWSp until 4 years of age for HB and renal ultrasound screening until 7 years of age for WT. In contrast, the European-based BWS international consensus group (BWS-ICG) applied stratified cancer screening recommendations based on (epi)genotype. In the present study, we investigated cancer development rates and epigenotype profiles associated with cancer in patients diagnosed with BWSp. We present a series of patients with history of WT, HB, and\/or neuroendocrine tumors to highlight that there can be differing BWSp epigenotype profiles in tumor and adjacent normal tissue compared to blood, demonstrating the presence of multiple cell populations with distinct epigenetic changes within patients. These distinct changes show that more than one epigenetic alteration in the chromosome 11p15 region can be present in a single tissue type. These findings suggest that the epigenetic classification in blood alone should not be used to stratify cancer risk in BWSp. Additionally, the mild BWSp clinical phenotype and low BWS-ICG clinical scores for these patients highlight that some patients present with few external features. Therefore, neither blood epigenotype nor external phenotype can help inform an individual&#8217;s unique tumor risk. This work further suggests that the BWS-ICG tumor risk stratification system cannot be applied to the full Beckwith-Wiedemann Spectrum due to the emerging epigenetic and phenotypic landscape of patients diagnosed with BWSp. These results support a recommendation of universal tumor screening for all patients diagnosed with even mild BWSp phenotypes and\/or a 11p15 epigenetic abnormality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a81880d-02a5-480a-9252-0567e963995c\/@w03B8ZQh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Cancer risk,Wilms' tumor,Hepatoblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17498"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kelly A.

Pediatric low grade gliomas (pLGGs) are the most common pediatric brain tumors, with the most frequent driving alterations (KIAA:BRAF fusion, BRAF V600E mutation) occurring in the MAPK pathway.<br \/>To investigate the anti-tumoral activity of ulixertinib in pLGG, cell lines recapitulating both main MAPK alterations were used: DKFZ-BT66 (pilocytic astrocytoma; KIAA:BRAF fusion) and BT40 (pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma; BRAF V600E mutation and CDKN2A\/B deletion). The potential synergism of combinations with MEK inhibitors, senolytics, and chemotherapy was investigated <i>in vitro<\/i> using metabolic activity and MAPK activity assays. The most promising combinations were validated <i>in vitro<\/i> by analysis of viable, dead, and apoptotic cells through high-content microscopy. The most clinically relevant combinations were further validated <i>in vivo<\/i>: 1) in two zebrafish embryo models (respectively, BT40 and DKFZ-BT66 yolk sac injection) and 2) in NSG mice (BT40 orthotopic PDX) including <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacokinetic and -dynamic analyses.<br \/>Our data demonstrate ulixertinib&#8217;s ability to inhibit MAPK pathway activity in all used models. Ulixertinib treatment reduced cell viability in the BRAF V600E mutated cell line at a remarkably low concentration of 62.7 nM (compared to other cell lines&#8217; IC50 from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database). <i>In vivo<\/i> pharmacokinetic and -dynamic analyses showed good penetrance of the drug into mouse brain tissue, with concentrations above the<i> in vitro <\/i>IC50 and reduction of MAPK activity as assessed by Western blot. Furthermore, ulixertinib treatment slowed tumor growth and significantly increased survival in NSG mice with orthotopic BT40 xenografts.<br \/>Ulixertinib showed indications for anti-proliferative synergy <i>in vitro<\/i>, according to the Loewe and Bliss independence models, in combination with MEK inhibitors (trametinib, binimetinib) or senolytics (navitoclax, A1331852). Combinations with chemotherapy (carboplatin, vinblastine) were at most additive. Indications for synergy with binimetinib and navitoclax were confirmed in the<i> <\/i>zebrafish embryo xenograft models for both MAPK-altered backgrounds. The combination of ulixertinib with navitoclax was further investigated in the BT40 PDX mouse model, where tumor growth and survival were comparable to ulixertinib monotherapy.<br \/>In conclusion, our data indicate a strong potential for ulixertinib as a clinically relevant therapeutic option for the treatment of pLGG to be further investigated in upcoming clinical trials. Potential synergism with MEK inhibitors and senolytics was noted and warrants further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0139ffdd-539c-4979-92de-b7a2af6646fb\/@w03B8ZQh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Preclinical testing,ERK inhibitor,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Synergism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17499"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Romain Sigaud<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Rösch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlotte Gatzweiler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Benzel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Von Soosten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heike Peterziel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Najafi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simay Ayhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nina Hofmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathrin I.

Biomarkers associated with poor outcomes in cHL include PD-L1 overexpression and presence of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In the phase 2 CheckMate 744 study (NCT02927769), CAYA with R\/R cHL treated with a risk-adapted approach using nivo + BV induction showed a CMR rate per BICR of 59% (26\/44) in the standard risk cohort; 41% of patients (pts) did not achieve CMR (non-CMR). Here we compared biomarker data from pts achieving CMR vs non-CMR.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pts aged 5-30 y with R\/R cHL received 4 cycles of nivo + BV induction. Tumor biopsy and peripheral blood samples were collected at baseline (BL) and 4 prespecified timepoints during induction. CD163+ CD68+ TAMs were quantified using multiplex immunohistochemistry. Cytokine expression in pts with CMR vs non-CMR was assessed by the limma workflow and a linear model based on changes from BL. Immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Statistical testing was adjusted for repeated measures across visits; values are reported from 39\/39 cytokines and 13\/16 cell subsets tested. Cytokine ratios to BL were compared across all timepoints and between response groups by ANOVA.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Pts with CMR (n = 24\/26) after nivo + BV induction had more CD163+ CD68+ TAMs than pts with non-CMR (n = 17\/18) in the BL tumor microenvironment (<i>P <\/i>= 0.018). Hierarchical clustering of cytokine fold changes from BL to the indicated timepoint, between pts with CMR vs non-CMR, showed reduced levels of haptoglobin, RANTES, CRP, PARC, EN-RAGE, and TARC\/CCL17, and increased levels of MCP-2, IFN-&#947;, IP-10, and MIG. In all pts, median concentrations of TARC, IL-2R&#945;, CRP, and ICAM-1 decreased significantly (all <i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.05); a greater reduction in TARC and CRP was observed in early cycles in pts with CMR vs non-CMR. In contrast, IP-10 levels increased from BL in all pts (<i>P <\/i>= 0.0012). Four cytokines showed higher concentrations in pts with CMR vs non-CMR: TNFR2, MCP-2, vWF , and TIMP-1 (all <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05). Increased numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes and decreased numbers of granulocytes were observed after induction in all pts (all <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01). Pts with non-CMR had more naive (CCR7+ CD45RA+) CD4, and naive CD8 T cells than pts with CMR at BL, and more overall CD4 (CD3+ CD4+) T cells at the end of cycle 4 (all <i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This biomarker analysis from CheckMate 744 suggests that different immunological parameters are associated with CMR vs non-CMR to nivo + BV induction in CAYA with R\/R cHL. These include increased TAMs at BL in pts with CMR, changes in cytokine levels associated with macrophage biology, and greater numbers of naive lymphocytes and CD4 T cells in pts with non-CMR. TAMs have been reported to express high PD-L1 levels; thus, increased TAM numbers may sensitize pts to nivo + BV.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4d5d95ac-cd47-424f-a27c-1fe593e1ebe6\/@w03B8ZQh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Biomarkers,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18458"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"615b4f87-890f-407e-8498-99ede2dc378f","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/615b4f87-890f-407e-8498-99ede2dc378f\/@w03B8ZQh\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Charlie Garnett-Benson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ron Ammar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Russell Crowe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Francis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sahar Ansari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alev Akyol<\/i><\/presenter>.

Additionally, the impact of race\/ethnicity on pediatric cancer incidence by urban\/rural status has not been evaluated, which could inform our understanding of the roles of shared genetic and environmental causes of these malignancies.<br \/>Methods: Using SEER18, we calculated pediatric cancer incidences for individuals diagnosed 2000-2018 by residence (urban\/rural). Next we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRR) to evaluate the role of race\/ethnicity on incidence stratified by urban vs. rural status.<br \/>Results: See Table. Overall, most incidences were similar by residence, i.e., lower or equal in rural versus urban areas, except the rural group having significantly lower incidences of leukemias and germ cell tumors (GCTs). Additionally, the incidence of most pediatric cancers was consistently higher among NHW in both urban and rural areas. Yet, incidence of some cancers differed by urban\/rural residence within race\/ethnicity: retinoblastoma (NHB, Hispanic, and API); soft tissue sarcomas (NHB and AI\/AN); hepatic tumors (AI\/AN); and GCTs (API).<br \/>Conclusions: In general, Hispanic, NHB, and AI\/AN populations have similar incidence of pediatric cancers in urban or rural areas. These groups have some shared bio-geographical ancestry, suggesting a possible effect of genetics on risk. Further, differences in incidence by urban\/rural residence within race\/ethnicity suggest a possible role of environment for some cancers. Interestingly, for GCTs, NHB had a lower IRR in urban and rural areas, but Hispanic populations had a significantly higher IRR. This finding, consistent with a recent study in adults, suggest that African ancestry may confer a protective effect on risk of GCTs. Further, the GCT effect sizes were more protective in the rural group for each race\/ethnicity group, suggesting the possible role of environmental factors and interactions of environment with ancestry.<br \/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d9214b6-ab4f-4541-854f-13c053e0375b\/@w03B8ZQh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Genetic susceptibility,Epidemiology,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18459"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Priya B.

PROFYLE has united an interdisciplinary team of experts, leaders, research team, end-users and advocates from across Canada to form 14 domain specific nodes unified by a shared governance structure. PROFYLE includes genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of paired germline\/cancer fresh\/frozen samples. Inclusion criteria: &#8804;29y; treatment at a Canadian center; diagnosis of a hard-to-cure cancer. Profiling results are reviewed by multidisciplinary Molecular Tumor Boards. A report including a results\/recommendations summary of actionable findings (therapeutic, diagnostic, prognostic, cancer predisposition), potential targeted therapy options including available clinical trials, clarification of diagnosis, and genetic counseling recommendations is provided to the treating oncologist.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>To date, &#62;900 CAYA are enrolled.

Previously, we have identified high activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 through immunohistochemistry of 18 primary human AT\/RT. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway drives tumorigenicity by promoting cancer cell growth and survival. Paxalisib is a highly brain-penetrant PI3K inhibitor acting upstream of mTORC1\/2 to fully inhibit the activation of both complexes. Ongoing pediatric clinical trials have reported Paxalisib as safe and well-tolerated, with minimal dose limiting toxicities. Paxalisib treatment in mice bearing orthotopic xenografts of AT\/RT slowed tumor growth and significantly extended survival from 40 to 54 days (bioluminescent imaging, log rank test p=0.0011). However, due to limited durability of single agent therapy, we conducted pilot studies to identify rational combination therapies to enhance Paxalisib survival benefits in AT\/RT. RG2833 is a novel, highly brain penetrant, histone deacetylase 1\/3 (HDAC1\/3) inhibitor. Our preliminary data has shown that Paxalisib and RG2833 combine synergistically to decrease AT\/RT cell growth (SynergyFinder ZIP score 11.1; CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay, p&#60;0.0001), and increase apoptosis (Western blot cPARP, MUSE Annexin V Assay, ANOVA p&#60;0.001) compared to each agent alone and DMSO control. Additionally, our pilot combination study in orthotopic xenograft models of AT\/RT demonstrated that combination therapy slows tumor growth more significantly than each agent alone and vehicle control (bioluminescent imaging). This novel combination therapy will readily translate into a new clinical trial aimed at improving survival in this deadly pediatric brain tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/685f50da-b062-4ca3-9332-c4449d478626\/@w03B8ZQh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,HDAC inhibitor,Pediatric cancers,ATRT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18461"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tyler Findlay<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Malebranche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Eberhart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Raabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Rubens<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have previously identified strong activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (mTOR) signaling pathways in AT\/RT. Paxalisib is a highly brain-penetrant PI3K inhibitor acting upstream of mTOR. We find that Paxalisib slows tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft models of AT\/RT and extends median survival from 40 to 54 days (p=0.001, log-rank test).

Radiation, the standard of care, extends life for 6-18 months but has never cured a patient. Therefore, the discovery of novel treatments is imperative. DIPG tumors have elevated baseline activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), an evolutionarily conserved system that allows cells to tolerate various forms of stress. Increased expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) indicates activation of the ISR. Low levels of ATF4 protect cells from stress, while sustained high-levels of ATF4 result in cell death. Because DIPG has a high baseline level of ATF4, we hypothesized that the ISR activators Sal003 and ONC201 would synergize and kill DIPG cells. After determining the IC25 of Sal003 and ONC201, we treated three patient-derived cell lines: JHH-DIPG1, SF-7761, and JHH-DIPG16A with low micromolar doses. To measure proliferation, we performed immunofluorescence staining for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. The combination treatment significantly reduced BrdU incorporation (JHH-DIPG1 p=0.0026, SF-7761 p=0.0002, JHH-DIPG16A p&#60;0.0001 by ANOVA and Dunnett&#8217;s multiple comparisons test compared to DMSO control). In all three cell lines, the combination also significantly reduced proliferation compared to monotherapy. We next measured apoptosis by staining for cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) and performing western blots for cleaved PARP. The combination of Sal003 and ONC201 significantly increased apoptosis as measured by CC3 immunofluorescence in comparison to DMSO (JHH-DIPG1 p&#60;0.0001, SF-7761 p&#60;0.0001, JHH-DIPG16A p&#60;0.0001 by ANOVA and Dunnett&#8217;s multiple comparisons test compared to DMSO control). In all cell lines, combination therapy significantly increased CC3 positivity compared to single treatment. Western blots for cleaved PARP expression detected induction of apoptosis in all three cell lines treated with the combination over DMSO and monotherapy treated cells. In JHH-DIPG1 and SF-7761, the combination increased ATF4 expression. Since Sal003 is not yet available for clinical testing in humans, we will next investigate treatment with ONC201 and the well-tolerated ATF4 inducer fenretinide. The combination of ONC201 with another ISR activating agent has the potential to serve as a therapy for DIPG.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7cc3a031-a563-40c0-bcda-38a3a88116bb\/@x03B8ZQi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Stress response,Epigenetics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18463"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Orlandi V.

Here we demonstrate that mRNA encoding <i>CD22<\/i> undergoes aberrant splicing in B-ALL. We describe the plasma-membrane-bound CD22 &#916;ex5-6 splice isoform resistant to CAR-T cells targeting the third immunoglobulin-like domain of CD22. We also describe splice variants skipping the AUG-containing exon 2 and failing to produce any identifiable protein; therefore, this event is rate-limiting for epitope presentation. Indeed, forcing exon 2 skipping with Morpholino oligonucleotides reduced CD22 protein expression and conferred resistance to the CD22-directed antibody-drug conjugate inotuzumab <i>in vitro<\/i>. Furthermore, among inotuzumab-treated pediatric B-ALL patients, we identified one non-responder in whose blasts &#916;ex2 isoforms comprised the majority of <i>CD22<\/i> transcripts. In a second patient, a sharp reduction in CD22 protein levels during relapse was driven entirely by increased <i>CD22<\/i> exon 2 skipping. Thus, dysregulated <i>CD22<\/i> splicing is a major mechanism of epitope downregulation and ensuing resistance to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8437c001-2b2b-4a17-8171-c576f906c89b\/@x03B8ZQi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Immunotherapy,Resistance,Splice variants,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20597"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sisi Zheng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabeth Gillespie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ammar S.
