[{"Abstract":"<b>Purpose: <\/b>Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is a highly chemoresistant and aggressive breast cancer variant with limited therapeutic options. Most MpBCs harbor a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) phenotype, yet have a worse prognosis compared to TNBC. We and others discovered two key molecular alterations in MpBC associated with poor overall survival: 1) hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway and 2) enhanced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) signaling. Nitric oxide produced from iNOS is able to activate various oncogenic pathways, such as PI3K signaling. In MpBC, both PI3K and NOS signaling pathways may synergistically work to enhance chemoresistance. We propose to evaluate whether pan-NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA) augments the efficacy of alpha isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor alpelisib in MpBC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>MpBC cell lines (Hs578T, BT549, SUM159) and MpBC Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) models were used in this study. Cell viability was determined with SRB Assay and the combination index was evaluated using Chou-Talalay Method. Flow cytometry was conducted to evaluate cellular apoptosis and cell cycle distribution analysis. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy of NOS and PI3K inhibition was assessed using MpBC PDX models. Transcriptional analysis of PDX tumors treated with vehicle control, single-agent (L-NMMA or alpelisib), or combination therapy (L-NMMA+alpelisib) was conducted to reveal top enriched pathways. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses of treated MpBC cell lines and PDX tissues were performed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Combination of L-NMMA and alpelisib synergistically reduced cellular proliferation (CI&#60;1), enhanced apoptosis, depleted nucleotide pools, and arrested MpBC cell lines in G2\/M phase of cell cycle relative to single-agent treatment. Furthermore, NOS+PI3K inhibition significantly suppressed tumor volume in MpBC PDX models with <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations, although less significantly in MpBC <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-wild type PDX models, augmented efficacy of taxane chemotherapy, and improved overall survival. Transcriptional analysis of MpBC PDX tumors treated with combination therapy versus vehicle control revealed that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, DNA repair, and E2F targets were among the top enriched pathways, suggesting their plausible involvement in the mechanism of response. Immunoblotting\/immunofluorescence analyses of cell lines\/PDX models confirmed that combination therapy enhances DNA damage, reduces expression of homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair proteins, and induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, rendering MpBC cells potentially more chemosensitive.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Combined NOS and PI3K inhibition is a novel therapeutic strategy that may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with MpBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b7502d8f-6283-432b-986f-9355df4777ef\/@B03B8ZDm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"iNOS,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15077"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tejaswini P.

TTFields therapy is currently approved for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), recurrent GBM, or unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. Investigations are ongoing in additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although TTFields have been demonstrated to extend life, most patients will eventually progress. The current research aimed to identify molecular mechanisms involved in reduced cancer cellular sensitivity to TTFields, and the potential of targeting these pathways to re-sensitize the cells to TTFields.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Continuous long-term application of TTFields (7 or 13 days, depending on the cell line) generated cancer cells with reduced sensitivity to TTFields. Luminex multiplex assay was used to detect changes in signaling pathways in ovarian A2780 and GBM U-87 MG cells, and relevant pathway markers were validated by Western blot. Further validation was performed by immunohistochemistry of tumor sections from N1S1 HCC tumor-bearing rats treated with sham or TTFields. The significance of the identified pathways in reducing cancer cell sensitivity to TTFields was evaluated through <i>in vitro<\/i> combination treatment with PI3K inhibitors, followed by cell count measurements. Finally, the concomitant application of TTFields and the PI3K inhibitor Alpelisib was evaluated in mice orthotopically implanted with MOSE-L firefly luciferase (FFL) ovarian cancer cells. Tumor volume was measured using the In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) to detect the luciferin signal, before and after treatment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Cancer cell sensitivity to TTFields was reduced following continuous long-term application of TTFields. This was accompanied by activation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway, with significant increases in the levels of phosphorylated AKT and RPS6 observed in cell cultures and in rat tumor sections following application of TTFields. Application of PI3K inhibitors re-sensitized the cells to TTFields <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i>, concomitant application of TTFields with Alpelisib resulted in enhanced efficacy.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The current study demonstrated that reduced cancer cell sensitivity to long-term application of TTFields is mediated by activation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway.

Angiosarcomas are vascular malignancies that can occur anywhere in the body, and their metastatic propensity is high. The vascular sarcomas consist of disorganized, malignant vessel-forming cells. Recurrent mutations in the <i>PIK3CA<\/i> gene have been identified in angiosarcomas, and activation of the PI3K pathway appears to establish angiogenic programs. Naturally occurring hemangiosarcoma in dogs shares clinical and pathological features with human angiosarcoma. Our previous work has revealed that canine hemangiosarcomas and human angiosarcomas share mutational and transcriptional signatures that activate convergent PI3K signaling pathways. Appropriately powered canine studies take a comparative genomics approach, informing our research into human angiosarcomas. The cause of most sporadic angiosarcomas is unknown. Moreover, no therapeutic targets have been identified to improve outcomes. This study hypothesizes that the activation of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations contributes to the molecular programs that modulate the immune niche in angiosarcoma.<br \/>We first induced <i>PIK3CA<\/i> hotspot mutations (H1047R) in canine hemangiosarcoma cell line DHSA-1426 using CRISPR\/Cas9. We found that PI3K-alpha selective inhibitor BYL719 at 10uM decreased cell proliferation of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutant cells by 40-50% compared with that of wild-type cells. In comparison, no significant difference was observed between mutant and wild-type cells treated with pan PI3K inhibitor, ZSTK474. Our western blot data showed an increase in &#947;H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, in mutant cells when treated with BYL719 in a dose-dependent manner. BYL719 inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutant tumor cells. Our RNA-seq transcriptomic data analysis revealed that <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations altered gene regulation programs associated with lipid biosynthesis, including phosphatidylinositol, DNA replication, angiogenic and vascular functions, and immune regulation. These data suggest that the activation of the PI3K pathway is essential for tumor cell growth and that PI3K-alpha selective inhibitor interferes with <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation-induced pathways, including AKT and ERK, through DNA damage-dependent mechanism in angiosarcoma.<br \/>Our ongoing work is to determine if <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutant tumor cells have cell-autonomous capacity to govern hematopoietic progenitors and immune cells, potentially establishing the tumor immune niche. It also includes establishing single-cell gene expression profiles to identify distinct cell clusters between <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutant and wild-type cells, along with chromatin accessibility landscape using ATAC-seq. Tumorigenic capacity and immune regulatory mechanisms of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations will be determined in angiosarcoma xenograft models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1150fd46-2993-4266-82ac-6ecf306c9f75\/@C03B8ZDn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,PIK3CA,Angiosarcoma,PI3K,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15080"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emma Kozurek<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyan Silvia Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hai Dang Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jong Hyuk Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

The management of R\/R TCL is challenging and responses to second and beyond-line therapy are generally poor. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have identified the relevance of PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway in TCL biology. The combination of PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki) Duvelisib and the HDACi Romidepsin improved the overall response rate (ORR) of R\/R TCL to 50-55% in a phase I\/II study (Horwitz <i>et. al.<\/i> ASH 2018, Lugano 2021). Evaluation of PI3Ki and HDACi combinations in TCL pre-clinical models is needed to guide the design of future clinical trials.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>A panel of TCL cells lines were chosen representing T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A panel of PI3Ki (Omipalisib, Umbralisib and Duvelisib) and HDACi (Entinostat and Romidepsin) were selected to determine which combination would be most synergistic. Entinostat, an oral HDACi, was chosen for its remarkable preclinical and clinical activity in other lymphoma subtypes. Umbralisib is a new PI3K&#948; inhibitor which was recently approved for treatment of follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. Cells were exposed to Omipalisib (3.125-100nM), Umbralisib (1-320uM), or Duvelisib (1-100uM) alone or in combination with Entinostat (0.08-10uM) or Romidepsin (0.25-6) for 24, 48 and 72 hrs. Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo viability assay. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) at 72hrs was determined for each drug and coefficient of synergy was calculated using Calcusyn Software. Changes in cellular metabolism and cell cycle distribution after exposure to PI3Ki were determined using DiOC6 staining and Propidium Iodide staining respectively. Epigenetic changes following exposure to Entinostat or Romidepsin were investigated for possible mechanisms.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b><i>In vitro<\/i> exposure of TCL cell lines to PI3Ki or HDACi resulted in dose-dependent cell death. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> at 72 hrs was 30-500nM for Omipalisib, 9-35uM for Umbralisib, 1-35uM for Duvelisib, 0.2-2uM for Entinostat and for 1-4nM Romidepsin. All HDACi and Pi3Ki combinations demonstrated additive and\/or synergistic activity. Duvelisib combined with Entinostat or Romidepsin exhibited the most synergy. Methylation profiling demonstrated genomic wide hypomethylation, specifically DNMT3A, in Romidepsin treated samples compared to Entinostat.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>PI3Ki and HDACi combinations show significant synergy in TCL preclinical models. DNMT3A hypomethylation following Romidepsin exposure is being explored as the basis of PI3Ki and HDACi synergy.

Current treatments for HCC have limited efficacy. First-line HCC therapy atezolizumab with bevacizumab increased patient 6-month PFS from 37% to 55% relative to sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor currently serving as a standard-of-care treatment. Although immunotherapies provide survival benefits, reported patient response and disease control rates were 27% and 74%, respectively, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic agents that can re-establish responsiveness to immunotherapies and enhance their therapeutic effects.<br \/>Revolution Medicines has developed a class of selective mTORC1 inhibitors, termed &#8216;bi-steric&#8217;, which comprise a rapamycin-like core moiety covalently linked to an mTOR active-site inhibitor. RMC-6272 is a representative bi-steric inhibitor that exhibits potent and selective (&#62;30-fold) inhibition of mTORC1 over mTORC2. Several lines of evidence suggest that inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway may result in synthetic lethality of MYC-driven HCC. Thus, we hypothesized that MYC-driven HCC tumors are sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition and p-4EBP1 suppression. A single dose of RMC-6272 induced HCC regression in 80% of the Lap-tTA\/Tet-O-MYC mouse model of MYC-driven HCC, whereas sorafenib did not cause tumor regression. Mechanistically, RMC-6272 inhibited the phosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream substrates S6k and 4EBP1 and depleted MYC protein levels. Given that the MYC oncogene enables immune evasion in HCC, we hypothesized that by reducing MYC, RMC-6272 can re-establish anti-tumor immune surveillance and responsiveness to &#945;-PD-1 immunotherapy. Indeed, RMC-6272 induced tumor recruitment of dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, producing similar anti-tumor immunity as observed upon MYC genetic inactivation. Moreover, combining RMC-6272 with &#945;-PD-1 resulted in deeper tumor regression and a more durable response as compared to either RMC-6272 or &#945;-PD-1 alone in the MYC-driven HCC mouse model. By immunohistochemical staining and analysis, RMC-6272 in combination with &#945;-PD-1, but not either agent alone, promoted tumor recruitment of CD4+ T cells and NK cells, immune cell degranulation, and the release of perforins and granzymes in MYC-driven HCC tumors.<br \/>Our results show that the bi-steric mTORC1 inhibitor RMC-6272 synergizes with &#945;-PD-1 to induce immune activation and the release of perforins and granzymes, resulting in sustained tumor regression in a MYC-driven HCC mouse model. The bi-steric mTORC1 inhibitor RMC-5552 is the first clinical candidate of this class and clinical testing is ongoing (NCT04774952). These preclinical data highlight a prospective anti-cancer therapeutic opportunity for mTORC1 selective inhibitors in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in MYC-driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ecc5105d-0f0d-4fdb-9633-7cb14ac58fcc\/@C03B8ZDn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutics,Myc,mTOR,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15099"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wadie D.

BAY 2666605 has recently entered a First-in-Human study (NCT04809805) in patients with advanced solid tumors and here we describe its pre-clinical pharmacology profile. DNMDP, the precursor to BAY 2666605, was discovered in a phenotypic screen of genomically annotated cancer cell lines and sensitivity to treatment correlated to high expression of PDE3A (1). Upon treatment, SLFN12 is recruited into a stable complex with PDE3A where its RNase activity is enhanced and required for response (2). BAY 2666605 is a potent complex inducer (EC<sub>50<\/sub> = 7 nM) and cytotoxic <i>in vitro<\/i> with nanomolar potency (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 1nM, in the most sensitive cell lines). Cancer cells with high expression of PDE3A and co-expression of SLFN12 are killed by a mechanism independent of PDE3A enzymatic inhibition. PDE3A-SLFN12 binding is required for cytotoxicity. Biomarker-positive lines are enriched in the melanoma lineage and show dose-dependent sensitivity to BAY 2666605 both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Notably, we have consistently observed tumor regression in biomarker-positive melanoma models, including in PDX models (10mg\/kg po BID). Based on target expression data from TCGA and tumor arrays, various other tumor types also co-express PDE3A and SLFN12, such as sarcomas and ovarian cancer. To this end, we show that BAY 2666605 inhibits tumor growth of PDX models of sarcoma and ovarian cancer <i>in vivo<\/i>. BAY 2666605 has excellent brain penetration, making glioblastoma a promising indication. Biomarker-positive GBM models are sensitive to BAY 2666605 both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In a subset of orthotopic GBM models BAY 2666605 treatment has significant impact on survival. In BAY 2666605 treated models we have observed MCL1 downregulation and this biomarker will be evaluated in clinical settings. Our pre-clinical data indicate that BAY 2666605 is a potent anti-tumor agent with first-in-class potential and broad indication space.<br \/><i>1. de Waal et al.

The <i>KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup><\/i>mutation aberrantly attenuates GTPase activity, leading to accumulation of the GTP-bound activated form of the KRAS protein and activation of downstream signaling pathways. This genotype occurs in approximately 13% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and 1% to 3% of colorectal cancers and other solid tumors. In this study, investigational agent APG-1842 was characterized as a potent, selective, and covalent <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> inhibitor that irreversibly and specifically blocks <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> in an inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound state and downregulates KRAS-dependent signaling.<br \/>A RAS-GTP pull-down assay demonstrated that APG-1842 (at a concentration as low as 12 nM) completely blocked GDP-GTP nucleotide exchange, which stabilized an inactive GDP-bound form of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> and thereby inhibited RAS and RAF binding in <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>-mutant human NSCLC NCI-H358 cells. In these cells, APG-1842 dose dependently inhibited KRAS-dependent signaling target proteins, including phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), S6, and serine\/threonine protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B), with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) value of 4 nM for ERK1\/2 phosphorylation. Using a panel of 18 cancer cell lines representing multiple cancer types in cell viability assays, we found that APG-1842 selectively inhibited cell proliferation in <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>-mutated, but not non-<i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> or <i>KRAS<\/i> wild-type, cell lines.<br \/>Oral APG-1842 in mice carrying cell-derived NCI-H358 NSCLC subcutaneous xenografts exerted significant antitumor efficacy at doses ranging from 3 to 100 mg\/kg, resulting in tumor regression at 30 mg\/kg and above. Consistent with the cellular results, APG-1842 dose dependently inhibited ERK1\/2 and S6 phosphorylation in xenografts after 6 and 24 hours of treatment, correlating with systemic and tumor drug exposures. Significant antitumor activity of APG-1842 was also confirmed in a panel of 8 <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>-mutated patient-derived xenograft models derived from patient samples of lung, colorectal, and gastric cancers.<br \/>Collectively, these preclinical results suggest that APG-1842 is a potent, bioavailable, and highly selective <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> inhibitor, laying a foundation for clinical development of this agent for patients with <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>-mutant solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0233021a-db2b-4863-a530-2d5d0788fb6d\/@C03B8ZDn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inhibitors,KRASG12C,NSCLC,APG-1842,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15101"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shaoulai Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chao Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qixin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Douglas D.

With only one approved KRAS G12C inhibitor for NSCLC, KRAS-driven tumors continue to represent a significant unmet medical need where novel effective therapies are highly desired. Menin is a required co-factor of oncogenic transcriptional proteins with functional interactions that are critical for various malignancies including acute leukemia. We previously reported that BMF-219, a novel irreversible menin inhibitor, exhibits strong potency on acute leukemia (MOLM-13) and KRAS-mutant (MiaPaCa-2) cells. Results from MiaPaCa-2 cells prompted our exploration of the effects of BMF-219 in an expanded panel of KRAS-mutant solid tumors through in vitro and ex vivo preclinical models.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>BMF-219, clinical reversible menin inhibitors, or clinically approved KRAS G12C inhibitor, sotorasib, were cultured with CRC, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer cell lines for 4-days. Human ex vivo preclinical models harboring KRAS mutations were cultured with BMF-219 and reversible menin for 6-days. Cell viability was measured using CellTiter Glo and IC<sub>50<\/sub> values were calculated. MiaPaCa-2 cells incubated with BMF-219 were analyzed by RNA-seq on the Illumina NextSeq 550 platform.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>MiaPaCa-2, a KRAS G12C-mutant cell line, showed marked reduction of KRAS expression levels following 24 hours of BMF-219 treatment at 0.5 &#181;M. An expanded panel of 14 CRC, NSCLC and pancreatic KRAS-mutant cell lines harboring G12C, G12D, G12V, and Q61L revealed single-agent BMF-219 activity after a 4-day treatment. Majority of the cell lines tested exhibited &#62;90% inhibition of growth, independent of KRAS mutation type. Sotorasib reached a maximum of 90-93% growth inhibition in three of eight cell lines. By contrast, BMF-219 inhibited cell viability &#8805; 90% in six of eight KRAS G12C lung cancer lines. Human CRC, NSCLC and pancreatic ex vivo preclinical models with G12C, G12D, and G12V KRAS mutations were all sensitive to BMF-219 after a 6-day treatment. Complete abrogation of growth was observed in all samples with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging between 0.2 &#956;M - 0.6 &#956;M.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>KRAS-mutant CRC, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer cell lines and ex vivo preclinical models are highly sensitive to irreversible menin inhibitor, BMF-219, where clinical reversible menin inhibitors displayed limited activity. High potency of BMF-219 was observed amongst various KRAS-mutant cell lines suggesting that BMF-219 broadly inhibits these tumors. As an irreversible menin inhibitor, BMF-219, manifests advantages over the KRAS-targeted inhibitor sotorasib in multiple cell lines tested, and displays unique potency compared with clinical reversible menin inhibitors in ex vivo preclinical models of CRC, NSCLC, and pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c71e9405-ac52-4613-80df-1fd5693971b6\/@C03B8ZDn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Pancreatic cancer,Colon cancer,Menin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15102"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Brian Law<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Daniel Lu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priyanka Somanath<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James T.

During treatment most tumors will develop heterogeneous secondary mutations in <i>KIT<\/i> or <i>PDGFRA<\/i> inducing drug resistance, so there is an unmet need for novel therapies. We tested the efficacy of M4205, a novel specific <i>KIT<\/i> inhibitor with high activity towards the most relevant <i>KIT <\/i>mutations, in patient-derived GIST xenograft models.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> NMRI <i>nu\/nu<\/i> mice (n=146) were transplanted with patient-derived GIST xenograft models UZLX-GIST9 (<i>KIT:<\/i>p.P577del;W557LfsX5;D820G) known to be resistant to both imatinib and sunitinib, with the dose-dependent imatinib-sensitive and sunitinib-sensitive models UZLX-GIST2B (<i>KIT:<\/i>p.A502_Y503dup), UZLX-GIST25 (<i>KIT<\/i>: p.K642E) and the cell-line derived model GIST882 (<i>KIT<\/i>: p.K642E)*. Mice were treated daily with vehicle (control), imatinib (100mg\/kg), avapritinib (5mg\/kg), sunitinib (20mg\/kg), or M4205 (10mg\/kg, 25mg\/kg). Efficacy was assessed by tumor volume evolution, histopathology [hematoxilin &#38; eosine staining (H&#38;E)] and immunohistochemistry [Ki-67, phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3), cleaved PARP]. Histologic response (HR) was graded as previously described&#176;. Mann Whitney U and Wilcoxon Matched Pairs tests were used for statistical analysis, with p&#60;0.05 considered as significant.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> M4205 (25mg\/kg) caused tumor volume shrinkage in UZLX-GIST2B, -GIST25 and GIST882 with relative decrease to 45.6%, 35.1% and 57.3% on the last day as compared to baseline. In UZLX-GIST9 tumor growth to 132.4% was observed in M4205 (25mg\/kg)-treated tumors as compared to baseline. In all models we observed significant smaller tumor volumes in M4205 (25mg\/kg)-treated tumors compared to control, and this antitumor activity was superior to imatinib in UZLX-GIST9, -GIST2B and GIST882, and to sunitinib in -GIST25. Compared to controls, M4205 (25mg\/kg) induced a significant decrease in mitosis (H&#38;E) in all models, confirmed on pHH3 and Ki-67 immunostainings in three models. In -GIST25 and GIST882 grade 2-4 HR with myxoid degeneration was observed in all tumors. All treatments were well tolerated.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>M4205 has significant antitumor activity in patient- and cell line-derived GIST xenograft models.

These encouraging data are currently changing the treatment paradigm for patients with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-mutated tumors. However only a fraction of patients is initially responding to these compounds and patients who achieved an objective response ultimately progressed on-treatment. It became clear from these studies that KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors require a combination partner to either achieve a deeper response initially or to prevent development of resistance. Multiple rational combination approaches are currently investigated with the goal to prolong duration of response or to overcome KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor resistance. The KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor BI 1823911 is more potent compared to sotorasib or adagrasib and showed comparable <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy at a dose of 60 mg\/kg <i>vs.<\/i> 100 mg\/kg of either sotorasib or adagrasib in preclinical studies. The pan-KRAS SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 is the first direct KRAS signaling modifier, which entered phase I clinical trials both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors, MEK inhibitors and irinotecan. Pan-KRAS SOS1 inhibitors exhibit activity against a broad spectrum of KRAS alleles, including the major G12D\/V\/C and G13D oncoproteins, while sparing the interaction of KRAS with SOS2. In the presented combination concept BI 1701963 shifts the balance of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> to its GDP-loaded form, which is the state to which BI 1823911 covalently binds to. Here, we present pre-clinical data showing enhanced pathway modulation and synergistic anti-tumor effects following vertical pathway inhibition of BI 1823911 in combination with BI 1701963. Our preclinical results supported the start of a phase I trial (NCT04973163), investigating the safety, tolerability, recommended dose and preliminary efficacy of BI&#8239;1823911 alone and in combination with the pan-KRAS SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963. The trial includes cohorts of patients with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant solid tumors, such as NSCLC, CRC, cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, both KRAS therapy na&#239;ve or KRAS therapy relapsed. The first patients in the trial were treated in the monotherapy arm, dose escalation started at a dose of 50 mg. The combination therapy part is expected to start in Q1 2022. Primary endpoints include dose-limiting toxicities, treatment-emergent or -related adverse events. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetic properties of combination regimens and preliminary efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2f6fb467-9520-4d92-b1e1-05dfd79294e7\/@C03B8ZDn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,G12C,BI 1701963,BI 1823911,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15104"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Irene C.

GNAQ\/ GNA11 genetic alterations are present in 85% of cases resulting in activation of the MAPK pathway. Single agent approaches targeting the MAPK pathway and histone deacetylases (HDACs) have shown very modest activity in uveal melanoma. We hypothesize that a combination strategy may be an effective, novel therapeutic approach in uveal melanoma. We examined the activity of ASTX029, a novel dual-mechanism ERK inhibitor, which inhibits both the catalytic activity of ERK and its phosphorylation by MEK, and belinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, in one GNAQ<sup>Q209L<\/sup>- (92.1) and GNAQ<sup>Q209P<\/sup>- (OMM1.3) and two GNA11<sup>Q209L<\/sup>-mutant (MP41, OMM1) uveal melanoma cell lines. The uveal melanoma cell lines were sensitive to ASTX029 with IC50 values between 50 to 100nM and to belinostat with IC50 values between 100 to 250nM. Combination index analysis of ASTX029 and belinostat by the Chou-Talalay method indicated synergism, with CI values ranging from 0.34 to 0.97. We explored other drug candidates for combinatorial approaches including the BCL-2 inhibitor navitoclax, but no combination effect was observed. After 48h of combination treatment with ASTX029 and belinostat, we examined the biochemical effects by western blot which demonstrated a sustained decrease in levels of p-ERK with the combination treatment. Western blot analysis confirmed reduction of downstream markers of MAPK pathway activity including cell cycle markers p-RB (780), cyclin D1 and c-myc with combination treatment. Apoptosis was evident from an increase in the subG1 population by flow cytometry analysis, which correlated with BIM induction and PARP cleavage on western blot. We also observed increased surface expression of immunological markers HLA-A, B, C (MHC Class 1), PD-L1, gp100 and MART-1. These results support that a combination strategy targeting ERK and HDAC in uveal melanoma should be investigated further.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/11cdb50d-169c-4c8d-bf22-0c4177561231\/@C03B8ZDn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,ERK,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15105"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elgilda Musi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim-Hien Dao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Hindley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gary K.

Targeting KRAS mutant tumors by inhibiting individual nodes in the RAS\/MAPK pathway, including SHP2, SOS1, KRAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK, has shown early clinical activity, but the rapid emergence of resistance limits the benefit of monotherapy. Resistance is often mediated by reactivation of RAS\/MAPK pathway signaling, which can occur by increased activation of upstream of the RAS\/MAPK pathway (e.g., EGFR activation) and\/or activation of RAS\/MAPK pathway nodes (e.g., oncogenic BRAF and MEK mutations). Inhibiting both upstream and downstream RAS\/MAPK pathway nodes has the potential to more robustly prevent reactivation relative to inhibition of a single node alone. We are currently exploring the combination of an inhibitor of an upstream node, SHP2, with ERAS-601 and the terminal downstream node, ERK1\/2, with ERAS-007 (our first &#8220;MAPKlamp&#8221;) in nonclinical models.

In 14-day clonogenic assays in KRAS mutant NSCLC, CRC, and PDAC cell lines, this MAPKlamp inhibited colony growth more potently than ERAS-601 or ERAS-007 alone.

Targeted therapies, such as anti-EGFR inhibitors for patients with BRAF<sup>wt<\/sup>\/RAS<sup>wt<\/sup> CRC tumors and encorafenib + cetuximab for patients with BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> CRC tumors, are available treatment options but demonstrate both limited overall response rates and duration of response (Yaeger, 2018). In particular, in the previously treated setting, overall survival is typically less than a year (Grothey, 2013; Mayer, 2015; Kopetz, 2019). In addition, targeted treatment options are limited for patients harboring <i>KRAS<\/i> or <i>NRAS<\/i> mutations as emergence of these mutations is a predictive biomarker to anti-EGFR therapy resistance in metastatic CRC.<br \/>ERAS-007 is a selective ERK1\/2 inhibitor targeting the terminal node of the RAS\/MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, ERAS-007 demonstrates single digit nanomolar biochemical ERK1\/2 inhibition as well as a durable target residence time, thus making it a promising combination partner in RAS\/MAPK pathway activated or altered CRC. To this end, ERAS-007 was evaluated in preclinical models in combination with encorafenib + cetuximab in BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> CRC and with palbociclib in KRAS<sup>mut<\/sup> CRC. ERAS-007 demonstrated monotherapy activity and combination benefit in cell-based assays as well as superior combination efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i> relative to respective monotherapy control arms.<br \/>In summary, ERAS-007 demonstrates promising preclinical activity across a wide range of RAS\/MAPK pathway-driven CRC models both as a monotherapy and in combination that support further exploration in the clinic. Accordingly, ERAS-007 combinations with encorafenib + cetuximab in BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> CRC and with palbociclib in KRAS<sup>mut<\/sup> CRC are currently being evaluated in the HERKULES-3 phase 1b\/2 master protocol (NCT05039177).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1f8b5b72-7367-48d8-80be-d33deb73c9fc\/@D03B8ZDo\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15108"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erin D.

Oncogenic mutations of the <i>PIK3CA<\/i> gene leads to tumor initiation and progression. Copanlisib inhibits the PI3K pathway and has proven to be an effective treatment strategy for various cancers characterized by overactivation of the PI3K signaling cascade. However, resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies such as copanlisib are frequently encountered, and can be overcome through combination with another molecule such as romidepsin, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Here we aim to identify a novel therapeutic regimen for improved treatment of the molecular subtypes of CRC that can be targeted with PI3K inhibition.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Organoids were derived from colorectal cancer tumor tissue from two different biopsy sites from one patient with <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutant rectal cancer (RC46A and RC46B), as well as from a patient with <i>APC <\/i>and <i>TP53 <\/i>mutant CRC (MTB74) under approved IRB protocols. All organoids were plated and allowed to mature for 24 to 48 hours before treatment and baseline images were obtained. The organoids were imaged again 48 hours later, and response was determined by measuring the change in organoid diameter using ImageJ. Additionally, organoids were collected for immunoblotting to examine alterations in the PI3K pathway as well as histone acetylation, and proteins involved in apoptosis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Control organoids demonstrated increased median relative changes in diameter of +53.38%, +43.04% and +46.2% for RC46A, RC46B and MTB74, respectively. In comparison, the combination treatment group exhibited median relative changes for RC46A, RC46B and MTB74 as -29.19%, -46.46% and -100% (p&#60;0.001). These results were supported with immunoblot analysis that revealed a synergistic increase in histone acetylation with the combination treatment. Single agent copanlisib treatment elicited alterations in PI3K signaling including downregulation of pS6, pAKT, p4EBP1 as expected. Lastly, an increase in cleaved PARP was observed in combination treated organoids which is indicative of increased apoptosis.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> As molecular diagnostic technology continues to advance, treating each individual cancer with a targeted therapy based on molecular profiling is becoming more feasible. Dual inhibition of the PI3K pathway and HDAC is effective in reducing cell growth and proliferation of CRC organoids characterized by <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations, as well as other molecular subtypes such as cancers with <i>APC <\/i>and <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations.

Somatic mutations that activate the MAPK signaling pathway are a leading cause of melanoma with 50% harboring oncogenic BRAF alterations and another 20% with activating NRAS mutations. Of note, NRAS mutant melanoma has been shown to be dependent upon RAF signaling via CRAF dimers for downstream activation of MEK\/ERK. While targeted therapies are approved for V600 (Class I, monomer-driven) BRAF mutant melanoma, no approved targeted therapy exists for patients with melanoma driven by Class II or Class III dimer-dependent BRAF alterations or NRAS mutations. KIN-2787 is a novel, orally available, potent, and selective pan-RAF inhibitor designed to be effective in RAF-dependent cancers, including all classes of BRAF alterations, by targeting mutant BRAF monomers and RAF dimers, regardless of isoform.<br \/>Methods: KIN-2787 activity was assessed by suppression of downstream MAPK pathway signaling and subsequent cell growth inhibition in a panel of human melanoma cell lines. <i>In vivo <\/i>KIN-2787 efficacy<i> <\/i>was evaluated in BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma cell- and patient-derived xenograft models.<br \/>Results: KIN-2787 cellular activity was measured by inhibition of ERK phosphorylation across a panel of melanoma cell lines, including those harboring Class I BRAF alterations, Class II and III BRAF alterations, NRAS mutations, KRAS mutations, and wild type RAF\/RAS. In contrast to vemurafenib, an approved BRAF inhibitor with activity limited to Class I BRAF alterations, KIN-2787 was active across all classes of BRAF mutant melanoma cells (EC50 values &#60; 100 nM). NRAS and KRAS mutant cell lines were moderately responsive to KIN-2787 inhibition. Melanoma cells expressing wild type RAS\/RAF were the least sensitive to MAPK pathway inhibition by KIN-2787. KIN-2787 also inhibited cell proliferation in BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma in 2D and 3D cell cultures. Daily KIN-2787 treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in human melanoma xenograft models bearing Class I, II and III BRAF alterations as well as NRAS mutations and was associated with MAPK pathway suppression. Additionally, KIN-2787 was efficacious in a pre-\/post-treatment melanoma PDX pair in which the original tumor was Class I BRAF V600E but acquired a Class II BRAF kinase domain duplication upon progression on dabrafenib + trametinib. Details from the above findings will be presented at the meeting.<br \/>Conclusions: KIN-2787 is a next-generation, pan-RAF inhibitor with <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> activity against human melanoma driven by BRAF and\/or NRAS mutations. Data supports KIN-2787 use in acquired BRAF dimer-dependent resistance to BRAF+MEK inhibitor therapy. A Phase I dose escalation and expansion clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of KIN-2787 is ongoing (NCT04913285).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b4fad81c-15bf-4378-8b45-255ce3a08339\/@D03B8ZDo\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,RAF kinase,Ras,Kinase inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15110"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nichol L.

RAS cycles between inactive (GDP) and active (GTP) states to regulate the activity of the RAS\/MAPK pathway. In many cancers, activating KRAS mutations enable KRAS to persist in the active GTP-bound state, resulting in hyperactive RAS\/MAPK pathway signaling that drives cell growth and survival. The KRAS G12C mutation occurs in 14% of lung adenocarcinoma, a cancer type that frequently metastasizes to the brain (40%). To address the high prevalence of KRAS G12C mutant CNS metastases in lung adenocarcinoma, we are developing CNS-penetrant covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors (&#8220;ERAS G12Ci&#8217;s&#8221;) to treat both CNS and systemic disease. ERAS G12Ci&#8217;s rapidly form covalent adducts with the KRAS G12C protein in its inactive GDP state and exhibit low nanomolar IC50&#8217;s in a nucleotide exchange assay. ERAS G12Ci&#8217;s demonstrate high selectivity in a cell-based proteome selectivity assay and inhibit the growth of RAS Initiative KRAS G12C mutant cells, and not RAS Initiative KRAS WT cells. ERAS G12Ci&#8217;s potently inhibit cell proliferation in 3-dimensional Cell-Titer Glo (3D-CTG) assays in KRAS G12C mutant lung and pancreatic cell lines (NCI-H1373, NCI-H2122, and MIA PaCa-2). Mechanistically, ERAS G12Ci&#8217;s blocked RAS-RAF complex formation and inhibited ERK1\/2 phosphorylation. This <i>in vitro<\/i> activity translates <i>in vivo<\/i> where ERAS G12Ci&#8217;s induce pharmacodynamic modulation in the pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa-2 model. ERAS G12Ci&#8217;s significantly inhibit tumor growth in NCI-H1373 and NCI-H2122 CDX lung adenocarcinoma and MIA PaCa-2 PDAC models. No meaningful body weight loss or clinical adverse events were observed with any of these compounds. Human efflux transporter substrate assessments indicate that ERAS G12Ci&#8217;s are either not substrates or weak\/modest substrates of P-gp, a crucial efflux transporter that can limit CNS penetration. In rat CNS studies, these inhibitors exhibit good CNS penetration performance as measured by brain-to-plasma partition coefficients, which are comparable to those of approved CNS-active small molecule inhibitors. Daily oral administration demonstrates dose-dependent tumor regression in intracranial and intra-carotid injection (ICA) KRAS G12C CDX models.

Targeting specific components of the pathway is a precise and rational route to deliver benefits to cancer patients with high unmet therapeutic needs. The RAF kinase proteins (ARAF, BRAF, CRAF) are core pathway components which mediate MAPK signaling. Mutations in these critical signaling proteins leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway and tumor growth. Using state of the art screening methodologies and medicinal chemistry we discovered and developed a next generation pan-RAF kinase inhibitor, JZP815, which potently inhibits wild-type and mutant RAF kinases in cell-free and cell-based assays. JZP815 is a selective RAF kinase inhibitor that suppresses all 3 RAF kinase family members at low-to-sub nanomolar potencies in cell-free assays. Moreover, in tumor cells JZP815 does not induce significant paradoxical pathway activation, observed with approved 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation BRAF-selective inhibitors, while demonstrating equivalent potencies for MAPK pathway inhibition driven by either mutant RAF monomers or RAS-induced RAF dimers in tumor cells. JZP815 significantly inhibited tumor growth as a single agent in multiple mouse xenograft solid tumor models harboring RAS and\/or BRAF mutations. Furthermore, JZP815&#8217;s favorable pharmacokinetic profile sustained on-target pathway pharmacodynamic responses in a predictable dose and time dependent manner. JZP815 demonstrated enhanced activity when combined with inhibitors of other MAPK pathway components in both class 2 and class 3 mutant BRAF patient-derived tumor cells <i>ex vivo<\/i>, and KRAS mutant NSCLC and CRC xenografts <i>in vivo<\/i>. In summary, JZP815 is a potent and selective pan-RAF inhibitor that is orally bioavailable in multiple preclinical species with a well-behaved safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties predicted to provide drug exposure required for target engagement in humans, and therefore suitable for advancing into first-in-human trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a762bcc-abd5-4177-aadd-b4714a6349e2\/@D03B8ZDo\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RAF kinase,KRAS,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,BRAF,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15283"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Robert Hauptschein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Woodcock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Belfield<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helen Mason<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dorottya Keppel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svetlana Markova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyuri Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shane Roller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Phillips<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clifford D.

Triple-negative breast cancer cells frequently express persistent STAT3 phosphorylation and its cell viability is sensitive to STAT3 knockdown by siRNA. LLL12B selectively inhibited IL-6 mediated induction of STAT3 phosphorylation but had little effect on IFN-&#947; mediated induction of STAT1 phosphorylation or EGF mediated induction of ERK phosphorylation. LLL12B inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, induced cell apoptosis, and reduced cell colony formation in triple-negative breast cancer cells. In addition, LLL12B inhibited cell migration of triple-negative breast cancer cells. Furthermore, LLL12B suppressed tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells in a mammary fat pad syngeneic mouse model.

Activating mutations in KRAS are a hallmark of cancer. Clinical targeting of KRAS G12C mutation has demonstrated profound overall response rate (ORR) with relatively short progression-free survival (PFS). Some potential reasons for short PFS are MAPK pathway re-activation through wild type RAS and activation of PI3K\/mTOR pathway, which lead to the bypass and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors. The combination of KRAS G12C inhibitor with mTOR or ERK1\/2 inhibitor might overcome drug resistance and prolong PFS. This study tested the antitumor effects induced by the combination of ATG-012, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, with SHP2 inhibitor (ET0038), ERK 1\/2 kinase inhibitor (ATG-017), mTORC1\/2 kinase inhibitor (ATG-008) or XPO1 inhibitor (selinexor), in preclinical tumor models.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The in vivo combinations of the drugs were tested in NCI-H358 (non-small cell lung cancer) and Mia-Paca-2 (pancreatic cancer) CDX mouse model. The tumor bearing mouse were treated with vehicle control, ATG-012 (3 to 100 mg\/kg, QD), ET0038 (5mg\/kg, QD), selinexor (10mg\/kg, MWF), ATG-017 (25mg\/kg, QD), ATG-008 (10mg\/kg, QD) or the combination for 18 to 27 days. Tumor size was measured twice a week and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was evaluated compared with vehicle control group.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the NCI-H358 CDX in vivo study, mono therapy with ATG-012 (10mg\/kg), selinexor, or ATG-017 induced tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 44.29% ,73.71% and 80.85%, respectively on day 8 after grouping.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLCs) comprises 84% of all lung cancer cases, and of these, 40% are lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Moreover, black Americans are underrepresented in scientific clinical trials but have a lung cancer incidence rate that is 37% higher than their white counterparts. To address this disparity and lack of effective treatment options, we determined the potency of polyisoprenylated cysteinyl amide inhibitors (PCAIs) on cell viability and its effects on KRAS and its downstream mediators in NCI-H23, a black American cell line that harbors a <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation. Among the 17 PCAIs that were tested, compound NSL-YHJ-2-27 showed the most potency with an EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 2.7 &#181;M. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the effect of the PCAIs on the levels of Mitogen-Activated Pathway Kinase (MAPK)-related proteins. After 48 h of exposure to 5 &#956;M of NSL-YHJ-2-27, we observed increases of 150, 64.5, and 77% in phosphorylation levels of ERK1\/2, MEK1\/2, and 90RSK. While the particular 90RSK enzymes whose phosphorylation is\/are elevated are not known at this time, 90RSK 3 and 4 are known to be proapoptotic. These findings suggest that the PCAIs may be used to target cancers with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations that currently lack effective therapies. In the future, we will use a collection of isogenic cell lines to examine the potency of the PCAIs in LUAD driven by other RAS and related monomeric G-proteins, epidermal growth factors, and their receptors as well as RAS-GAPs. Therapies emanating from these studies have the potential to contribute to mitigating the lung cancer therapeutic inequities.<br \/><b>Keywords: <\/b><u>Polyisoprenylated Cysteinyl Amide Inhibitors (PCAIs)<\/u><u><\/u>, Mitogen Activated Pathway Kinases (MAPK), KRAS, Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLCs)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d78e7b1f-dff1-41f4-84d1-b33c9fd85351\/@E03B8ZDp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Lung adenocarcinoma,KRAS,African American,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15386"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew D.

RAS proteins function as molecular switches, cycling between inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) states, which relay cellular signals in response to extracellular stimuli. Aberrant RAS signaling plays a role in up to 30% of all human cancers, with the highest incidence occurring in carcinomas of the pancreas (63&#8211;90%), colon (36&#8211;50%), and lung (19&#8211;30%). Targeting the inactive, GDP bound KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> has been a promising approach for generating novel anti RAS therapies, which is validated by the approval of AMG 510 (Lumakras) by the FDA. It is also known that KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> also retains GTPase activity. Consequently, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> is one of the most important chemotherapeutic drug targets. KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> is commonly observed in pancreatic cancer. Here we describe preclinical profile of a potent, selective, in-vivo tool compound, VRTX144. VRTX144 was potent in HPAC cell line, representing pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and a panel of KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>mutated cell lines. It was found to be several folds less active in non-KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>mutant cell lines. In vitro combination strategies with other targeted therapies such as EGFR, SHP2 and CDK4\/6 inhibitor is also being investigated. VRTX144 exhibited low propensity for metabolism in microsomes, and has high protein bound. VRTX144 was found to have no adverse effect in hERG upto 10 uM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a310b1d-349f-4268-a5c5-4f0715b4d9ea\/@E03B8ZDp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Mutations,small molecule inhibitors,Pancreatic cancer &amp; Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15491"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Prashant Kashinath Bhavar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uday Kumar Surampudi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Partha Pratim Sarma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahesh Mohan Shidore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anuj Ramesh Kshirsagar<\/i><\/presenter>.

Response to ESD0140656 is correlated to sensitivity to CRISPR\/Cas9 KO of components of the protein lipoylation pathway and OGDH complex members, which catalyze a step of the TCA cycle. Lipoylation is a rare post-translational modification attached to just four enzymes in humans, including the OGDH complex. Knockout of the protein that transfers lipoic acid to these four enzymes (LIPT1) sensitizes cells to ESD0140656, and ESD0140656 treatment leads to reduction of lipoic acid in cells.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been the subject of intensive studies due to its aggressive nature which makes it difficult to treat. Since inclusive treatment for this type had been elusive for decades, it is thus imperative to develop new therapeutic agents to mitigate its deadly effects. PCAIs are novel compounds designed to mimic the essential posttranslational modifications of G-proteins such as KRAS. This study elucidates the effect of the PCAIs downstream of KRAS, specifically on the mitogen activated pathway kinase (MAPK) enzymes. Two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, were used to determine the levels of phosphorylation in several MAPK pathway enzymes. After exposure of the cells to varying concentrations of PCAIs (NSL-YHJ-2-27) for 48 hours, western blot results showed remarkable differences in the phosphorylated levels of the respective enzymes in cells treated with 5 &#181;m of the PCAIs as compared to the control (NSL-YHJ-2-62). Interestingly, the cell lines reacted differently after treatment, in which MDA-MB-468 cells showed increased levels of phosphorylated MEK, ERK, and 90RSK by 122, 273 and 242%, respectively. However, in MDA-MB-231, only the phosphorylated 90RSK showed an increase of 105% and no changes in the other two enzymes. Moreover, a very distinct difference was observed in the levels of phosphorylated BRAF (p-BRAF) and CRAF (p-CRAF). In MDA-MB-231 cells, no change in p-BRAF levels while a 184% increase in p-CRAF were observed. In MDA-MB-468, p-BRAF increased by 41% and p-CRAF decreased by 58%. The differences in the response of the cell lines may reflect their unique genetics. These results show the ability of the PCAIs to interfere with the MAPK pathway. As this signaling cascade plays a very important role in cell response as well as in the progression of cancers, therefore, therapeutics targeting this pathway have a great potential in the development of treatments not only for TNBC but also for other kinds of cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/264ce560-7255-42e6-a416-3b56971e92aa\/@E03B8ZDp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Inhibitors,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15510"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jassy Mary Lazarte<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nada Tawfeeq<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yonghao Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nazarius Lamango<\/i><\/presenter>.
