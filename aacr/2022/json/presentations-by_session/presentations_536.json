[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Microbiota plays an essential role in the oral cavity and oral dysbiosis, leading to inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis. Periodontal disease is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of oral cancer; thus, evaluating polymicrobial associations across a gradient of periodontitis will help understand the microbial processes that could influence cancer development. We aimed to study the association of oral bacteria and fungi linked to high-risk behavior and periodontal disease.<br \/>Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited individuals aged 21 to 49 from sexually transmitted infection clinics in Puerto Rico. A total of 88 participants underwent a full-mouth periodontal examination following the NHANES protocol. Periodontal severity was defined according to the CDC\/AAP. Saliva was collected for genomic DNA extraction, and downstream 16S V4 and ITS-2 genes were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed with standard bioinformatics pipelines.<br \/>Results: Nearly 29% of individuals had some degree of periodontal disease. Bacterial community analyses revealed differences in both composition and diversity as the periodontal disease progressed. The predominance of <i>Prevotella and Veillonella<\/i> in the salivary microbiota was attributed to periodontal conditions with low levels of <i>Lactobacillus<\/i> in patients with severe disease. In contrast, the predominance of <i>Neisseria<\/i> was related to healthy participants. Fungal communities changed in composition with disease severity, including the dominance of <i>Candida tropicalis<\/i>. Co-occurrence analyses revealed that <i>Lactobacillus <\/i>co-occurred with <i>Candida dubliniensis, C. tropicalis,<\/i> and<i> Saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/i> in individuals with periodontal diseas<i>e.<br \/><\/i>Conclusion: Co-occurrence patterns of bacteria and fungi changed from participants with no disease to periodontal severity.<i> Lactobacillus<\/i> has been identified in caries, xerostomia, and saliva of HPV-positive head and neck cancer patients. This study is the first to report the co-occurrence of this <i>Lactobacillus<\/i> with oral candidiasis in periodontal severity. We expect that these biofilms induce inflammation in periodontal pockets while also making them more resistant to treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/06be172d-bf72-49c5-a644-206bd2ebcb33\/@u03B8ZRN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Oral cancers,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17713"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kimil T.

Preclinical studies of such novel therapies require animal models that enable and sustain human erythrocyte reconstitution. Existing mouse models typically require irradiation to remove mouse HSCs from the bone marrow prior to human immune system reconstitution. Irradiation adversely affects the health of the animal by promoting necrosis and apoptosis of gastrointestinal, neural and muscle tissues, which can lead to wasting, infection, and even death. An irradiation-free mouse model for human erythroid reconstitution is in urgent need. KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as c-KIT, is an important cell surface marker expressed in both mouse and human HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPP), and common myeloid progenitors (CMP). KIT signaling plays a key role in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Alterned forms of this protein have been shown to be associated with some types of cancer. Point mutation of Val831Met is known to cause macrocytic anemia. We speculate that mice with this mutation experience spontaneous anemia and inhibited HSC function, which would support human erythroid reconstitution without irradiation. NCG-X mouse was generated based on this hypothesis, building upon the severe immunodeficient NCG generated by GemPharmatech years ago. This new strain of mice are deficient of T\/B\/NK cells with functional inhibition of HSCs. Here, we report that NCG-X supports human HSC transplantation without radiation, enabling complete avoidance of adverse effects on animal health. When compared with irradiated NCG mice, NCG-X mice are able to not only rebuild the human immune system, but also enable human erythroid cells to reconstruct the bone marrow for a prolonged period of time after engraftment: 16 and 30 weeks post-engraftment have been assayed. Though reduced red blood cells and hemoglobin have been observed, 30 weeks post-engraftment enables consistent support from the start to the finish of the preclinical phase. In conclusion, NCG-X provides an improved and preclinical relevant mouse model for therapeutic development of leukemia, thalassemia, other types of blood diseases and autoimmune diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a29b1b57-8ff4-41fb-a13c-6b9ccc9abd9f\/@v03B8ZRP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"c-Kit,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17715"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tingting Gu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunxiang Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>MingKun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiwei Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengting Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huiyi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>.

GITRL, the ligand of GITR is mainly expressed on antigen presenting cells. GITR\/GITRL interaction plays an important role on the development of immune response, which can serve as promising anti-tumor target. While more than twenty anti-GITR antibodies are at clinical stages, combination treatments of GITR agonist and PD-1 inhibitor may be a better choice. Thus, there is a need for pre-clinical mouse model to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of humanized PD1\/GITR antibodies. Gempharmatech established PD1\/GITR double humanized mouse line on a BALB\/c background, in which the extracellular domain of mGITR was replaced with its human counterparts while the trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domain kept intact, as well as the same strategy of PD1. BALB\/c-hPD1\/hGITR mouse could successfully express similar levels of hGITR and hPD1 compared with BALB\/c wild type mice. Moreover, no immune or developmental abnormalities were observed in the humanized mouse. Anti-GITR combination with anti-PD1 presented greater tumor growth inhibition than anti-PD1 or anti-GITR monotherapies in PD1\/GITR double humanized mouse bearing CT26 tumors. In summary, BALB\/c-hPD1\/hGITR are valuable models for the pre-cilincal evaluation of candidate humanized PD1\/GITR combination treatment or bispecific antibody therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5405152b-8b1c-446e-addc-9dd130ca1a94\/@v03B8ZRP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Humanized mouse,hPD1\/hGITR,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17716"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dongdong Yuan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongdong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingkun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liyou Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunxiang Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huiyi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Gao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a highly immunogenic cancer characterized by an aberrant aerobic glycolytic metabolism and is known to overexpress PD-L1. Multiple immunotherapies have been approved for the treatment of ccRCC, including cytokines and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Recently the intrinsic role of PD-L1 and interferon gamma (IFN&#947;) signaling have been studied in several types of tumor cells, yet it remains unclear how they affect the metabolism and signaling pathways of ccRCC. Using metabolomics, metabolic assays and RNAseq, we showed that IFN&#947; enhanced aerobic glycolysis and tryptophan metabolism in ccRCC cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and induced the transcriptional expression of signaling pathways related to inflammation, cell proliferation and cellular energetics. These metabolic and transcriptional effects were partially reversed following PD-L1 transient silencing. Aerobic glycolysis as well as signaling pathways related to inflammation were not induced by IFN&#947; when PD-L1 was silenced, however tryptophan metabolism and activation of Jak2 and STAT1 were maintained. Our data demonstrate that PD-L1 expression is required to mediate some of IFN&#947;&#8217;s effect in ccRCC cells and highlight the importance of PD-L1 signaling in regulating the metabolism of ccRCC cells in response to inflammatory signals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7cc2d17c-d17f-4553-8e44-1cfcdd13af67\/@v03B8ZRP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Interferons,Metabolism,Kidney cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17718"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mamatha Garige<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susmita Ghosh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>ALexis Norris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangyuan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carole Sourbier<\/i><\/presenter>.

Bone marrow (BM) generated M-LECPs are a subset of M2-type of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that heavily infiltrate breast and other human cancers. The M2-type of TAMs is primarily induced by immunosuppressive Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10. The goal of this study was to determine whether Th2 factors also promote the lymphatic phenotype in precursors of M-LECPs.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Mouse BM cells were differentiated into M-LECPs by priming with CSF-1 followed by activation of LPS-TLR4 pathway. Transcripts of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 were measured by qPCR, and their proteins secreted into conditioned medium were detected by ELISA. The levels of receptors for Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 as well as for stem cells (CD117, Sca-1), M2-TAMs (CD204, CD206) and lymphatic endothelial cells (Lyve-1, podoplanin, integrin-9a, collectin-12 and stabilin-1) were quantified by qPCR and flow cytometry. Impact of TLR4 induced autocrine IL-10 pathway was determined by analyzing the surface markers and gene profiles of differentiated M-LECPs in the presence of IL-10 blocking or control antibodies. Tumor levels of Th2 cytokines and expression of Th2 receptors in Lyve-1<sup>+<\/sup> progenitors were detected by ELISA and immunofluorescence, respectively.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>More than 95% of myeloid precursors treated with CSF-1 and LPS upregulated all three Th2 receptors and IL-10 but not IL-4 or IL-13 ligands. All receptors were functional as indicated by upregulation of M2, immunosuppressive, lymphatic and stem markers in cells co-treated with exogenous Th2 ligands as compared with CSF-1 alone. Blocking autocrine IL-10 significantly suppressed both M2-specific and pro-lymphatic differentiation. Tumor-infiltrating M-LECPs expressed Th2 receptors as well as all corresponding ligands including IL-4 and IL-13 that were absent in the BM cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: These data present a novel evidence that activation of immunosuppressive Th2 pathways in BM myeloid precursors induces both the M2-type and lymphatic phenotype. Expansion of lymphatics can enhance tumor immunosuppression by physical removal of immunostimulatory cells. These findings suggest that targeting Th2 pathways can simultaneously relieve immunosuppression and inhibit differentiation of pro-lymphatic progenitors that promote metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b510d86d-c18b-4ae8-b4d7-4600c955d4e7\/@v03B8ZRP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphangiogenesis,Immunosuppression,Interleukin-10,Endothelial progenitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17720"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Maria Espinoza Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Lisa Volk-Draper<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nihit Bhattarai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia Ran<\/i><\/presenter>.

While sTIL were not associated with outcome in patients (pts) treated with trastuzumab in N9831, immune functions genes are linked to outcome in these pts. TLS is an organized form of ectopic lymphoid aggregates (LA) with secondary lymphoid organ structure. Several studies showed that TLS associates with improved outcome in multiple cancers. However, distinguishing TLS and simple LA is challenging, particularly when germinal center is absent. In this study, we evaluated integrated pathological quantification and genomic data to assess functional TLS.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pathological evaluation of LA in H&#38;E slides from pts treated in Arm A (chemotherapy alone) and Arm C (chemotherapy with concurrent trastuzumab) in N9831 was performed. NanoString was used to quantify mRNA. Wilcoxon rank sum test, Chi squared test, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to evaluate association between LA and baseline characteristics as well as outcomes.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> LA was quantified in 1011 pts (526 Arm A, 485 Arm C). Greater number of LA was significantly associated with higher tumor grade, ER\/PR negativity and increasing sTIL, but not age, tumor size or lymph node status. Increasing numbers of LA were associated with improved RFS in both arms combined (p 0.028). However, using multivariable Cox regression analysis in each treatment arm, LA (&#8805; 1 vs 0) was associated with improved RFS only in Arm A (HR 0.6, 95%CI 0.43-0.84, p 0.003) but not Arm C (HR 0.72, 95%CI 0.47-1.1, p 0.134). Further evaluation of expression of TLS-related immune genes including <i>IFNG, ICOSLG, CXCL13, CXCR3, BCL6, IL21R, ICOS, PDCD1, CXCR5, CXCL9, TBX21, CD38, CXCL10, CLXCL11, IL21, CD200 <\/i>was carried out among 252 pts in Arm C with LA &#8805; 1. Among these 16 TLS-related immune genes, as a continuous variable, higher expression of <i>BCL6<\/i> (HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.41-0.92, p 0.019) and <i>IL21R<\/i> (HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.62-0.98, p 0.03) were associated with improved RFS in Arm C pts with LA &#8805; 1. However, these genes were not significantly associated with outcome in Arm C pts without LA with BCL6 HR1.07 (95%CI 0.67-1.71, p 0.776) and IL21R HR 0.96 (95%CI 0.71-1.29, p 0.775).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Similar to sTIL, greater number of LA was associated with improved outcome in HER2+ pts treated with chemotherapy alone but not chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab. Using histogenomic integration with the combination of pathological LA and TLS-related immune genes, we identified that pts with functional TLS with LA &#8805; 1 and higher expression of <i>BCL6<\/i> or <i>IL21R<\/i> had significantly improved outcome when treated with trastuzumab.

Gamma-delta T cells can recognize a broad range of antigens to provide rapid responses to pathogens, and can also interact with both immune cells and non-immune tissue cells triggering regulatory and cytotoxic responses. These unique features make them ideal candidates that could be targeted to induce durable immunity in the context of different pathologies. There has been growing interest in understanding the contributions of gamma-delta T cells to immunology and developing efficient gamma-delta T-cell-based therapies for cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmune disease. In this study, we have implemented T cell repertoire sequencing for high throughput characterization. Gamma-delta T cells were enriched from tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). RNA was extracted and used to generate full length TCR<b> <\/b>libraries. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were incorporated to discretely barcode each mRNA molecule, enabling absolute quantitative ranking of TCR clone abundance. Full length immune repertoire sequencing facilitates the detection of distinct and shared clones in tissue and blood samples, enabling the identification of disease specific clones to evaluate immunotherapy effects.

It is reported that human tumors accumulate more Tregs than peripheral blood. However, it remains unclear whether intratumoral Tregs are primarily derived from Tregs in tumor-draining lymph nodes (dLNs) or are converted from conventional CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (Tconvs) in the transforming growth factor-beta -rich tumor microenvironment.Because each T-cell clone has its unique T-cell receptor (TCR), tracking the TCRs of the tumor Treg repertoire in the dLN Treg, dLN Tconv, and tumor Tconv enables us to identify the primary source of intratumoral Tregs. GFP<sup>+<\/sup> hCD2<sup>+<\/sup> CD25<sup>high<\/sup> and GFP<sup>-<\/sup> hCD2<sup>+<\/sup> CD25<sup>int<\/sup> Tregs, which we defined as mature and immature Tregs, respectively, are distinguished from Tconvs in Foxp3-GDL Tg &#215; Foxp3hCD2 <\/sup>Treg reporter mice having the Foxp3-GFP-diphtheria toxin receptor transgene and Foxp3-human CD2\/CD52 knocked-in locus. On day 14 after subcutaneous injection of the Lewis lung carcinoma cell line, CD4+<\/sup> Treg subsets and Tconvs in the tumor and dLN were collected for TCR sequencing, and the TCR repertoire overlap between these populations was quantified.We found that approximately 70%-80% of the Treg repertoire in the tumor overlapped with that in the dLN. Overlap between tumor Treg and tumor Tconv or dLN Tconv was at most 30% in tumor Tregs, significantly smaller than the tumor Treg-dLN Treg overlap. Moreover, single-cell TCR\/RNA sequencing analysis exhibited that the tumor and dLN Treg clusters shared a significant number of T-cell clones, with few clones shared with tumor or dLN Tconv clusters. To examine whether dLN Tregs were the source of tumor Tregs even when they were actively repopulating, GFP<sup>+<\/sup> mature Tregs were transiently depleted by administrating diphtheria toxin to tumor bearing mice. Mature tumor Tregs were completely depleted by day 2 and recovered rapidly through day 5 after DT administration. Analysis of the TCR repertoire of repopulated Treg and Tconv subsets revealed that repertoire overlap between tumor Treg and dLN or tumor Tconv was small and that tumor Treg-dLN Tregs overlap remained dominant, proposing that the repopulated intratumoral Tregs were also mainly derived from dLN Tregs. These results demonstrated that dLN-tumor mobilization was the primary source of intratumoral Tregs and that Tregs converted from Tconvs comprised only a small fraction of the intratumoral Tregs in our model. This finding suggests that Treg clones that suppress anti-tumor responses in the tumor also inhibit the priming of tumor-reactive T cells in the dLN, which can limit the efficacy of tumor site-specific Treg depletion therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/156cd473-3611-46b8-9dab-2dfee9527cc1\/@w03B8ZRQ\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,T cell receptor repertoire,Single cell sequencing,Foxp3 reporter mice,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18664"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hiroyasu Aoki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haruka Shimizu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shigeyuki Shichino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikiya Tsunoda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haru Ogiwara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shohei Hori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kouji Matsushima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Ueha<\/i><\/presenter>.

Patients with FAP have a nearly 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) due to the formation of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract<sup>2<\/sup>. A clinical trial in FAP patients demonstrated that Cox-1\/2 inhibitor sulindac (SUL) plus EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (ERL) reduced polyp burden significantly in the colon and small intestine (SI), but toxicity issues raised concerns for durable long-term CRC interception<sup>3<\/sup>. In the <i>Apc<\/i>-mutant polyposis in rat colon (Pirc) rat model of FAP, we determined low-dose regimens of ERL+SUL that were both safe and efficacious<sup>4<\/sup>. In the current investigation, the lowest tested dose of dietary SUL (125 ppm continuously) plus ERL (5 mg\/kg twice weekly), given at one-half the SUL clinical dose and one-fourth of the ERL clinical dose, administered for 46 weeks respectively, demonstrated good inhibition of tumor burden in the colon (&#62;85% efficacy, p&#60;0.05) and SI (&#62;94% efficacy, p&#60;0.05) compared to untreated controls. Moreover, treatment normalized organ weights and hematocrits that were altered in the untreated AIN controls.Recently, ERL<sup>5<\/sup> and SUL<sup>6<\/sup> were individually demonstrated to increase the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells in mouse models of lung and colon cancer, respectively. However, ERL+SUL in combination was not investigated in the context of immune cell infiltration and polarization. Our preliminary IHC data in the Pirc model indicated increased recruitment of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in colon polyps by SUL 250 ppm + ERL 42 mg\/kg once a week. RT-qPCR and immunoblotting analysis of colon polyps obtained from the low-dose combination of SUL 125 ppm + ERL 5 mg\/kg twice weekly demonstrated increased CD4 expression and concurrently decreased oncogenic IL-17 expression and tumor associated macrophage markers (CD163 and CD206) (P&#60;0.05 vs control). Additional immune markers will be identified and validated via CyTOF. We hypothesize that low-dose combination of SUL+ERL can enhance the recruitment of immune cells into early adenomatous colon and SI polyps, providing an effective immunointerception strategy, with potential clinical relevance for FAP patients before or after colectomy.<br \/><b>Acknowledgements <\/b>Research supported by NCI Contract Number 75N91019D00021, Task Order 75N91019F00130.<br \/>1.Groden J <i>et al<\/i>., <i>Cell<\/i> 1991; 66:589-600.2.Jasperson KW <i>et al<\/i>., <i>Gastroenterology<\/i> 2010; 138:2044-2058.<u>3.<\/u>Samadder NJ <i>et. al<\/i>., <i>JAMA<\/i> 2016; 315:1266-75.<u>4.<\/u>Ulusan AM <i>et. al., Cancer Prev Res (Phila)<\/i>. 2021; 14:325-336.<u>5.<\/u>Ayeni D <i>et al<\/i>., <i>J Immunother Cancer<\/i> 2019; 7:172.<u>6.<\/u>Yi B <i>et al<\/i>., <i>Mol Cancer Ther<\/i> 2021; Apr 20.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/39c00e42-5708-40a3-a820-f738da7d5cb4\/@w03B8ZRQ\/mp4?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Immune response,Epigenetics,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18665"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chakrapani Tripathi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roderick H.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen presentation pathways (APPs) play a crucial role in promoting tumor T-cell recognition and initiating antitumoral immune responses. However, epigenetic silencing of APPs is a common mechanism in various cancers, including melanoma and gastrointestinal malignancies [3,4]. In the current investigation, mouse melanoma (B16\/OVA) and human colon cancer (LOVO and HCT116), small intestine cancer (HUTU80), and normal colonic epithelial (CCD841) cell lines were treated with epigenetic drug candidates. As reported [5], a decrease in histone H3K27 methylation marks via polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) inhibitors, as well as altered histone acetylation status from histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-specific inhibition, increased the expression of APP components, based on immunoblotting and RT-qPCR experiments. Normal colonic epithelial cells showed resistance to the treatments, indicating cancer cell-specific effects of the test agents. In B16\/OVA cells, flow cytometry and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays corroborated that HDAC3 and\/or PRC2 inhibitor combinations increased cell surface occupancy of MHC-I complexes and increased CD8+ T-cell activation. These findings have implications for the clinical application of next-generation combinatorial epigenetic agents [6,7], targeted towards increased tumor immunogenicity and enhanced efficacy of new immunoepigenetic strategies.

In the liver, macrophages are the most abundant immune cell subset, yet their role in regulating liver metastasis remains poorly understood. Two distinct macrophage populations exist in the liver: liver-resident Clec4f<sup>+<\/sup>F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup> Kupffer cells (KCs) and Clec4f<sup>neg<\/sup>F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup> bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). Here, we sought to understand the impact of these macrophage subsets on liver metastasis and the ability of a myeloid agonist, a &#946;-glucan (BG), to skew macrophages towards an anti-metastatic phenotype.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> C57BL\/6 mice were given an intraportal (iPo) injection of an <i>LSL-KrasG12D\/+;LSL-Trp53R172H\/+;Pdx-1-Cre;LSL-Rosa26-Yfp <\/i>(KPCY) cell line to model liver metastasis. Mice were necropsied 2 days later to measure metastatic seeding of cancer cells or 12-14 days later to assess metastatic lesion outgrowth. Liver metastatic burden and immune cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In macrophage depletion experiments, liver macrophages were depleted using clodronate encapsulated liposomes (CEL) delivered intraperitoneally. In studies involving BG treatment, weekly intravenous administration of BG began 2 days prior to iPo injection of cancer cells.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Liver macrophage depletion did not influence metastatic seeding in the liver; but, did inhibit the outgrowth of established metastatic colonies. Histological analysis showed that Clec4f<sup>+ <\/sup>KCs were excluded from metastatic lesions, whereas BMDMs actively infiltrated. BMDM infiltration into lesions was also largely unaffected by CEL treatment. To stimulate macrophages with anti-metastatic activity, BG was administered systemically and found to bind to &#62;95% of KCs but only 30% of BMDMs and 20-35% of other immune cell populations. BG treatment attenuated liver metastasis when given during both the seeding and outgrowth phases of metastasis (mean metastatic burden as % live cells in liver: 1%, BG vs 6.5%, control, p&#60;0.0001). Analysis of metastatic lesions in BG treated mice by histology showed smaller lesions (mean size: 0.9mm<sup>2<\/sup>, BG vs 1.5mm<sup>2<\/sup>, control, p=0.09), decreased proliferating cancer cells (mean # of proliferating cancer cells per unit metastatic area: 480, BG vs 810, control, p&#60;0.0001), and increased numbers of CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells at the periphery of lesions compared to lesions from control mice (mean # of T cells per mm<sup>2<\/sup> metastatic area: 300, BG vs 135, control, p&#60;0.0001). The efficacy of BG to restrict liver metastasis was dependent on liver macrophages.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Taken together, these findings suggest that, while liver macrophages can be coopted to support metastatic outgrowth, treatment with a &#946;-glucan, as a myeloid agonist is a novel strategy to engender liver macrophages with anti-metastatic activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/534f8357-0db5-4e88-9ef6-f2aa2f13c01b\/@w03B8ZRQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Metastasis,Liver,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18667"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"e510da22-e739-4132-82c6-35bf6628b31d","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e510da22-e739-4132-82c6-35bf6628b31d\/@w03B8ZRQ\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stacy K.

Here we show that mtDNA is enriched in <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant tumor where the dsDNA-sensor machinery cGAS-STING signaling is autonomously activated at the baseline. Intriguingly, MEK inhibitor induces cytosolic mtDNA release to potently activate cGAS-STING pathway, that is counteracted by PRKN-mediated mitophagy to eliminate mtDNA within damaged mitochondria in <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant tumor. Combined MEK and mitophagy inhibitors synergistically boost type I IFNs through mitochondrial stress and promote lymphocyte infiltration into the TME in a mtDNA efflux-dependent manner.

However, it is now clear in the murine setting that IFN&#947;-producing &#947;&#948; T cells reject tumours whilst IL-17-producing &#947;&#948; T cells promote them. Nonetheless, many human &#947;&#948; T cell compartments are distinct from that in mice and vice versa. The extent to which human tissues and tumours harbour resident &#947;&#948; T cells, their effector function and their role in cancer is less clear. Although a large scale <i>in silico<\/i> study of 5000+ patients with cancer found that intratumoural &#947;&#948; T cells were the most important correlate of survival, smaller studies have found that these cells to be associated with either survival or progression. Many historical studies have however been limited by the availability of technologies to rigorously identify, isolate, and examine tissue-resident &#947;&#948; T cells.<br \/>To address these issues, we present data from stage I-III non-small cell lung cancers and paired non-tumour (NT) tissue obtained at primary surgery from 25 patients enrolled in the TRACERx Study. Using flow cytometry and quantitative T cell receptor sequencing, we demonstrate that NT lung tissues harbour a resident population of V&#948;1 &#947;&#948; T cells, entirely distinct to blood. Compared with NT lung tissues, resident-memory and effector-memory V&#948;1 T cells are enriched in tumours. RNA sequencing revealed that intratumoural V&#948;1 T cells are skewed towards cytolysis and T-helper-1 functions, akin to intratumoural NK and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Importantly, we found no evidence of T-helper-17 skew that has been implicated in tumour promotion in murine models. Ongoing remission after surgery was significantly associated with the presence of CD103<sup>+<\/sup> tissue-resident V&#948;1 T cells in non-malignant lung tissues and the presence of CD45RA<sup>-<\/sup>\/CD27<sup>+<\/sup> effector-memory V&#948;1 T cells in tumours. Moreover, patients with a greater proportion of intratumoural V&#948;1 T cell clones shared with paired NT tissues were more likely to remain in remission, consistent with the cells&#8217; proposed immunosurveillance function in steady state epithelial tissues.<br \/>Whilst immunotherapies modulating &#945;&#946; T cells have been successful for some patients, including those with non-small cell lung cancer, clinical trials of &#947;&#948; T cells have so far demonstrated poor efficacy in solid cancers. These trials have hitherto exclusively utilised V&#948;2 T cells, a subset which is found predominantly in peripheral blood and more commonly associated, albeit still rarely, with IL-17 production. The first-in-human clinical trial of V&#948;1 T cell immunotherapy has just opened for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Thus, our findings have immediate translational relevance and support the utilisation of these as-yet-untapped V&#948;1 T cells in solid cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bbc5b3ec-9369-41b0-a798-5efea3f0dd12\/@w03B8ZRQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gamma-delta lymphocytes,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18670"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yin Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhruva Biswas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ieva Usaite<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelova Mihaela<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Boeing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takahiro Karasaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Selvaraju Veeriah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justyna Czyzewska-Khan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Reading<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Georgiou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maise Al-Bakir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas McGranahan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariam Jamal-Hanjani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allan Hackshaw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>TRACERx Consortium<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergio Quezada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrian Hayday<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Swanton<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although initially effective, many patients fail to maintain durable responses and progress to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer. Commensal bacteria play important role in maintaining homeostasis and proper immune function. However, ADT alters gut bacterial compositions and the ramifications being investigated. In this study, we used a mouse model of <i>Pten<\/i>-deficient prostate cancer to characterize differences in bacterial composition of gut bacteria in mice with castration na&#239;ve-prostate cancer (CNPC) and gut microbiota from mice three and six weeks after treatment ADT via surgical castration representing castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) and CRPC, respectively. Fecal samples were collected and processed for 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing. ADT resulted in significant changes to biological diversity and local diversity was highest in CSPC (Shannon index, <i>P<\/i>=0.04). Community composition also differed significantly different between the groups (Adonis OTU Bray-Curtis, <i>P<\/i>=0.001, NMDS stress=0.07). Despite dissimilarities between bacterial communities among the groups, CNPC and CRPC shared a greater similarity. Taxa associated with CNPC included <i>Unclassified S247, <\/i><i>Prevotella <\/i><i>L. reuteri, <\/i><i>unclassified<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Rikenellaceae <\/i>and <i>u<\/i><i>nclassified Bactero<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>dales<\/i>; taxa associated with CSPC included <i>R. gnavus, Dorea<\/i><i>,<\/i><i> unclassified Desulfovib<\/i><i>ri<\/i><i>onaceae<\/i><i>, Dehalobacterium, A. mucin<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>philia, <\/i><i>Bifidobacterium, and B. producta<\/i>; and taxa associated with CRPC included <i>Turicibacter<\/i>, <i>R. flavefaciens<\/i>, <i>L. garvieae<\/i>, <i>unclassified<\/i> <i>Peptostreptococcaceae <\/i>and <i>unclassified Bacilli<\/i>. Mice with CSPC and CRPC had an increased abundance genes associated with of catabolic metabolic pathways associated with aromatic compound, steroid Benzoate, and toluene degradation as well as genes associated to pathways corresponding to methane metabolism, phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism. Genes enriched in fecal taxa from CNPC and CRPC mice were associated with folate biosynthesis, galactose metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes. This study provides preclinical evidence to support the association between the gut microbiome and prostate cancer phenotypes associated with sensitivity to ADT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d4462e80-7738-40ff-81e2-bed0283ecc19\/@w03B8ZRQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen deprivation therapy,Prostate cancer,Gut microbiota,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18671"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chisato Wakamori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Marco A.

Accurate neoantigen identification is thus critical for designing cancer vaccines and predicting response to immunotherapies. Neoantigen identification and prioritization relies on correctly inferring whether the presenting peptide sequence can successfully induce an immune response. As the majority of somatic mutations are SNVs, changes between wildtype and mutant peptide are subtle and require cautious interpretation. An important, yet underappreciated, variable in neoantigen-prediction pipelines is the mutation position within the peptide relative to its anchor positions for the patient&#8217;s specific HLA alleles. While a subset of peptide positions are presented to the T-cell receptor for recognition, others are responsible for anchoring to the MHC, making these positional considerations critical for predicting T-cell responses. However, a systematic method for determining anchor locations for the wide range of HLA alleles present in the population and application of these to evaluate MT\/WT peptide pairs arising in tumors has not been reported. As a result, many neoantigen studies have either failed to adequately consider this crucial factor or have used conventional assumptions to guide their neoantigen identification process. Here, we provide a computational workflow for predicting anchor locations for a wide range of HLA alleles, using a reference dataset generated from clinical and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient samples. We calculated high probability anchor positions for different peptide lengths for over 300 common HLA alleles. Analysis of these results showed clusters of different anchor trends among the HLA alleles analyzed. A subset of these HLA anchor results were orthogonally validated using protein crystallography structures. Analysis of 923 tumor samples showed that 7-41% of neoantigen candidates were potentially misclassified in the neoantigen selection process and can be rescued using allele-specific knowledge of anchor positions. These anchor predictions are currently undergoing experimental validation using both peptide-MHC stability assays as well as fluorescence-based competition binding assays. By incorporating our anchor prediction results into neoantigen prediction pipelines, such as pVACtools, we hope to formalize and streamline the identification process for relevant clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/43f92f02-8232-4fdc-8298-f6c373fa365d\/@x03B8ZRR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,MHC Anchor,Cancer immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18673"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huiming Xia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua McMichael<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Becker-Hapak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Onyinyechi C.

Sequence variability in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) leads to the presentation of diverse neoantigens to T cells, and accurately representing this diversity in neoantigen prediction is critical for improvement. Previously, we published data from 25 mono-allelic cell lines and built an associated MHC class I, pan-allelic neoantigen prediction algorithm (SHERPATM). Here, we profile an additional 84 MHC alleles including 37 that have never previously been profiled with mono-allelic immunopeptidomics, explore the impact of MHC variability on peptide binding and improve neoantigen prediction of the SHERPA algorithm. To generate the data, we stably and transiently transfected 109 different MHC alleles (43 HLA-A, 56 -B and 10 -C alleles) into independent K562 HLA-null cell lines, immunoprecipitated intact MHC complexes using a W6\/32 antibody and profiled the bound peptides using LC\/MS-MS. We recovered a median of 1430 peptides per allele, with yields from the transient transfections being consistently higher than the stable transfections. Nearly all alleles have a strong anchor residue in the ninth position, but the positions of the secondary anchor residue vary by gene. HLA-B showed a stronger preference for the second position while HLA-A exhibited more variability across the first, second and third positions. In addition to the 109 mono-allelic cell lines, SHERPA increases generalizability by systematically integrating an additional 104 mono-allelic and 384 multi-allelic samples with publicly available immunopeptidomics data. The 186 alleles in the resulting training dataset have an average allelic coverage of 98% across 18 different US-based ethnicities. We evaluated our updated performance on 10% held-out mono-allelic test data from multiple cell line sources. The positive predictive value (PPV) of SHERPA was markedly higher than either NetMHCPan 4.1 or MHCFlurry-2.0 (1.45 and 1.58-fold increase, respectively), with further gains when only the 37 previously unprofiled alleles were considered (1.51 and 1.79-fold increase, respectively). Furthermore, the SHERPA model was able to detect 1.38-fold more immunogenic epitopes than either other method. Finally, we performed predictions with SHERPA across millions of synthetic binding pockets and peptides to elucidate the impact of MHC variability on peptide diversity. We found a strong correlation between binding pocket positions that highly influence peptide binding and those that are evolutionarily divergent. In conclusion, we profiled 109 mono-allelic cell lines, showed key trends in MHC-associated peptides and improved the SHERPA neoantigen prediction model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b9cb4716-80b4-4e9c-9390-6893bb98d55b\/@x03B8ZRR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Mass spectrometry,Machine learning,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18674"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachel Marty Pyke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Dea<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hima Anbunathan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles W.

Although early detection through screening has reduced CRC incidence, the prognosis for metastatic CRC is poor. In the past decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been a major clinical breakthrough with promising clinical benefits in many cancer types, but its efficacy is limited in most (~85%) CRC patients. ICIs preferentially have robust responses from tumors with pre-existing T cell infiltration. However, most CRC lacks robust T-cell infiltration due to immune evasion mechanisms. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize factors shaping immune evasion to improve the response to ICIs. We hypothesize that targeting tumor-cell intrinsic factors can overcome T cell exclusion and will sensitize the tumor to ICIs. To elucidate the factors underlying ICI resistance, it is critical that preclinical models faithfully recapitulate the tumor physiology and genetics of the human disease. Therefore, we developed a tumor organoid (tumoroids) model system adapted from Jacks lab that harbors <i>shApc<\/i>,<i> Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i>, <i>p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>and <i>Smad4<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>(shAKPS) mutations, which are co-mutated with high frequency and associated with poor prognosis. We demonstrated that tumoroids with only <i>shApc<\/i> and<i> Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> mutations can form a solid tumor in two weeks. Addition of <i>p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>and <i>Smad4<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>mutations drives invasiveness and metastasis. The shAKPS tumoroids present key features of advanced CRC that are unresponsive to ICIs including invasive tumor, metastasis, and T cell exclusion. Using CRISPR\/Cas9 screening and integrative immune score analysis, we identified potential immune evasive genes. To define their expression profile in the tumor, we performed TCGA data analysis in fourteen different cancer types. Furthermore, we performed correlation tests to determine their role in immune cell infiltration and T cell dysfunction. Our results show that these immune suppressive genes are overexpressed in tumor tissues, and negatively correlate with CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration. Our findings suggest that overexpression of immune suppressive genes in cancer cells may cause T cell dysfunction and exclusion in tumors. Furthermore, the functional role of these immune suppressive genes will be characterized using shAKPS mutant organoids and in vivo orthotopic CRC tumor models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03b325a1-b29b-4bd6-b002-754f959702b0\/@x03B8ZRR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Organoids,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18675"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dechen Wangmo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xianda Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelo Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Travis Gates<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subree Subramanian<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although CMML is characterized by relatively low genetic complexity consistent with clonal expansion, loss-of-function mutations in ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) protein are frequent and reported in almost 60% of CMML cases. Consistent with this finding, deletion of the Tet2 gene in mice leads to CMML-like disease. TET2 restrains inflammatory signals through various means, for instance by directly suppressing the expression of the IL6 gene in mouse myeloid cells by recruiting histone deacetylases. Conversely, the levels of pre-inflammatory cytokines including IL6 correlate with pre-leukemic proliferation of Tet2-deficient mouse monocytes and other myeloid cells, suggesting that Tet2 deficiency increases IL-6 expression and increased IL-6 expression in turn drives the proliferation of Tet2-deficient myeloid-lineage cells in a positive feedback loop. This scenario may operate in CMML patients, who show increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and increased expression of interferon-induced genes compared to age-matched healthy individuals. To gain insight into the connection between inflammation caused by TET deficiency and monocyte hyperproliferation, we set up cultures of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from inducible TET deficient mice. Using this model, we found that TET-deficient BMDMs show increased proliferation compared to wild type controls; moreover, LPS stimulation leads to significantly increased expression of IL6 and IL1b in TET-deficient BMDMs. Our previous RNA sequencing of expanded TET-deficient myeloid cells in vivo showed that TET deficiency correlated with increased expression of transposable elements (TEs) and induced a DNA damage response, leading us to hypothesize that TET deficiency and increased TE expression may activate DNA and RNA sensing pathways and induce sterile inflammation. I am currently using several molecular approaches to delineate the potential connection of TET deficiency with endogenous inflammation in CMML. There is growing evidence that TET deficiency or non-specific inhibition of TET enzymes in CD8 T cells can potentiate anti-tumor responses. I am<b> <\/b>now asking whether the TET deficiency-inflammation axis I observe in BMDMs might also enhance anti-tumor responses by increasing proinflammatory responses and hence T cell recruitment and anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a71183e1-632d-4f6c-b693-3aa3c8f1ea89\/@x03B8ZRR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Epigenetics,Chronic myelogenous leukemia,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21345"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anup Kumar Singh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atsushi Onodera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hugo Sepulveda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Angel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anjana Rao<\/i><\/presenter>.

A complex tumor microenvironment is one of the leading reasons for a poor prognosis in glioma patients. Microglia, as part of the immune microenvironment of gliomas, may facilitate glioma growth and invasion. However, the correlation between the microglia abundance and glioma prognosis has not been clarified.<br \/>Method: Our goal was to examine the relationship between microglia abundance and glioma prognosis. We analyzed the single-cell RNA sequences of human and mouse glioma cells to identify microglia marker genes. Then, we built a LASSO Cox regression model of microglia abundance signatures in gliomas. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (Low-grade gliomas, LGG) was used as the training cohort. The Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) dataset and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) dataset was used to validate the model as the validation cohorts.<br \/>Findings: Overall survival was significantly lower in those with a high level of microglia infiltration. Additionally, we found that microglia could interact with the tumor microenvironment and genomic features of gliomas, making microglia abundance negatively associated with the prognosis of glioma patients. Microglia abundance was positively correlated with immune genes expression and immune-related pathways. By applying our LASSO Cox regression model to gliomas, we found that patients with high-risk scores had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those with low-risk scores.<br \/>Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggest that microglia abundance may be negatively associated with survival in gliomas. Based on the novel microglia abundance signatures, we developed a high accuracy LASSO Cox regression model. In this study, we demonstrated that the model accurately predicted the prognosis of glioma patients and could offer new therapeutic targets for microglial-directed therapies.<br \/>Keywords: Gliomas; Microglia abundance; LASSO Cox regression; TCGA; Signature.- 1 -","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f74db3d-dadf-4389-9aa0-2fe53e25a70b\/@x03B8ZRR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Microglia abundance,LASSO Cox regression,Signature,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20068"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chongming Jiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evelien Schaafsma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanding Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thinh Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chao Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Ras proteins are membrane-anchored GTPases that participate in multiple signaling cascades regulating crucial cellular processes including cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Ras mutations and\/or deregulated Ras activities frequently lead to inflammation and malignant transformation. Recent studies have also shown that Ras mutations are associated with immuno-resistance by positive regulation of PD-L1 expression. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases 1 (IDO1) is a heme-containing enzyme that catalyzes the rate limiting step of conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine (Kyn). Extensive research in the past has shown that IDO1 and its catalytic product Kyn mediate immune tolerance, thus promoting tumorigenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>. IDO1 expression is activated by immune cytokines including interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;)and interleukin-6 (IL-6). However, whether there is a mechanistic link between oncogenic KRas and IDO1 expression and how IDO1 expression contributes to immune invasion of transformed cells with KRas mutations remain unclear. Here we report that oncogenic KRas significantly enhanced IFN-&#947;-induced IDO1 expression. In H358 lung carcinoma cells, IDO1 expression induced by IFN-&#947; was at least in part dependent on ERK activation, and treatment with ARS-1620, a covalent KRas<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor, suppressed IDO1 expression induced by IFN-&#947; in a concentration-dependent manner. IDO1 expression was also induced by IFN-&#947; in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells that harbored a KRas<sup>G12D <\/sup>mutant allele, but not in HCT116 cells with wild-type KRas, suggesting that IFN-&#947; induced IDO1 expression requires Ras activation. In addition, KRas downregulation by specific siRNAs decreased IFN-&#947;-induced IDO1 expression in A549 lung cancer cells. Taken together, our study strongly suggests that Ras\/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in promoting IDO1 expression induced by IFN-&#947;.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dcdb4fd1-e1f2-420d-b6d1-ecd8b4666ac0\/@x03B8ZRR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IDO1,KRAS,Tumor immunity,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20406"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eunji Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felicia He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byeong Hyeok Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Dai<\/i><\/presenter>.

In particular, up to 40% of AML relapses display complete loss of surface expression of HLA class II molecules without any genetic lesion explaining this phenotype (<i>Christopher et al, N Engl J Med, 2018<\/i>; <i>Toffalori et al, Nat Med, 2019<\/i>). This led us to investigate the links between epigenetic changes, immune evasion and post-transplantation relapse.<br \/>Methods: Starting from primary AML samples pairwise collected from five patients at diagnosis and relapse with non-genomic loss of HLA class II expression, we generated Patients-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) into NOD-SCID &#947;-chain null mice. Leukemic cells expanded in the mice and their original human counterparts were characterized for changes in gene expression (by RNA-Seq), DNA methylation profile (by RRBS), and chromatin accessibility (by ATAC-Seq). The results obtained by all these approaches and in the different patients were integrated by Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Finally, we tested the immunological effects of epigenetic drugs on AML cells and on their recognition by T cells in ex-vivo short-term cultures and in PDXs.<br \/>Results: We verified that PDXs faithfully recapitulate immune-related differences between AML diagnosis and post-transplantation relapse, including loss of expression of HLA class II molecules. Differences between diagnosis and post-transplantation relapse samples were mostly explained by changes in chromatin accessibility, and largely unrelated to the DNA methylation profile. In particular, in all five patients analyzed, we documented genomewide chromatin compaction at time of relapse, that was particularly evident for HLA class II genes and their master regulator CIITA, and not detected in relapses after sole chemotherapy. Integration of all the high-throughput technologies by MOFA, and of results from different patients by GSEA, pointed to the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) as the main candidate mediator of HLA class II silencing.Pharmacological inhibition of PRC2 subunits rescued HLA class II expression in AML relapses <i>ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, with consequent recovery of leukemia recognition by CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results uncover a novel link between epigenetics and leukemia immune escape, which may rapidly translate into innovative strategies to cure or prevent AML post-transplantation relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Post-Transplantation Relapse,HLA,Epigenetic Silencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21150"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Valentina Gambacorta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefano Beretta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Ciccimarra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Zito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kety Giannetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Andrisani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniela Gnani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucia Zanotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giacomo Oliveira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo G.
