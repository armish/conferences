Apoptosis is a form of regulated cell death initiated by either the extracellular environment (extrinsic) or following internal cellular damage (intrinsic). It is controlled by the BCL-2 family which includes anti-apoptotic regulators like BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 that bind and sequester various pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (BIM, BAD, BID, NOXA, PUMA, etc.), and the pro-apoptotic effectors (BAK, BAX, etc.) responsible for mitochondrial pore formation and MOMP (mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization). MOMP results in intermembrane space protein release, leading to caspase activation in an irreversible path to programmed cell death. Of the anti-apoptotic regulators, MCL-1 is one of the most frequently and highly amplified genes in human cancers such as myeloid leukemia making it a compelling therapeutic target.<sup> <\/sup>Since BCL-2 proteins interact through protein-protein interactions, they have long been elusive targets. The success of selective BCL-2 protein inhibitor Venetoclax in the treatment of various hematological cancers, however spurred interest in MCL-1 as an oncology target. Using structure-based drug design, major breakthroughs were made in the development of MCL-1 inhibitors, with several candidates entering clinical studies in the past five years. JNJ-4355, a highly potent 1,4-indolyl macrocycle (MCL-1 K<sub>i<\/sub> = 18 pM, Cell (MOLP8) AC<sub>50<\/sub> = 8.7 nM) was optimized to address shortcomings from first generation MCL-1 inhibitors: it has improved physicochemical properties (CHI LogD<sub>7.4<\/sub> = 2.35, EPSA = 151 &#197;<sup>2<\/sup>), resulting in greatly improved equilibrium solubility (3.14 mM in buffer pH 7) and reduced protein binding (99.93%). JNJ-4355 showed promising in vitro potency data in cancer cell lines and AML patient-derived samples (cell killing AC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.29-75 nM in 25\/27 evaluable samples). In vivo MCL-1:BAK complex disruption was confirmed in a mouse MOLM13 (AML) xenograft. Efficacy was demonstrated in a mouse MOLP8 (multiple myeloma) xenograft resulting in complete tumor regression after a single IV dose of JNJ-4355.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Lead optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mcl-1,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Multiple myeloma,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Frederik J.

This complex formation induces apoptosis in cancer cells expressing elevated levels of PDE3A and SLFN12 (de Waal et al., Nat Chem Biol 2016; Wu et al., J Bio Chem 2020). Unlike traditional targeted therapies that leverage dependencies created by genomic alterations in cancer cells, velcrins instead kill cancer cells by a gain-of-function mechanism dependent on stimulation of SLFN12 RNase activity by complex formation with PDE3A (Garvie et al., Nat Commun 2021).<br \/>Based on in-vivo tool compounds which were discovered by hit-to-lead optimization from a phenotypic screen (Lewis et al., ACS Med Chem Lett 2019), the team set out to optimize the properties of the tool compounds. While already showing excellent potency and in-vivo efficacy in various tumor models, the compounds were only approximately tenfold selective against PDE3A when compared to their cell killing activity. PDE3A\/B activity most notably influences cardiohemodynamics and inhibition of PDE3A\/B was to be reduced to generate a larger safety window. Co-crystallization of analogs with PDE3A showed the binding mode of the velcrin class and changes in the solvent exposed region of the PDE3A binders led to steep activity changes in complex formation and cell killing. Careful optimization of the ratio of cell killing to PDE3A activity while optimizing DMPK and safety pharmacology led to the discovery of BAY 2666605.<br \/>BAY 2666605 has recently entered a First-in-Human study (NCT04809805) in patients with advanced solid tumors that co-express PDE3A and SLFN12, including melanoma, ovarian cancer, and sarcoma. We will discuss the discovery and structure activity relationships of BAY 2666605.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Lead optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,Biomarkers,Molecular targets,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stefan Gradl<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

N-Myc, encoded by <i>MYCN<\/i>, is a highly attractive yet &#8220;undruggable&#8221; target in neuroblastoma drug discovery. N-Myc is a short-lived protein in normal neuronal progenitor cells; however, in <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified neuroblastoma cells, overexpressed N-Myc is stabilized by high levels of Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A). Several Aurora-A allosteric modulators have been developed to disassociate N-Myc binding and promote its degradation. These compounds function through a competitive mechanism against N-Myc, and clinical trial results suggest limited efficacy in high-risk neuroblastoma patients where N-Myc is highly expressed. To develop Aurora-A modulators with greater effects in destabilizing N-Myc, targeted degradation of Aurora-A was investigated in this study. First, we developed a highly selective Aurora-A-binding ligand by chemically modifying ribociclib, which targets CDK4\/6. Next, a series of potent Aurora-A\/N-Myc degraders were developed using proteolysis targeting chimaera (PROTAC) technology. Our lead compound, HLB-0532259, was found to substantially decrease N-Myc levels in neuroblastoma cells following the degradation of Aurora-A with nanomolar potency. Mechanistic studies suggest that HLB-0532259 binds to Aurora-A in an uncompetitive manner with respect to N-Myc, which contributes to its high potency for degrading the Aurora-A\/N-Myc pool. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrates that HLB-0532259 possesses remarkable proteome-wide selectivity for Aurora-A and N-Myc degradation. Further studies have revealed that HLB-0532259 exhibits nanomolar cytotoxicities against a panel of <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified neuroblastoma cells, good pharmacokinetic properties, and favorable therapeutic outcomes in a xenograft neuroblastoma mouse model. Taken together, our data strongly support HLB-0532259 as a promising lead compound for neuroblastoma therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Aurora kinase A,N-Myc,Proteolysis targeting chimaeras ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jian Tang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramkumar Moorthy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ozlem Demir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary D.

A key milestone in structure-based drug design is compound binding site identification and characterization. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies utilize techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), x-ray crystallography (X-ray), cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and the mass spectrometry-based hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) to address these hurdles but they are labor, time and cost intensive. Further, SAR studies are often complicated by protein size (i.e. large proteins) and location (i.e. membrane proteins), which can lead to protocol adaptations (e.g. recombinant protein usage and\/or protein truncation) that can introduce artifacts. Using limited proteolysis (LiP) coupled to next-generation mass spectrometry we have developed a high-throughput, high-resolution approach (HR-LiP) that utilizes peptide-level resolution to characterize drug-protein interactions including for proteins that hindered by the previously mentioned limitations.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To boost protein abundance in their native environment, proteins of interest were overexpressed in HEK293 cells using a simple plasmid construct. Cell lysates were incubated with the compounds of interest at increasing concentrations. Samples were then subjected to a limited digest using proteinase K and further processed for data independent acquisition (DIA)-MS analysis using trypsin. Data was analyzed using a directDIA workflow in Spectronaut.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Two well-characterized drug target proteins, bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), were selected for analysis. Using HR-LiP we identify the binding site of the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 in the full-length protein, which is typically too large to be used directly in with conventional methods. Further, we map the intracellular binding location of both gefitinib and afatinib, two inhibitors of the membrane protein EGFR. Our data for both proteins are in good accordance with orthogonal data obtained by HDX-MS, NMR and X-ray studies.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We demonstrate that HR-LiP can be used to dissect small molecule-protein binding events, including compound binding site prediction for protein targets classically considered to be difficult. Given its biological power, broad applicability and ease of implementation, we envision the use of HR-LiP as a routine approach for target validation and lead optimization in small molecule drug discovery pipelines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Lead optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Structure-activity relationships,Proteomics,Drug discovery,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Nigel Beaton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jagat Adhikari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roland Bruderer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ron Tomlinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yuehan Feng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Cornella-Taracido<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukas Reiter<\/i><\/presenter>.

The main obstacle preventing development of more effective glioblastoma therapies is the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB), which prevents the majority of anticancer drugs from penetrating intracranial tumor tissue at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Our new anti-glioblastoma therapeutic approach is based on the previously reported anti-glioblastoma activity of a common lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate (FF). FF kills glioblastoma cells by direct interaction of unprocessed form of FF (ester) with mitochondrial membranes. This interaction leads to the severe inhibition of mitochondrial respiration which in consequence triggers depletion of intracellular ATP followed by extensive glioblastoma cell death. However, FF does not cross the BBB and its anti-glioblastoma effects can be attenuated by the elevated glucose content (4.5g\/L). Therefore, we have designed and synthesized over 80 new metabolic compounds based on the FF skeletal structure, benzyl-phenoxy-acetamide (BPA). Two of the compounds, PP21 and PP23, have physicochemical parameters that indicate high potential for improved BBB penetration [water solubility (logS), lipophilicity (ClogP), blood-brain partitioning (logBB), and Central Nervous System - Multiparameter Optimization (MPO-CNS) algorithm]. We have also confirmed that the compounds can effectively cross the triple coculture BBB model membranes. Importantly, PP21 and PP23 are over 30-fold more effective in killing glioblastoma cells compared to FF (PP21 IC50 = 1.24 &#956;M, and PP23 IC50 = 0.57 &#956;M) when tested in low glucose environment (1g\/L). Similar to FF, the compounds block mitochondrial respiration, which is followed by an immediate increase of glycolysis. In consequence, glucose is quickly depleted leading to a severe decline of intracellular ATP, activation of AMPK, activation of autophagy, and ultimately, glioblastoma cell death. To improve PP21\/PP23 anti-glioblastoma effects in a high glucose environment, we have tested multiple glycolysis inhibitors, and demonstrated that lonidamine and gnetin H (resveratrol trimer), synergize with PP21-induced cytotoxicity in both low and high glucose media. In summary, we have developed a new class of metabolic compounds with improved BBB penetration that can effectively eliminate glioblastoma cells in synergy with the selected glycolysis inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Glioblastoma,Mitochondria,Drug design,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Krzysztof Reiss<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Lassak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Ingraham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanna Stalinska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrice Penfornis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Flavia DeCarlo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed Ali Ibraham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pier Paolo Claudio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Branko Jursic<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our unique chemical protein synthesis and engineering platform allows us to fine-tune cytokines and other proteins to interrogate and modulate biological functions by incorporating new functional modifications. Standard recombinant bacterial or cellular expression systems used to produce proteins are largely restricted to using canonical amino acids, which limits access to diverse modifications that can bestow additional functional properties. With chemical protein synthesis technology, canonical and non-canonical modifications including conjugation handles can be easily introduced, ultimately enabling a medicinal chemistry approach for engineering cytokine structures. Enhanced cytokines with differentiated biology developed using this approach can be further elaborated by conjugating to a diverse array of molecules.<br \/>We first applied our technology platform to identify BPT-143, a rationally designed enhanced IL-2 variant currently in IND-enabling studies. BPT-143 is engineered to have enhanced binding to IL2R&#946; and no binding to IL2R&#945; for improved efficacy and safety independent of the conjugation to a half-life extending 30 kDa PEG. The chemical synthesis technology is robust, reproducible, and scalable. We are applying our platform to enhance a number of other cytokines for use in immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases.<br \/>Additionally, our synthetically engineered cytokines can be easily conjugated to monoclonal antibodies as &#8216;payloads&#8217; using a distinct chemical conjugation technology. A rapid and simple chemical process allows site-selective conjugation of our engineered cytokines to existing antibodies &#8216;as-is&#8217; to generate novel immunocytokines (IC). This &#8216;off-the-shelf&#8217; approach is orthogonal to recombinant fusion methods to create ICs and does not require complex recombinant protein expression optimization and lengthy cell-line development. Moreover, it allows rapid screening of cytokine payloads in a structure-activity relationship (SAR) format to identify dual-targeting ICs with precisely tailored properties to generate the desired biological effect. We have prepared a number of ICs including anti-PD-1\/IL-2 ICs with various drug-antibody ratio (DAR) and conjugation sites within the antibody. We will provide an overview of the platform technology and present highlights of its application for discovery and development of designer therapeutic cytokines and ICs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Synthesis,Immunocytokines,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Vijaya R.
