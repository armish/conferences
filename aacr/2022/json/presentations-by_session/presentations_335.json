[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Overexpression of breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) in patients with prostate cancer is associated with a high Gleason score at diagnosis, poorly differentiated tumors, poor prognosis, and disease recurrence. Such aggressive tumors possess high iron storage which promotes inflammation, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation. Expression of iron progressively increases with cancer grade and stage.<br \/><b>Purpose<\/b>: This study evaluated the expression of BRCA2 protein and Iron expression in Gleason&#8217;s graded prostate cancer tissues, in a bid to determine the disease aggressiveness and mortality risk among Southern Nigerian men.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: In this retrospective study, 86 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate cancer tissues (diagnosed in 2018 and 2019) were reviewed using Gleason&#8217;s grading system. Tissues stained for iron and BRCA2 proteins using histochemical and immunohistochemical staining techniques, respectively. Staining intensity was scored using a scale of 0, +1, +2, and +3. For BRCA2 and Iron expressions, score 0 and +1 were considered negative while score +2 and +3 were considered positive. Pearson&#8217;s chi-square test was used to determine the association between Gleason&#8217;s grade and expression of BRCA2 and iron.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The prevalence of prostate cancer in the age groups of 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, and 90-99 years was 10.8%, 32.4%, 40.5%, 13.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Using the Gleason&#8217;s grading pattern, the frequency of Grade (mean age in years) I, II, III, IV and V was 9.3% (70.25 &#177; 6.95), 16.3% (77.29 &#177; 6.23), 16.3% (75.57 &#177; 12.59), 25.6% (72.75 &#177; 7.80) and 32.6% (67.42 &#177; 9.76), respectively. Higher frequency of BRCA2 and Iron expression were observed in &#8805;G4 (37.5% and 72.7%) than in &#8804;G3 (versus 16.7% and 11.8%) at p= 0.191 and p&#60; 0.001, respectively. The prevalence of BRCA2 negative and positive tissues was 65.1% and 34.9%, respectively whereas the prevalence of iron negative and positive tissues was 48.7% and 51.3%, respectively. There was an inverse relationship between tumour grade and age (p= 0.108), and direct relationships between tumour grade and BRCA2 (p= 0.059), tumour grade and iron (p= 0.000), BRCA2 and Iron expressions (p= 0.027), BRCA2 expression and age (p= 0.019), and Iron and age (p= 0.281). Patients with prostate cancer who are within the age group of 50-59 years and those with &#8805;G4 require close monitoring for improved survival.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study revealed a high prevalence of aggressive prostate cancer and suggests that there is a high mortality risk among Southern Nigerian men diagnosed with the disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b61e57a-e664-40ec-9662-157c7c04c7fd\/@u03B8ZCL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-20 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,BRCA2,Iron,Mortality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13479"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jude O.

Standard treatments for advanced stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the most common type, include (1) primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or (2) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with interval debulking surgery. Patients in whom PCS is unlikely to yield optimal cytoreduction to no visible residual disease (R0) or who have medical contraindications to PCS are recommended to undergo NACT. Previous studies on associations between environmental factors and risk of any macroscopic residual disease have yielded inconsistent results. We aimed to (1) comprehensively examine the associations between demographic, lifestyle and reproductive factors and risk of residual disease after PCS; and (2) develop and internally validate a risk prediction model based on these factors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We used pooled data on 3,492 women who had PCS following a diagnosis with advanced stage high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. Fifteen exposures of interest included age at diagnosis, menopausal status, race\/ethnicity, education level, first-degree family history of ovarian cancer, endometriosis, smoking, body mass index, parity, incomplete pregnancy, tubal ligation, use of combined oral contraceptives, depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate, estrogen (ET), and combined estrogen-progestin therapy. We fit logistic regression models to examine each exposure-residual disease association in 80% of the data (n=2,794; random selection of participants). We developed a risk prediction model including the factors with p-values &#8804;0.2. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the model&#8217;s discrimination in the remaining 20% of the data (n=698).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of the 3,492 participants, 2,003 (57%) had residual disease following PCS. Older age at diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of residual disease (OR=1.07 per five years, 95% CI 1.03-1.11). In contrast, a family history of ovarian cancer (OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.42-0.95) or ET use for 5+ years (OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.96) were associated with achieving R0. These above factors were included in the risk prediction model as were race\/ethnicity, personal history of endometriosis, and smoking, whose p-values &#8804;0.2. The model showed modest performance in the validation set (AUC=0.64).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Younger age at diagnosis, family history of ovarian cancer, and long-term ET use were associated with achieving R0 following PCS.

In this nested case-control study of 1651 breast cancer cases and 1651 matched controls from the Nurses&#8217; Health Study (NHS) and the Nurses&#8217; Health Study II (NHSII), we selected lipids and polar metabolites correlated with BMI, waist circumference, weight change since age 18, or derived fat mass, developed a metabolomic score for each measure using LASSO regression, and used logistic regression to investigate the association between this score and breast cancer risk adjusted for risk factors. Analyses were stratified by menopausal status at blood draw and diagnosis. We further explored risk of ER+ and ER- breast cancer.Metabolite correlations were similar across adiposity measures. Metabolite scores developed among only premenopausal or postmenopausal women were highly correlated with scores developed in all women (r=0.94-0.96). Higher metabolomic adiposity scores were generally inversely related to breast cancer risk among premenopausal women. Among postmenopausal women, significant positive trends with risk were observed for higher metabolomic adiposity scores (e.g., metabolomic waist circumference score OR Q4 v. Q1=1.55, 95% CI=1.08-2.22, p-trend=0.01). Metabolites associated with adiposity and breast cancer risk, glycerophosphocholines and branched-chain amino acids, are also associated with metabolic dysregulation. The same metabolites represented adiposity in pre- and postmenopausal women, though breast cancer risk associations still differed by menopausal status. Thus, metabolic dysregulation may have a differential association with pre- vs. postmenopausal breast cancer. Investigation of these metabolites and their role in adiposity-related breast cancer risk should be further explored.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d1a75e2c-1004-46e2-bbe2-5b96c036c82d\/@u03B8ZCL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Risk factors,Body size,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13425"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kristen D.

These findings present a paradox in the traditional expectations of telomere dynamics in cancer development, as longer telomeres are generally considered to be reflective of less advanced age and greater genomic stability. We posited that longer LTL may reflect or lead to delayed cellular senescence allowing cells to accumulate genomic abnormalities that drive lung carcinogenesis. Furthermore, increased copy number of Alu retroelements, repetitive mobile DNA sequences that are approximately 300 base pairs in length, could also reflect genomic instability. We previously found that exposure to diesel exhaust, a known lung carcinogen, was associated with increased Alu copy number and suspect that increased Alu retrotransposition could influence lung carcinogenesis. However, the interrelationship between Alu retroelements, LTL, and lung cancer is unknown. Therefore, we investigated associations between Alu copy number, LTL, and lung cancer risk in the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.<br \/>We conducted a nested case-control study of 410 confirmed incident lung cancer cases and 416 controls individually matched on age, sex, race\/ethnicity, study center, and blood draw date. Quantitative PCR was used to measure Alu copy number and telomere length relative to albumin (Alb) copy number (Alu\/Alb and T\/S ratio, respectively) in pre-diagnostic leukocytes. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate associations between quartiles (Q) of Alu\/Alb ratio (reference=Q1) and lung cancer risk, adjusted for matching factors, smoking status and packyears, and LTL. Additionally, we dichotomized Alu\/Alb ratio and LTL at their medians and created a cross-combination variable to assess combined effects.<br \/>We found a positive dose-response relationship between Alu\/Alb ratio and lung cancer risk (odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI): Q2: 1.34 (0.73, 2.48); Q3:1.89 (0.94, 3.84); Q4: 2.66 (1.03, 5.63); p-trend<sub>ordinal<\/sub>=0.02). The association was apparent for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (Q2: 1.32 (0.46, 3.77); Q3: 2.88 (0.90, 9.25); Q4: 5.07 (1.29, 19.87); p-trend<sub>ordinal<\/sub>=0.02). We have previously reported that longer measured LTL was also associated with an increased risk of LUAD (Q4: 2.82 (1.16-6.85); p-trend=0.011). The combined effect of both a higher Alu\/Alb ratio and longer LTL was 6.07 (1.75, 21.04; p=4.5x10<sup>-3<\/sup>) for LUAD compared with lower\/shorter levels of both.<br \/>Higher Alu copy number and longer LTL were associated with increased risk of lung cancer, especially LUAD. Our findings require replication. If confirmed, evaluation of Alu copy number and LTL in risk stratification and prediction analyses is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/445cd710-1210-4cb2-845b-e44a985c0ba4\/@u03B8ZCL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Adenocarcinoma,Telomeres,Copy number alterations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13432"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason Yat-Yang Wong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Cawthon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Somayina Ezennia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shahinaz Gadalla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Breeze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Batel Blechter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neal Freedman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen-Yi Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>H.

About 7.4% of women who have been diagnosed with primary breast cancer will have a second primary breast cancer within 10 years. This study builds a prediction model for second breast cancer for women who have had primary breast cancer. Readily available cancer registry data with machine learning methods for classification are employed. The best-performing model is selected based on the area under the receiver operator curve, and the key characteristics contributing to a high risk for second breast cancer are identified based on the prediction model. Using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with limited patient features we find an area under the curve of 0.65-0.70 for the testing set. Among the most important features are days from incidence to treatment, size of primary tumor based on the pathology report, and oestrogen receptor status.This research is a step towards the development of a tool that will help doctors identify women very likely to develop second breast cancer, which will prioritize their follow-up or inform their course of treatment depending on their characteristics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f36d9e4c-598b-4f9d-8c7a-8d2e1f2223a0\/@u03B8ZCL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-20 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Machine learning,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13482"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Eleni Syleouni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nena Karavasiloglou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Manduchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miriam Wanner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dimitri Korol<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Rohrmann,<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, discovery of novel, non-invasive early detection biomarkers has high potential to improve survival. Here, we identified plasma metabolomic profiles associated with early-stage and late-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most common histotype.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>We examined 197 lipid and lipid-related metabolites measured using a validated, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) in plasma collected prior to surgery from 40 early-stage and 40 late-stage HGSOC patients and 40 population-based controls matched on age, year, and menopausal status at blood draw. We used multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for matching factors, tubal ligation, oral contraceptive use, and parity, to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of ovarian cancer risk per 1 standard deviation increase in probit-transformed metabolite levels. We used Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) to identify metabolite groups. We accounted for testing multiple correlated hypotheses using the number of effective tests (NEF) or false discovery rate (FDR).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Compared to controls,<b> <\/b>there were 34 metabolites associated with early-stage HGSOC and 88 metabolites associate with late-stage HGSOC (unadjusted p-value&#60;0.05). All metabolites associated with risk of early-stage HGSOC and majority (n=80, 90%) of the metabolites associated with risk of late-stage HGSOC were inversely associated with ORs ranging from 0.28 to 0.48 for early-stage and 0.08 to 0.59 for late-stage HGSOC. Interestingly, the direction of association across all these metabolites were similar in both early-stage and late-stage HGSOC, with stronger effect estimates for late-stage HGSOC. After multiple testing correction, there were 9 statistically significant metabolites associated with risk of late-stage HGSOC (NEF p-value&#60;0.05) whereas no individual metabolites remained associated with risk of early-stage HGSOC. MSEA revealed similar patterns of association compared to controls across the 11 lipid groups assessed in early and late-stage HGSOC cases. Metabolite groups of phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens and triglycerides were inversely associated with early-stage HGSOC compared to controls (FDR p-value&#60;0.05). Metabolite groups of phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens and phosphatidylcholines were inversely, and diglycerides were positively associated with late-stage HGSOC compared to controls (FDR p-value&#60;0.05).<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our results revealed early-stage and late-stage HGSOC having similar plasma metabolomic profiles overall although there were more metabolites that were significantly associated with late-stage HGSOC than early-stage HGSOC compared to population-based controls.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2ccd28d7-2d87-453d-a7bd-b6059b3a38b3\/@u03B8ZCL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Metabolomics,Early detection,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13430"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Naoko Sasamoto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oana A.

Given the high burden of disease in this population, there is an increasing need to improve the understanding of lung cancer. Current risk models for lung cancer focus on active smokers and individuals of European ancestry. Therefore, we developed statistical models by integrating genetic and environmental risk factors to estimate absolute and population attribute risk of lung cancer among never-smoking women in Asia.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We built absolute risk models for lung cancer among never-smoking women using data from 71,300 women (760 incident cases) in the Shanghai Women&#8217;s Health Study (SWHS), a population-based prospective cohort study. Relative risks were estimated using a multivariable Cox regression model with questionnaire-based risk factors. To account for missing genetic data for some subjects, we simulated genotypes for 10 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) using information on minor allele frequencies (MAF) and odds ratio estimates from previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS), conditional on family history of lung cancer. We used the iCARE tool to build two models for predicting lifetime (40 years) and 6-year absolute risk of lung cancer using age-specific lung cancer incidence rates, age-specific competing mortality rates, and risk factor distribution with: 1) questionnaire-based risk factors only and 2) questionnaire and genetic data. We then used the full absolute risk model to estimate the population attributable risk (PAR) due to modifiable risk factors, namely coal use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The questionnaire-based only model included family history of lung cancer, coal use, exposure to ETS, and body mass index (BMI). The full model also included data on 10 lung cancer related SNPs from our previous GWAS and had a wider spread in distribution of absolute lifetime risk (median=2.41%; range=0.43-12.36) compared to the questionnaire-based only model (median=2.72%; range=1.93-4.87). We used the full model to estimate the PAR and found that 1.74% and 6.33% of lung cancer cases could be prevented if never-smoking women in Shanghai did not use coal and were not exposed to ETS, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the full model estimated that 2.5% of the study population had a 6-year absolute risk of lung cancer higher than 1.51%, which is the suggested risk threshold for screening by existing risk models.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We built risk models for never-smoking Asian women and estimated the contribution of coal use and ETS to the burden of lung cancer in Shanghai. This initial work shows promise for expanding and validating risk models in this population with potential translational implications, such as providing insight to identifying high risk individuals that may be eligible for lung cancer screening and primary prevention efforts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2119c099-5788-42c8-8173-790495ef262f\/@v03B8ZCM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-20 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Modeling,Genetic susceptibility,Environmental exposure,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13476"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Batel Blechter<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Parichoy Pal Choudhury<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao-ou Shu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiuyin Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gong Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Y.Y.

We measured Alu copy number in 107 incident NHL cases and 1:1 matched controls (&#177; 5 years age). DNA samples extracted from blood were assayed in triplicate using a monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We used the albumin gene for the single copy gene to control for genome content in samples. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all NHL were estimated using conditional logistic regression models, adjusting for age at randomization, number of cigarettes smoked per day and smoking duration. Polytomous logistic regression models were fit to compute ORs with Alu copy number for NHL subtypes.

However, robust validation of such models in prospective cohort studies is needed to determine their accuracy in identifying women at different risk levels.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We incorporated Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) breast density to a literature-based model with questionnaire-based risk factors and a 313-variant polygenic risk score (PRS). The Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimator (iCARE) tool was used to build and validate a 5-year absolute risk model for breast cancer. The model was evaluated for calibration and discrimination in three prospective cohorts of women of European ancestry (1,468 cases, 19,104 controls): US-based Nurses&#8217; Health Study (NHS I and II) and Mayo Mammography Health Study (MMHS); and Sweden-based Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (KARMA) study. Analyses were done separately for women younger (NHS II, KARMA) and older than 50 years (NHS I, MMHS, KARMA). Improvements in risk stratification were assessed among US non-Hispanic White women aged 50-70 years.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> For women younger than 50 years, the model with questionnaire-based risk factors, PRS and BI-RADS was well calibrated across risk deciles in NHS II, but overestimated risk at the highest risk decile in KARMA. For women 50 years or older, the model showed good calibration in all studies, with evidence of slight overestimation at the highest risk decile and underestimation at the lowest risk decile. The model with PRS and BI-RADS was well calibrated for women at high-risk in both age groups. Incorporation of BI-RADS to questionnaire-based risk factors and PRS improved risk discrimination: area under the curves (AUC) 67.0% (95% CI: 63.5-70.6%) vs. 65.6% (95% CI: 61.9-69.3%) for models with and without BI-RADS for younger women and 66.1% (95% CI 64.4-67.8%) vs. 65.5% (95% CI: 63.8-67.2%) for older women. The model with BI-RADS identified 18.4% population of non-Hispanic US women 50-70 years old above 3% 5-year risk (used for recommending risk-reducing medication in the US), with 42.4% of future cases expected to occur in this group. Addition of BI-RADS led to the reclassification of ~8.0% of US non-Hispanic White women aged 50-70 years at the high-risk threshold (3% 5-year risk), resulting in identification of 4.2% of additional future cases.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Integrating BI-RADS with questionnaire-based risk factors and PRS resulted in improved risk stratification among women of European ancestry, with evidence of slight overestimation of risk for women at elevated risk.

Some of trends has been associated with exposure of chemically reactive compounds derived from exogenous or endogenous sources and genetic deficiencies in DNA repair and DNA replication as mutational signatures. Accumulation of these information will ultimately expect to identify carcinogenic etiologies in an individual case. However, what types of DNA damage caused the mutational signatures and how extent they contribute to human carcinogenesis has not yet fully explained.To directly evaluate the chemical types of DNA damage in human colorectal tissues, we performed comprehensive identification of DNA adducts by a liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. In this DNA adductome methodology, genome DNA was enzymatically hydrolyzed into mononucleoside and separated using a reversed-phase chromatography. Chemical structure of DNA adducts including products of epigenetic modification in genome DNA was identified using column retention time and <i>m\/z<\/i> of chemical standard library of DNA adducts. Peak areas of DNA adducts were normalized by that of naturally-occurring isotopologues of canonical DNA nucleoside and compared with clinicopathological information. We identified several DNA adducts in human colorectal tissue. These included DNA adducts of alkylation, oxidation, and lipid peroxidation. C5-methyl-2&#8217;-deoxycytidine was most abundant atypical DNA in human colorectal tissue and prevalent in all cases. C5-hydroxymethyl-2&#8217;-deoxycytdine was decreased in colorectal cancer cases compared with non-colorectal cancer cases. Other DNA adducts like 1,N6-etheno-2&#8217;-deoxyadenosine were present with group- or individual-specificity. Compared with our previous results of DNA adductome analysis in human stomach mucosae and kidney tissues, DNA adducts observed in human colorectal tissue showed some tissue specificity. We will discuss whether profiles of DNA adducts are based on similar contexts of chemical exposure among individuals. DNA adducts observed in our study potentially indicated chemical causes of DNA mutation in human colorectal tissue. We propose that the integration of DNA adductomics using mass spectrometric profiling with other genetic analysis such as mutational signature analysis leverage the exploration of chemical and genetic etiology in an individual carcinogenic context and evaluate gene-environment interaction in human carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/67619502-d74b-4797-a599-a2146960814e\/@v03B8ZCM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA adducts,Carcinogenesis,Human,Mass spectrometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13431"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuji Iwashita<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunsuke Ohtsuka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ippei Ohnishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuto Matsushita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Yamashita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keisuke Inaba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atsuko Fukazawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideto Ochiai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keigo Matsumoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nobuhito Kurono<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshitaka Matsushima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroki Mori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shioto Suzuki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shohachi Suzuki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fumihiko Tanioka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haruhiko Sugimura<\/i><\/presenter>.

The distinctions between MGUS, SMM, and MM rely on clinical values with inherent variation relating to tumor burden quantified from bone marrow biopsies, a measure subject to inconsistencies in location, timing, and pathologist interpretation. These challenges limit the potential of current standardized risk criteria and advocate for models that examine precursor disease kinetics. We thus developed a risk model that leverages dynamic changes in markers of precursor disease to improve clinical ability to predict time to disease progression.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To model the evolution of progression risk, we built PANGEA, an international retrospective cohort of precursor patients with baseline and serial time points of clinical and biological variables. This cohort comprises 1095 SMM patients, 254 (23%) of which progressed to MM. Using this cohort, we modeled progression to MM with Cox regression using time-dependent and continuous clinical variables. The model was trained on a subset of data restricted to patients of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and validated its performance by computing the c-statistic in a sub-cohort independent from the DFCI training cohort.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The PANGEA cohort was first used to validate current models of SMM disease progression. We validated the 20\/2\/20 International Myeloma Working Group criteria for SMM patients using binary cutoffs of initial measurements (baseline model), and then extended this model, allowing for re-stratification by the 20\/2\/20 criteria over time (dynamic model). We then assessed whether rates of change in a set of myeloma-specific clinical variables unrestricted to those of the 20\/2\/20 criteria improved the predictive ability of the model. This improved our progression prediction as indicated by a c-statistic increase of more than 10% with respect to both 20\/2\/20 models (baseline and dynamic). Specifically, changes in disease indicators such as age and creatinine are highly predictive of imminent disease progression (p-value &#38;lt; 0.01). Finally, we clustered patients based on latent trajectories of these time-varying clinical variables and included the trajectory classes in the Cox regression. The resulting multivariable, dynamic algorithm is a dramatic improvement over current clinical standards in predicting progression from SMM to MM disease.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The PANGEA multivariable algorithm&#8217;s use of continuous clinical variables enhances progression risk predictions in SMM. These findings demonstrate that disease progression from SMM to MM, which likely occurs by the acquisition of sequential changes to the plasma cell clone, can be tracked by trends in clinical values, thus improving prognostication for precursor patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/96a76dc1-2ffa-4a54-97a9-d04c4ce2ddcb\/@v03B8ZCM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-20 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Statistical approach,Cancer progression,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13478"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Annie Cowan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Habib El-Khoury<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federico Ferrari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel S.

A polygenic risk score (PRS) for hepatic fat derived from non-Asians has been reported to be associated with HCC risk in European populations. However, population level data of this risk in non-European populations are lacking.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Utilizing resources from the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS), we examined the relationship between the previously published hepatic fat PRS (HFC-PRS) and HCC risk. We also constructed and evaluated a NAFLD-related PRS (NAFLD-PRS); the final version included SNPs in similar gene regions as the HFC-PRS but weighted by effect estimates for NAFLD among those with East Asian ancestry. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of HCC incidence with both HFC-PRS and NAFLD-PRS.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The HFC-PRS and NAFLD-PRS were highly correlated (Spearman r = 0.79, <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001). The highest quartiles of both the HFC-PRS and the NAFLD-PRS were associated with significantly increased risk of HCC with HR of 2.39 (95% CI 1.51, 3.78) and 1.77 (95% CI 1.15, 2.73), respectively, compared to their respective lowest quartile.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The HFC-PRS and the NAFLD-PRS may both be useful in stratifying Asian populations according to their risk of HCC. In addition, the association between the NAFLD-PRS, derived from East Asians, and HCC risk suggests a potential causal role for NAFLD in the development of HCC in this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3df9d6b0-0229-485c-ae53-9f358abd47bd\/@v03B8ZCM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic polymorphism,Epidemiology,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Liver,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13427"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Claire E.

Studies showed that high levels of several nutritional antioxidants (such as vitamin A, B2, E, and folate) are inversely associated with HR-HPV genital infection among women. These antioxidants are associated with dietary patterns, but associations between dietary patterns and genital HPV infection in women are understudied. To address this gap, this study aims to evaluate associations between healthy eating quality and patterns and genital HPV infection in women.<br \/>Method: The study included 10,543 women aged 18-59 years from the 14-year (2003-2016) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a US population-based survey. The outcome variable is the HPV infection status (HPV-negative, low-risk [LR] HPV, and HR-HPV), measured based on vaginal swabs. The dietary patterns were evaluated using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), which measures diet quality based on 13 food components based on key recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. A higher HEI score (overall score: range 0-100 or component score: 0-5 or 10) indicates a better diet quality. Associations between the HEI scores and HPV infections were evaluated using the survey weighting multinomial logistic regression adjusting for potential confounding factors.<br \/>Results: The mean HEI score for US women is 54.5 (standard error=0.4). Women with vaginal HPV infection tended to have a low HEI score (p&#60;0.001). The mean HEI scores for women with HPV-negative, LR-HPV, and HR-HPV are 55.6, 53.1, and 42.2, respectively. However, the association with the overall HEI score became non-statistically significant after adjusting the confounding factors (such as age, smoking, and sexual behavior). The women with the highest intake (score=5 out of 5) of greens and beans and total fruit had a lower risk of HR-HPV (OR=0.70 vs. score=0, p&#60;0.001, and OR=0.57, p&#60;0.01, respectively) adjusted for confounding factors. A high intake of whole grains and dairy can lower the risk of LR-HPV but not HR-HPV. In addition, women with a high score of total protein had a higher risk of HR-HPV (OR=2.1 for score=5 vs. 0-2, p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: This study showed that healthy eating patterns are inversely associated with vaginal HPV infection for US women. These findings can provide valuable insight into developing an intervention to prevent HPV infection from getting established or HPV persistence among the population at higher risk for cervical cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/20440ed0-8364-4ebe-b600-a4de74d51d51\/@v03B8ZCM\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-13 Infection and immune factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Diet,Cervical cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13488"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huiyi Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiufan Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tung-sung Tseng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krzysztof Reiss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin J.

Other than single cell migration, collective cell migration requires cell-cell connection with E-cadherin, however, E-cadherin is the epithelial marker in epithelial mesenchymal transition and acts as tumor suppressor function. Therefore, the role of E-cadherin in collective cell migration is still under investigated. In the collected cells, cell migration and cell division are coordinated for the cohort motility, the mechanism is still not clear. This study is to investigate the role of E-cadherin orientation in cell division dependent collective cell migration. Colorectal cancer cell line HT29 with epithelial morphology were used and treated with Cetuximab and Dasatinib to inhibit EGFR and Src activity. Cells were also incubated on fibronectin to monitor the matrix dependent environment. The polarity of E-cadherin distribution and cell contact inhibition were defined and detected by Immunofluorescence. The molecular expression of p-FAK, CDK4, and cell proliferation marker, Ki67 were revealed by Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and Western blot. The collective cell migration is analyzed and compared by wound healing and transwell assay. In the results, the polarized distribution of E-cadherin in leading cells which revealed pFAK expression on the cell membrane was associated with Ki67 and CDK4 positive proliferated cells. When cells were grown on fibronectin, the proliferated cells in the leading were decreased. When cells were treated with cetuximab, the E-cadherin distribution were not changed and had fewer effect on cell migration.

The obligate precursor to OPC is a persistent infection with an oncogenic HPV type that is unable to be cleared via natural immunity alone. However, the factors that influence HPV persistence at the oral cavity are unknown. It is plausible that long-term infection with other pathogens at the same anatomic site indicates an overall inability to clear an oral infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a saliva-transmitted gamma herpesvirus that infects 90% of the population by adulthood and replicates in the epithelial cells of the oropharynx. This study aimed to investigate whether oral EBV shedding, a marker of active viral replication, could serve as a biomarker for persistent, oncogenic oral HPV infection in men. Men with an HPV16 or 18 oral infection present at the baseline visit of the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) Study were included (n=63). Briefly, men from Tampa, FL, U.S.; Cuernavaca, Mexico; and Sao Paolo, Brazil were followed every 6 months for a median of 4.1 years. Men completed a risk factor questionnaire and provided an oral gargle sample at each visit. For this study, the baseline, 6-month, and 12-month oral specimens were HPV genotyped using the SPF10 PCR-DEIA-LiPA25 system. Presence of EBV was evaluated in the baseline specimen using PCR to amplify and quantify the EBV DNA on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument. Men with the same oral HPV type present at the 6-month and 12-month visit were categorized as 6-month and 12-month oral HPV persistent, respectively. The association between EBV and persistent HPV infection was investigated using a logistic regression model adjusted for age, country, and smoking. Among 63 men with oral HPV 16\/18 infection at baseline, 44 HPV infections did not persist, 19 persisted to at least 6-months and 11 persisted to at least 12 months. Among the total sample, 32 also had EBV detected in the oral gargle at baseline. Among men who did not have a persistent HPV infection, 21 (47.7%) had EBV detected at baseline while 11 (57.9%) men with an HPV infection that persisted at least 6 months had detectable EBV at baseline; and 9 (81.8%) of the men who persisted to 12 months had EBV detected. Mean EBV viral load was highest among men who persisted to at least 12 months (5.0 log copies\/ml) and was significantly higher than men who did not persist (2.5 log copies\/ml; p=0.047). Detection of oral EBV at baseline was significantly associated with elevated risk of &#8805;12-month oral HPV 16\/18 persistence (aOR: 9.90; 95% CI: 1.38-70.96), but not &#8805;6-month HPV 16\/18 persistence (aOR: 1.62; 95% CI: 0.52-5.06).These data support the hypothesis that EBV reactivation may be a biomarker of poor immune control leading to increased risk of oral HPV persistence. The use of a biomarker that identifies men whose HPV infection may persist would be a useful tool to allow for screening and early detection of OPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d495dc94-4314-4b47-a9b4-44de5b0290e2\/@w03B8ZCN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-13 Infection and immune factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),Human papillomavirus (HPV),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13489"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brittney L.

About 3 million US residents have been exposed to HCV and 65%-75% remain chronically infected. In response to increasing incidence of HCV infection in younger ages, the US Preventive Services Task Force and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) broadened HCV screening recommendations from baby boomers (born 1945-1965) to all adults aged 18-79 in 2020. Florida has the third highest number of individuals living with HCV in the U.S. (n=151,000). Therefore, our study aimed to identify current high-risk groups that may require advanced HCV screening and targeted HCV management using the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium, a state-wide health database representing a diverse set of more than one million individuals for the years 2015-2018. All HCV antibody and viral RNA tests ordered and completed during the study period were used to describe HCV seroprevalence (evidence of current\/past HCV infection) and HCV viral load (active infection). Logistic regression was used to determine the odds of HCV seroprevalence or active infection. Analyses were adjusted for sex, race\/ethnicity, birth cohort, and HIV status, then stratified by birth cohort and HIV status. Overall, HCV seroprevalence and active infection rates were highest among white\/non-Hispanics, males, and baby boomers. However, stratified results revealed distinct risk groups across year and race\/ethnicity. Odds of a positive HCV antibody test were higher among Black\/non-Hispanic individuals born before 1945 (aOR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.98-3.78) and 1945-1965 (aOR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.36-1.56) when compared to white\/non-Hispanics. However, in individuals born after 1966, Black\/non-Hispanics had lower odds of a positive HCV antibody test (1966-1985, aOR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.25-0.32; after 1985, aOR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.13-0.18), with white\/non-Hispanics having the highest HCV seroprevalence in younger birth cohorts. The same was observed for HCV active infection. When stratified by HIV status, odds of HCV seroprevalence were highest among baby boomers, regardless of HIV status. However, odds of an active HCV infection across birth cohorts differed by HIV status. Among people living with HIV, active infection was lower in people born after 1985 compared to baby boomers (aOR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24-0.86). In contrast, active infection was higher among individuals born after 1985 (aOR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.28-1.70) for HIV-uninfected individuals in Florida. Patterns of seroprevalence and active HCV infection identified in our study support the recent shift form age and risk based screening guidelines to universal screening. This study provides further guidance to support a strategy for early detection and treatment of HCV to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma among diverse populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5fad66c8-6d24-4387-895e-6aae11cff4e7\/@w03B8ZCN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-13 Infection and immune factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Cancer prevention,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13487"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brittney L.

High levels of these cytokines, which have a role in regulating inflammation, have been detected among individuals with severe COVID-19 disease. The objective of this study was to examine if pro-inflammatory SNPs in the promoter region of <i>IL-6, IL-1<\/i><i>&#946;<\/i>, and <i>IL-10<\/i> genes are associated with more severe COVID-19 disease and\/or increased anxiety\/stress levels in response to pandemic-associated stressors in a vulnerable Hispanic population that is part of the Puerto Rico Colorectal Cancer Registry.<br \/>Methods: TaqMan&#174; SNP Genotyping Assays (ThermoFisher Scientific) for <i>IL-1&#946;<\/i> (rs1143627), IL-6 (rs1800795), and IL-10 (rs1800871) were performed according to the manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations in individuals between the ages of 21 to 75 (n=136). We assessed their anxiety and stress levels using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Of these individuals, we evaluated those that had been previously infected with COVID-19 (n=38) for their symptom severity through a questionnaire. Chi-Square tests and Multivariate Logistic Regressions were used to calculate associations and ORs.<br \/>Results: Preliminary analysis showed an association between having the homozygous <i>IL-1&#946;<\/i> pro-inflammatory SNP and reporting fever as a symptom (OR=2.50, p-value=0.05). Individuals with the homozygous IL-10 pro-inflammatory SNP had higher odds of reporting difficulty breathing (OR= 4.51, p-value = 0.02), shortness of breath (OR=7.82, p-value=0.006), and fatigue as symptoms (OR=4.43, p-value=0.020. Further analysis also showed an association between having the homozygous IL-10 pro-inflammatory SNP and reporting at least 1 severe COVID-19 symptom (OR=3.38, p-value=0.046). Those with the homozygous or heterozygous IL-6 pro-inflammatory allele were less likely to report higher anxiety levels than those with the wild-type allele (OR=0.1447, p-value=0.04). We also observed that individuals between the ages of 21 to 49 were more likely to report changes in diet (OR=1.65, p-value=0.059) and constantly disinfecting as a pandemic-related stressor (OR=1.87, p-value=0.04) compared to individuals between the ages of 50 to 79.<br \/>Conclusions: Pro-inflammatory <i>IL-1<\/i><i>&#946;<\/i> and <i>IL-10<\/i> SNPs were associated with reporting fever and more severe symptoms of COVID-19, respectively. Data analysis using a larger sample size is warranted and is currently underway. Studies focused on examining that factors that contribute to more severe COVID-19 symptoms and how pandemic-associated stressors promote higher inflammation levels as a result of increased stress\/anxiety are needed to fully understand the long-term effects the pandemic on public health, including possible increases in cancer incidence due to chronic inflammation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dcac9acb-3197-405a-926d-fc832018165f\/@w03B8ZCN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-13 Infection and immune factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Interleukin-1,Interleukin-10,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13486"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Gonzalez-Pons<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valeria Valentin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ingrid Montes-Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria J.

However, few epidemiologic studies have comprehensively examined associations between BAs and either liver endpoints or biliary cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study, we designed 1:1 matched nested case-control studies of primary liver cancer (n=247 cases), fatal liver disease (n=261 cases), and primary biliary cancer (n=92 cases). Using baseline serum collected &#8804;30 years prior to diagnosis or death, we measured concentrations of 15 BAs with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between BAs and each endpoint, accounting for multiple comparisons.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Comparing the highest to the lowest quartile, ten BAs were positively associated with liver cancer risk, including taurocholic (OR<sub> <\/sub>=4.70, 95% CI=2.51-8.78; Q-trend&#60;0.0001), taurochenodeoxycholic (OR<sub> <\/sub>=4.61, 95% CI=2.38-8.91; Q-trend&#60;0.0001), and glycocholic acid OR<sub> <\/sub>=4.11, 95% CI=2.11-7.99; Q-trend&#60;0.0001), and 11 were positively associated with fatal liver disease risk, including taurochenodeoxycholic acid (OR<sub> <\/sub>=9.65, 95% CI=4.41-21.14; Q-trend&#60;0.0001), taurocholic OR<sub> <\/sub>=7.45, 95% CI=3.70-14.97; Q-trend&#60;0.0001), taurochenodeoxycholic (OR<sub> <\/sub>=9.05, 95% CI=4.04-20.32; Q-trend&#60;0.0001), and glycocholic acid OR=6.12, 95% CI=2.84-13.77; Q-trend&#60;0.0001). No significant associations were observed between BAs and biliary cancer though ORs were consistently &#62;1.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Conjugated BAs were strongly associated with increased risk of liver cancer and fatal liver disease, suggesting mechanistic links between the gut microbiota, BA signaling pathways, and liver cancer or death from liver disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6f72fcd2-c3e9-4762-be93-e43b3f56340f\/@w03B8ZCN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Bile acid,Metabolomics,Cholangiocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21439"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zeinab Farhat<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neal D.
