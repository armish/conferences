[{"Abstract":"Background: Anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has largely failed as a monotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer likely due to inadequate tumor neoantigen load and inadequate T cell filtration (TILs). Strategies to increase TILs that can be tested in novel syngeneic mouse models are needed in order to fulfill this critical medical need. CDK7 is a major regulator of the cell cycle that is under investigation as a novel therapeutic target. CDK7 inhibition can trigger robust anti-tumor immunity by causing genomic instability and DNA damage in lung cancer mouse models. Herein, we characterize our novel syngeneic mouse models and report on the anti-tumor activity of CDK7 alone and in combination with anti-PD1 ICB as an immunotherapeutic strategy.<br \/>Methods: We generated two models of prostate cancer organoids and syngeneic mouse models. <i>APC<\/i> and <i>PTEN<\/i> are tumor suppressor genes commonly lost in metastatic prostate cancer and are emerging as a putative mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy. The MPA and MPP models were established by ex-vivo Lenti-Cas9-sgRNA knock-out of <i>APC<\/i> or <i>PTEN<\/i> from the prostate organoids grown in 3D cultures established from the prostate of a <i>MYC<\/i><sup>T<\/sup>\/<i>TP53<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> GEMM.<br \/>Results: Organoids from the MPA and MPP models form orthotopic high grade prostate adenocarcinoma from 2 to 3 weeks post-implantation and spontaneously develop lung metastases 10-12 weeks after orthotopic implantation. In addition, the MPA model developed immediate castration resistance and neuroendocrine transformation following hormone deprivation <i>in vivo<\/i>. By contrast, the MPP tumors significantly regressed after in vivo androgen deprivation. Baseline immunoprofiling of the MPA and MPP orthotopic tumors showed increased infiltration from monocytic MDSCs and expression of T cell exhaustion markers. Treatment of the MPA and MPP orthotopic models with YKL-5-124, a CDK7 inhibitor, led to substantial <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth inhibition, which was further augmented by the addition of anti-PD-1 ICB. Immunoprofiling of tumors treated with combined YKL-5-124 and PD-1 blockade showed activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and a decrease in the Treg, B cell and NK cell population.<br \/>Conclusions: The MPA and MPP orthotopic models recapitulate the biology and immune suppressive microenvironment of advanced prostate cancer and provide useful tools for immunotherapy drug development. Combination of CDK7 inhibition with anti-PD-1 blockade profoundly inhibited <i>in vivo<\/i> orthotopic tumor growth in both MPA and MPP model, providing a rationale for exploring CDK7 in combination with PD-1 checkpoint immunotherapy as a novel therapeutical strategy for advanced prostate cancer.<br \/>Funding Acknowledgements: DRW is funded through 2018YI2295 Prostate Cancer Foundation Young Investigator Award and PC160944 Department of Defense Physician Research Career Development Award.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/940ae5bd-c1b4-4397-b564-2146138a8be9\/@A03B8ZKo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,CDK7,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13251"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>David R.

While the pathophysiology of MM is poorly understood, the substantial responsiveness of MM patients to proteasomal inhibitors (PIs) like bortezomib or carfilzomib hints towards a central role of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Deubiquitylases (DUBs) are therapeutically targetable components of the UPS, whose inhibition can destabilize oncoproteins. However, the identities of oncoprotein-regulating DUBs remain largely elusive. To identify new vulnerabilities in MM, a CRISPR\/Cas9 screen targeting all human DUBs was performed. For validated candidates, phenotypical analysis regarding proliferation and cell cycle progression was performed, as well affinity and non-affinity mass spectrometry-based screens to identify substrates. We thereby identified OTUD6B as a novel oncogene that drives G1\/S-transition. LIN28B, a suppressor of microRNA biogenesis, was delineated as both a cell cycle-specific deubiquitylation substrate and activator of OTUD6B. RNA-Seq and qPCR analyses of OTUD6B and LIN28B depleted MM cells revealed that the stabilization of LIN28B drives MYC expression and activity at the G1\/S transition, which in turn allows for rapid S-phase entry. Thus, silencing of OTUD6B as well as LIN28B inhibited MM outgrowth in xenograft experiments. Analyses of large MM patient cohorts revealed a progressive increase of OTUD6B expression along the transition from normal plasma cells to MGUS to MM and that high expression of OTUD6B was associated with a significantly adverse overall survival. Furthermore, OTUD6B expression was found to strongly correlate with MYC expression and significantly reduced progression-free survival in patients treated with the PI bortezomib. Knockout of OTUD6B in MM cells significantly enhance the anti-myeloma activity of the drug when using sub-lethal doses. Together, these results validate OTUD6B as a new therapeutically targetable oncogene, dependency, and prognostic factor in MM, that eventually serves as a master regulator of MYC activity to drive cell cycle progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b52d4cf0-1798-43f8-afe3-39ddb7550194\/@A03B8ZKo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Control of cell cycle progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,Cell cycle arrest,Multiple myeloma,Myc,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13238"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ria Spallek<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Paulmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oleksandra Karpiuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jana Zecha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Klaeger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabell Schaeffer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rupert Öllinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Engleitner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Krönke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Wirth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ullrich Keller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roland Rad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernahrd Kuster<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Bassermann<\/i><\/presenter>.

Majority of Ewing sarcoma patients (~85%) carry an <i>EWSR1-FLI1<\/i> fusion gene derived from t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation. The formation of <i>EWSR1-FLI1<\/i> leads to the loss of one wild type <i>EWSR1<\/i> allele, however, how loss of the gene contributes to the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma remains unclear. Our previous study revealed that the EWSR1 is required for a faithful mitosis. We demonstrated that the mutant <i>ewsa<\/i> (a homologue of human <i>EWSR1<\/i>) zebrafish induces mitotic defects, aneuploidy, and promotes tumorigenesis (with <i>tp53 <\/i>mutation). Consistently, Ewing sarcoma patients display high incidence of aneuploidy (e.g. approximately 47% of the patients display trisomy 8). For these reasons, we aim to elucidate the molecular function of <i>EWSR1<\/i> in faithful chromosome segregation and in maintenance of chromosome stability. To accomplish our goal, we employed the Auxin-Inducible Degron (AID) system because it allows us to conditionally degrade EWSR1 proteins in a cell line. Both <i>EWSR1<\/i> alleles were tagged with mini-AID using CRISPR\/Cas9 system in a stable DLD-1 cell that expresses a plant E3 ligase TIR1. The western blot verified the efficient degradation of EWSR1 when the cells were treated with Auxin (AUX+) for 24hrs. To determine whether EWSR1 maintains chromosomal stability, the cells were synchronized to pro-metaphase using thymidine\/nocodazole protocol, and were treated with AUX for 24hrs (underwent one cell cycle) concurrently. The EWSR1 knockdown (AUX+) cells displayed significantly higher incidence of lagging chromosomes compared to the control (AUX-) cells. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry using the antibody against the key mitotic regulator, Aurora B, revealed that the EWSR1 knockdown (AUX+) cells displayed significantly less incidence of Aurora B localization at inner centromere, but higher incidence of localization on kinetochore compared to the control (AUX-) cells. Consistently, when the cells that were treated with AUX for 48hrs (underwent two cell cycles), it displayed significantly higher incidence of aberrant numbers of chromosome compared to the control (AUX-) cells. In general, impaired chromosome segregation leads to mitotic delay, accompanied by the activation of mitotic checkpoint. However, the EWSR1 knockdown (AUX+) cells did not undergo any arrest in mitosis. Therefore, our data suggest that the EWSR1 knockdown (AUX+) cells not only induces aneuploidy by inducing lagging chromosome, but also it may override mitotic checkpoint. Currently, we are in a process of elucidating the molecular mechanism of EWSR1 knockdown dependent mitigation of mitotic arrest. Successful completion of the study may shed light on how\/whether haploinsufficiency of EWSR1 contributes to the molecular pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f5d8248a-840f-4464-bc17-516abc92d2c7\/@A03B8ZKo\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 Cell cycle checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitosis,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Bone,Checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13245"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haeyoung Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mizuki Azuma<\/i><\/presenter>.

CDK4\/6 inhibitors have transformed the treatment paradigm of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2- breast cancer with three CDK4\/6 inhibitors currently FDA approved.<br \/>Brain metastasis commonly arises in patients with breast, lung, melanoma and other cancer types, is associated with poor survival outcomes and poses distinct challenges in clinical management. Due to advances in imaging technologies, the detection of brain metastases is increasing and there is a dearth of novel therapies to combat brain metastatic cancers and impact patient survival.<br \/>Here, we describe a novel brain penetrant CDK4\/6 inhibitor, PRT3645 exhibiting single digit nanomolar biochemical potency against CDK 4\/6 and &#62;2000-fold selectivity against other CDK family members (CDK1, CDK2, and CDK9). In cellular assays, PRT3645 inhibits cellular phosphorylation of RB with low nanomolar activity. Consistent with this, PRT3645 treatment resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines and in HER2- and HER2+ breast cancer lines (EC50 values &#60; 125 nM). Furthermore, PRT3645 demonstrated additive <i>in vitro<\/i> activity with fulvestrant or tucatinib in ER+ and HER2+ breast cancer lines.<br \/>PRT3645 exhibits favorable in vitro safety pharmacology and ADME profiles, including brain exposure in rodents at steady state, and demonstrates oral bioavailability across rodents, dog and nonhuman primates. <i>In vivo<\/i>, oral PRT3645 was well tolerated and highly efficacious in a dose-dependent manner in subcutaneous xenograft models of GBM and breast cancer and in orthotopic human breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) and GBM models in mice as a monotherapy. PRT3645 showed tumor regression as single agent in the MCF7 ER+ breast cancer model and a combinatorial benefit with the estrogen receptor blocker, fulvestrant. In a HER2+ BT474-luc orthotopic model, similarly efficacious single agent activity of PRT3645 was achieved, as well as a significant combinatorial benefit on tumor growth and median survival when administered with the brain penetrant HER2 kinase inhibitor, tucatinib. PRT3645 was highly efficacious in a U87-luc GBM orthotopic model and demonstrated enhanced median survival benefit when combined with an orally active brain penetrant PRMT5 inhibitor.<br \/>In summary, PRT3645 demonstrates an excellent balance of potency, selectivity, PK parameters across species, brain penetrance and favorable tissue distribution relative to brain exposure, and currently has advanced into IND-enabling preclinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/35be5203-eb9e-4ea1-a10e-3f8a16405130\/@A03B8ZKo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK inhibitor,Cell cycle inhibitors,Breast cancer,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13255"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ashish Juvekar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Buesking<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dave Rominger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Rager<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Ruepp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirsten Gallagher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yue Zou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miles Cowart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaowei Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Pawley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Holmes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Gowen-MacDonald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kris Vaddi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Combs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce Ruggeri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peggy Scherle<\/i><\/presenter>.

The cell cycle is comprised of 4 phases that are tightly regulated by two key transcriptional modulators, RB-E2F and MUVB complexes that regulate gene expression during the G1\/S and G2\/M cell cycle transitions, respectively. Target transcriptomes of both complexes overlap, suggesting that maximal inhibition of cell cycle progression, requires targeting both. Inhibitors that regulate the RB-E2F signaling axis have been FDA approved for treatment of a subset of breast cancers. These drugs specifically inhibit two kinases involved in the cell cycle known as CDK4 and CDK6. Palbociclib and abemaciclib, CDK4\/CDK6 inhibitors (CDK4\/6i), decrease cell proliferation by inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest. In contrast to CDK4\/6, we previously reported that the activity of MUVB complex can be repressed using inhibitors of BET proteins, including the tool compound, JQ1. We hypothesized that dual targeting of MUVB and CDK4\/CDK6 will synergize in breast cancer models to further decrease growth. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the impact of growth by adding JQ-1 to CDK4\/6i in multiple intrinsically resistant cell lines. We found that addition of JQ-1 reduced IC<sub>50<\/sub> of CDK4\/6i by 60-75% and that the combination displayed synergistic growth suppression. Mechanistically, analysis of mRNA and protein expression revealed that the combination had greater ability to suppress expression of proteins that are MUVB target genes, G2\/M, compared to single agents. We found through genetic and pharmacological approaches that inhibition of G2\/M proteins Aurora Kinase A and NEK2 mediated CDK4\/6i inhibitor response. Preclinical xenograft models confirmed that combined inhibition of CDK4\/6 and MUVB, NEK2, or Aurora Kinase A can synergistically suppress tumor growth. Together, these results indicate that dual targeting of distinct phases of the cell cycle should be a more efficacious approach for suppressing breast cancer growth and provide a potential approach for blocking the acquisition of resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibitors, a major clinical challenge for the treatment of luminal breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e6e3218a-d56a-46ea-aaa8-10377e0d94f1\/@A03B8ZKo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,NEK2,Combination studies,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13247"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Leslie Cuellar-Vite<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Weber-Bonk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruth A.

The route to immortality found in over 50 cancer types is mutation of the <i>TERT <\/i>promoter (<i>TERT<\/i>p) mutations. Studies in glioblastoma have shown the two most common <i>TERT<\/i>p mutations, G228A and G250A, reactivate <i>TERT<\/i> expression through <i>de novo<\/i> E26 transformation specific (ETS) site generation that, in tandem with a native <i>TERT<\/i>p ETS site, recruits the tetrameric GA-binding protein (GABP) complex formed by two GABP alpha (GABPA) subunits and two tetramer specific GABPB1 (B1) subunits, GABPB1L (B1L). While ten additional <i>TERT<\/i>p mutations have been described across cancer types, functional studies have been limited to select mutations and cancer types. We found that each <i>de novo<\/i> ETS motif generating <i>TERT<\/i>p mutation increases <i>TERT<\/i>p transcriptional activity in a GABP-dependent manner. Furthermore, our pan-cancer analysis demonstrated selective enrichment of GABPA at the mutant <i>TERT<\/i>p across 14 cancer types and further determined that this recruitment is necessary for <i>TERT <\/i>expression. Prior investigations found that CRISPR-cas9 mediated mutagenesis of the B1 ninth exon, specific to B1L, reduces <i>TERT<\/i> transcriptional activity in a <i>TERT<\/i>p-mutation dependent manner. We explored B1L targeting in the reversal of tumor cell immortality<i> <\/i>in several cancers. We found that the B1 dimer restricted isoform, GABPB1S (B1S), is consistently and significantly increased following B1L reduction, which we determined to be the consequence of a disengagement of a GABP tetramer mediated negative feedback loop acting on the B1<i> <\/i>promoter. Interestingly, this upregulated B1S expression enables GABP dimer binding and activation of the mutant <i>TERT<\/i>p thereby compensating for B1L loss. Indeed, knockout of B1L and B1S together resulted in a near complete elimination of GABPA <i>TERT<\/i>p recruitment and a striking reduction in <i>TERT<\/i> expression, leading to telomere shortening and ultimately resulting in tumor cell death and senescence. This data identifies GABP as the master regulator of the mutant <i>TERT<\/i>p across cancer type and <i>de novo<\/i> ETS mutation type and suggests a new model of the GABP-TERT axis involving both the GABP tetramer, and the GABP dimer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e4c12ca9-3400-4342-8e45-bc107bb8b647\/@A03B8ZKo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Telomeres and telomerase,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TERT,Gene regulation,Transcription factor,Expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13246"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicholas O.

Inhibition of WEE1, in conjunction with genetic alterations and\/or addition of a DNA damaging agent, results in mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis of cancer cells, offering an attractive approach to treating cancer. Debio 0123 is a WEE1 specific inhibitor previously shown to sensitize cancer cells to DNA damaging agents which is currently being assessed in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with poor clinical outcomes that carries a high mutational burden and genomic instability. Here we investigated the ability of Debio 0123 to enhance SCLC response to standard of care (SOC) DNA damaging agents carboplatin and etoposide in vitro and in vivo.<br \/>Methods: SCLC cell lines were treated with Debio 0123 alone or in combination with etoposide or carboplatin in vitro and apoptosis assessed by flow cytometry. In vivo SCLC patient derived- or cell line derived-xenograft (PDX or CDX, respectively) models were treated with Debio 0123 orally in combination with either carboplatin or etoposide alone or as a triple combination. Tumor growth inhibition was assessed over 3 cycles of treatment and tolerability of the combinations evaluated by monitoring body weight changes.<br \/>Results: Debio 0123 synergized with carboplatin and etoposide in vitro leading to a significant increase in the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, Debio 0123 significantly improved the tumor growth inhibitory effect of etoposide and carboplatin in both PDX and CDX models of SCLC in vivo. Triple combination of carboplatin, etoposide and Debio 0123 was well tolerated at therapeutically relevant dosing and resulted in significantly improved tumor response when compared to carboplatin and etoposide treatments alone or to the double combination.<br \/>Conclusions: Taken together these results highlight that inhibiting WEE1 with Debio 0123 significantly improves tumor response to SOC DNA damaging agents in models of SCLC, providing the foundation for future clinical exploration of Debio 0123 in SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/39e3a850-0d2a-4f2f-a086-44c3fe036d64\/@A03B8ZKo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 Cell cycle checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"WEE1,Cancer therapy,Combination studies,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13241"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luke Piggott<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Vaslin-Chessex<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noemie Luong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Tschumi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregoire Vuagniaux<\/i><\/presenter>.

Deregulation of different CDKs is frequently observed in human cancer. Enzymatic kinase activity of CDKs is dependent on the binding of a member of the Cyclin protein family. So far more than 15 Cyclins have been described most of them can bind and activate different CDKs. Current data suggest the physiological relevance of at least 50 different CDK\/Cyclin complexes. Since the 20 CDKs share significant structural homology and regulate different function in cell growth and development, selectivity of compounds within the CDK family is of critical importance.<br \/>Approval of a first CDK inhibitor (Palbociclib) targeting CDK4\/6 for the treatment of ER+\/HER+- breast cancer served as a clinical proof that targeting specific members of the CDK protein kinase family is a versatile approach to treat cancer. The approval of the first CDK inhibitor sparked the research and development of other inhibitors targeting different members of the CDK-family. Currently, four additional CDK4\/6 inhibitors have been approved and more than 15 CDK inhibitors with limited selectivity are in different preclinical or clinical development phases. However, the critical importance of selectivity within the CDK family is underlined by the fact that the clinical development of four CDK9 inhibitors has been stopped due to the lack of selectivity and high toxicity. Different approaches (including inhibition by covalent binding) have resulted in more selective inhibitors, especially against CDKs like CDK7, CDK9 and CDK12. Although several biochemical activity assays for different CDKs have been set up and used for selectivity testing, so far no panel covering all 20 human CDKs using one assay technology has been described.<br \/>We report here the setup of a biochemical in-vitro activity assay panel of 32 CDK\/Cyclins complexes generated recombinantly in insect cells covering the complete set of all 20 human CDKs. For all 32 complexes a radiometric biochemical activity assay has successfully been established allowing to characterize inhibitors with respect to their biochemical selectivity applying the same assay technology. Using the comprehensive CDK panel we determined the IC50 values of more than 15 CDK inhibitors that have been either approved or are in different preclinical and clinical development phases. Results will be presented showing the selectivity of these inhibitors not only for all 20 CDKs but also for specific CDKs forming active complexes with two or more different cyclins. This CDK screening panel allows the generation of comparative data on compound selectivity early in development, thereby helping to reduce the risk of designing compounds with suboptimal target selectivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/46442a66-f645-4e2f-bf48-a33c0f27b1d7\/@A03B8ZKo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK,Drug discovery,Assay development,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13256"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Müller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Totzke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Weber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Gericke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diane Krämer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolin Heidemann-Dinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Constance Ketterer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael H.

It develops from rhabdomyoblasts and can arise in a variety of anatomic locations. Recent findings have assisted the prediction of disease prognosis and treatment regimens based on genetic and cellular differences among the major types of RMS. One potential target is a cellular appendage called the primary cilium.<br \/>Primary cilia are thought to play a critical role in the regulation of myogenesis, a process deregulated in RMS. During myogenesis, Gli protein accumulates at the primary cilia in myoblasts and induces proliferation. The centrosome protein, centriolin (CNTRL), is known to be a key structural component of primary cilia. Therefore, we hypothesized that disruption of CNTRL, using CRISPR\/Cas9, may affect Gli protein function and, therefore, the proliferation of these cells.<br \/>Two cell lines were used: A204, a rhabdoid cell line, and CCL-136, an embryonal RMS cell line. When CNTRL was depleted and analyzed 2 days post-transfection, a significant reduction in cell viability was observed in CCL-136 compared to control, whereas no significant increase in cell death in A204 was observed. Gli1 expression decreased in both cells lines when CNTRL was eliminated, while cell cycle progression was also reduced, as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of Ki67. Unexpectedly, primary cilia formation, indicated by Arl13B expression, increased in A204 with CNTRL loss, with no perceptible change in CCL-136 cells.<br \/>To assess differentiation potential, A204 and CCL-136 were cultured in differentiation media using 2% horse serum. Separately, cells were cultured in 0% FBS (serum) to test differentiation potential under starvation conditions. As expected, both cell lines expressed robust levels of MyoG, a muscle differentiation marker, with 2% horse serum. However, loss of CNTRL leads to a perceptible decrease in MyoG in the CCL-136, and a slight decrease in A204. Additionally, wound healing assays were conducted and showed CCL-136 had inherently greater ability to migrate 24 hours post-wound compared to A204., However, CCL-136 showed diminished migration under stressed conditions. Interestingly, cell migration was significantly diminished in A204 under starvation conditions when CNTRL was depleted (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>We show that CNTRL loss inhibits the cell cycle in two different forms of RMS. This arrest occurs with a corresponding reduction in Gli1 expression. This confirms previous studies that suggest Gli1 is a critical factor in maintaining the proliferative state. In addition, our results show that in cells normally producing primary cilia, like A204, CNTRL loss increases the number of ciliated cells. Taken together, our data support the possibility of inhibiting cellular proliferation of RMS cells through manipulation of CNTRL and suggest that CNTRL may be a viable future treatment target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9c635fbd-6f07-48ce-9fa3-f551a22d8354\/@A03B8ZKo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Control of cell cycle progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Centriolin,Primary cilia,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13244"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yoshinori Takeda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ariel Cole<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caitlin Boyle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Gromley<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cell cycle dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer and targeting its genetic drivers can confer therapeutic benefits. Cyclin E1 (<i>CCNE1<\/i>) gene alterations are common in patients with ovarian cancer and can be found in ~20% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer cases, which tend to be platinum therapy resistant and therefore represent a high medical need. Cyclin E1 is the canonical binding partner of CDK2, which becomes constitutively active when <i>CCNE1<\/i> is amplified and overexpressed. Selectively inhibiting CDK2 is an attractive therapeutic option for <i>CCNE1<\/i>-amplified tumors and may limit off-target CDK-driven toxicities. Here we report preclinical validation studies leading to the development of an orally available CDK2 inhibitor, BLU-222, for the treatment of ovarian cancer harboring a <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>BLU-222 selectivity was measured by enzyme assays, cellular target engagement assays (NanoBRET), and proliferation assays in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. <i>In vitro <\/i>cellular potency was assessed by phospho-Rb levels. <i>In vivo<\/i> antitumor activity of BLU-222 as a single agent or in combination with carboplatin was measured in an OVCAR-3 cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) tumor model harboring a <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>BLU-222 demonstrated selectivity, both biochemically and in cells, with low nanomolar potency for CDK2 vs other CDK family members (CDK1, -4, -6, -7, and -9).

However, development of resistance highlights the need for treatment strategies to improve outcomes. To study resistance mechanisms, breast cancer cell lines were treated with CDK4\/6i (abemaciclib or palbociclib) in combination with 4-OH-tamoxifen (tamoxifen) for 120-144h and sorted for resistant cells defined as geminin positive (GEM+), a marker of S\/G2\/M cell cycle accumulation. To confirm the resistant phenotype, cell lines were treated with tamoxifen plus the CDK4\/6 inhibitor used to drive resistance. To understand if sequential CDK4\/6i treatment is effective in controlling cell proliferation, resistant cells generated through treatment with palbociclib + tamoxifen or abemaciclib + tamoxifen were treated with abemaciclib + ET (fulvestrant or tamoxifen) or palbociclib + ET, respectively. Geminin\/Ki67, annexin V and colony formation assays were performed to evaluate cell proliferation and viability. Molecular characterization by western blot and RNAseq analysis were utilized to provide insights into mechanisms of resistance and the effects of sequential treatment with CDK4\/6i + ET. Cell lines resistant to palbociclib + tamoxifen subsequently treated with abemaciclib + ET showed decreased %GEM+ and colony formation ability, decreased Ki67 levels, and increased apoptosis. These effects were not observed in cell lines resistant to abemaciclib + tamoxifen following subsequent treatment with palbociclib + ET. Western blot analysis showed that palbociclib and abemaciclib-resistant cells had increased CDK6 and pERK levels, compared to control. Importantly, treatment of palbociclib-resistant cells with abemaciclib + ET decreased FOXM1, a key regulator of senescence and apoptosis. Cyclin A, a marker of mitosis, was also decreased, consistent with decreased %GEM+ subpopulation in palbociclib + ET resistant cells. These effects were not observed in abemaciclib-resistant cells treated with palbociclib + ET.In summary, our <i>in vitro<\/i> data provides mechanistic insights into resistance to combination CDK4\/6i + tamoxifen and suggests the potential benefit of sequential treatment with abemaciclib + ET to overcome resistance in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a1f8e6d-cec6-4e27-8c98-5694e3c36336\/@B03B8ZKp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Resistance,Sequential Treatment,Tamoxifen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13253"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elisabet Zapatero-Solana<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria P.

Lipid metabolism provides an important energy source for cancer cells; cells increase lipid supply by endogenous synthesis or exogenous uptake. Both processes can become dysregulated in cancer, but little is known about the role of either pathway in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The goal of this project was to determine whether inhibition of lipid synthesis with concurrent lipid deprivation affects NET cell proliferation and survival.<br \/><b>Methods.<\/b> (i) Expression and localization of fatty acid synthase (FASN) in NET patient samples (n=39) and human cell lines (BON, QGP-1, and NT-3) were examined with immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, respectively. (ii) NET neutral lipid stores were determined with immunofluorescent analysis of Bodipy 493\/503 staining. (iii) To study the role of lipid synthesis and lipid uptake on colony formation, NET cells were treated with TVB-3664 with or without FA depletion for 10d. Colonies were visualized with sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye staining and quantified with photospectrometry. (iv) To study the effect of lipid synthesis and uptake on proliferation, NET cells were treated with TVB-3664 with or without FA depletion for 72h, 96h, and 120h. Cellular growth was determined with SRB assays. (v) The effect of TVB-3664 on cyclin D1 and &#946;-catenin expression in NET cells was determined with immunoblotting.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> (i) FASN was detected in the cytoplasm of all 39 NET primary and metastatic tissue samples; scores of 5 or 6 indicated robust expression in 38\/39 samples. Among cell lines, FASN expression was highest in BON cells followed by similar levels in QGP-1 and NT-3 cells. (ii) TVB-3664 treatment or lipid deprivation for 5d reduced neutral lipid storage in BON cells; combined TVB-3664 treatment with FA depletion for 5d fully depleted BON lipid stores. (iii) TVB-3664 treatment, but not FA deprivation, reduced NET colony formation by ~25% in BON cells and ~50% in QGP-1 cells. TVB-3664 treatment with FA deprivation reduced colony formation by ~65% in BON cells and ~75% in QGP-1 cells. (iv) TVB-3664 treatment or FA deprivation reduced NET cell proliferation at 72h, 96h, and 120h. (v) TVB-3664 treatment reduced cyclin D1 expression in BON and QGP-1 cells and &#946;-catenin levels in BON cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions.<\/b> Our findings indicate that FASN is robustly expressed in NET patient samples and cell lines. Inhibition of endogenous lipid synthesis with concurrent lipid deprivation reduces colony formation and proliferation of NET cells. Importantly, our findings show that lipid metabolism promotes NET cell growth and that targeting <i>de novo<\/i> lipogenesis may be a potential treatment strategy for advanced GEP-NETs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a0cde1e-49a8-4c6c-8baa-d6a8a26dcc16\/@B03B8ZKp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 Cell cycle checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipid metabolism,Neuroendocrine tumors,Fatty acid synthase,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13257"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeremy Johnson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yekaterina Y.

The annual incidence of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is approximately 11,000 cases in the United States and STS is among the top five causes of cancer deaths for those under 20 years old. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a serine\/threonine protein kinase involved in transcription elongation through phosphorylation and activation of RNA polymerase II (RPB1), which increases the levels of key oncogenic genes like myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and c-Myc. CDK9 inhibition reduces their expression, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. TP-1287 is an orally delivered phosphate pro-drug of alvocidib, a potent CDK9 inhibitor. We hypothesized that alvocidib, the pharmaceutically active form of TP-1287, can inhibit the CDK9 signaling pathway and suppress tumor growth of sarcoma cells. Alvocidib demonstrated the suppression of the phosphorylation of RPB1 (p-RPB1) and MCL-1 expression in an A-673 Ewing sarcoma cell line and U-2 OS and MG-63 osteosarcoma cell lines after 6-hr treatment. In U-2 OS cells, 24-hr treatment with alvocidib induced the cleavage of PARP-1, an indicator of apoptosis, whereas less than 6-hr treatment with alvocidib failed to induce PARP-1 cleavage, suggesting that long-term CDK9 suppression would be necessary for the apoptosis induction in sarcoma cells. In cell viability assays using CellTiter-Glo, alvocidib demonstrated an IC50 of around 100 nM: 32 - 90 nM in sarcoma cell lines after 4-day treatment and 24 - 174 nM in sarcoma cells, which were obtained from patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, after 6-day treatment. In the sarcoma cells from PDX models, MCL-1 mRNA expression was moderately correlated with alvocidib sensitivity. Further bioinformatic analysis to predict alvocidib sensitivity is currently underway. In immunofluorescence analysis, alvocidib induced the activation of caspase-3\/7, another indicator of apoptosis, after 2-day treatment in the sarcoma cells from PDX models. In an in vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) study using BALB\/c mice, p-RPB1 and MCL-1 suppression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was observed after single administration of TP-1287. In an in vivo efficacy study using the A-673 model, TP-1287 showed a trend of tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at 2.5 mg\/kg (QD), but not at 7.5 mg\/kg (Q3D). These in vivo studies suggest that CDK9 signaling pathway was inhibited after TP-1287 administration in vivo and that continuous CDK9 inhibition would be needed for TGI in sarcoma models. In vivo efficacy and PD studies using sarcoma PDX models are currently ongoing. Taken together, alvocidib has shown activity in inhibiting the growth of sarcoma cells and TP-1287 could be a viable therapeutic option targeting the CDK9 pathway in sarcomas. TP-1287 is being investigated for solid tumors including sarcomas (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03604783).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ede3cdfd-c007-4163-b609-0db58f3f97a4\/@B03B8ZKp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK inhibitor,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Mcl-1,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13252"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuta Matsumura<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroki Umehara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Oishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Siddiqui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason M.

EZH2 is frequently mutated or overexpressed in many types of cancer. Extensive research in the past has revealed that EZH2 forms part of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), an essential multi-protein complex required for gene silencing and chromatin compaction. EZH2 also displays additional cellular functions that include transcriptional activation of certain gene expression and methylation of non-histone substrates, the latter modulating protein stability or actin polymerization. Moreover, EZH2 is known to play a role in regulating cell cycle progression. However, it remains unclear whether EZH2 has an enzyme-independent function in the cell cycle. Here we show that EZH2 knockdown by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) results in an increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors including p21, p27, and p57, which is associated with G<sub>1<\/sub>\/S arrest. We have also observed that HeLa cells treated with Tazemestostat, a specific EZH2 inhibitor, display a significant reduction in H3K27me3. However, Tazemestostat treatment neither increases expression of p21, p27, and p57 nor induces cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which EZH2 regulates cell cycle progression through its enzyme-independent function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95eb1d5f-2ac0-4346-a76a-2ce62e2d403e\/@B03B8ZKp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Control of cell cycle progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EZH2,Cell cycle,PRC2,Polycomb group,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13242"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tania Marlyn Colon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byeong Hyeok Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Dai<\/i><\/presenter>.

Targeted Osmotic Lysis (TOL) is a novel cancer therapy that combines pharmacologically blocking Na<sup>+<\/sup>,K<sup>+<\/sup>, ATPase (sodium pumps) while stimulating VGSCs with a pulsed electric field. The consequent increase in intracellular Na+ causes an osmotic lysis of the cells that overexpress VGSCs. Noncancerous cells, with fewer VGSCs do not lyse. We hypothesized that variability in efficacy of TOL is due to VGSC expression that varies across the cell cycle. We assessed cell surface expression of VGSCs and Na<sup>+<\/sup>,K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPase during phases of the cell cycle in which there are single copies of DNA compared with phases in which DNA has doubled. For this, DNA was labeled with either propidium iodide or DAPI and VGSCs were labeled with a pan-specific VGSC antibody while Na<sup>+<\/sup>,K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPases were labelled with a pan-specific Na<sup>+<\/sup>,K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPase antibody in eight immortalized cancer and non-cancer cell lines. With flow cytometry we showed that VGSC expression doubled during phases of cell division (S-M phases) while Na<sup>+<\/sup>,K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPase expression increased by 1.5-fold. To further elucidate the role of VGSCs and Na<sup>+<\/sup>,K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPases throughout the cell cycle, S-Trityl-L-cysteine (STLC) was used to suspend the cell cycle in M phase. We hypothesized that treating cancer cells with TOL in the S-M phases would lead to increased cell death, compared to cells that were not suspended in M phase by STLC (G0-G1 phases). Cells were either treated with STLC or media without drug for 24 hours, then exposed to TOL treatment. The efficacy of the treatment was measured using a MTT assay revealing that cell death was greater in STLC-treated cells than control cells. By using cell cycle inhibitors, we may increase the efficacy of TOL for treating advanced carcinomas that overexpress VGSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4a5c0043-9f89-48f9-b670-0e410dd0b5d7\/@B03B8ZKp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Control of cell cycle progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle,Cell cycle regulation,Cell cycle arrest,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13250"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samantha Edenfield<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harry J.

Therefore, there have been various attempts to cure the cancer by developing new efficient anti-cancer therapy in addition to surgical resection and chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated the effects of fenbendazole, an anti-helminthic drug, both colon cancer cells and patient-derived colon tumor organoids. Notably, we employed 3D tumor organoid models because 2D-cultured cell lines were not able to recapitulate the physiology of solid tumors. We first observed that treatment of fenbendazole to colon cancer cells induced apoptosis within 24 hours, which was extended for a long-term. We revealed that fenbendazole markedly suppressed proliferation rate via cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle progression is elaborately regulated by multiple genes, such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). From a screening of cell cycle-related factors, we found that the protein levels of CDK1 phosphorylated at Tyr15 and cyclin B1 which was known to regulate M phase transition, were drastically downregulated when the tumor cells were exposed to fenbendazole. Next, colorectal tumor-bearing mouse model was established using AOM\/DSS. Oral administration of fenbendazole into the mouse not only reduced the number of tumor cells but also lowered tumor grades. Overall, our study suggested a possibility that fenbendazole could be applied for anti-cancer therapy by targeting cell cycle arrest.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/021f7843-4594-4129-8a67-83531008b135\/@B03B8ZKp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Control of cell cycle progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Cell cycle arrest,Organoids,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13258"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyung-Sun Kang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Da-Hyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Chemo- and radio- therapy are in most cases ineffective, while Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy delays average tumor recurrence by a few months. It is widely accepted that tumor reappearance is a result of the proliferation of residual glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) subpopulation, which escaped surgery. Long-term TTFields stimulation in i<i>n vitro<\/i> experiments mimic glioblastoma cells recrudescence. After the first three days of TTFields exposure, cell growth is totally inhibited. However, in prolonged experiments, despite the chronic presence of TTFields stimulation, glioblastoma cells reestablish the ability to proliferate, even if at low rate. At the end of twelve days, exponentially growing cells show an increase of stemness markers, a drop of the membrane resistance with a related increase of membrane current, and an average depolarized membrane potential. Twelve days of TTFields treatment resulted in progressive increase in GSCs in the tumor cell population from 10% to more than 30%. Our long-term goal is to improve TTFields antitumoral activity by linking brain stimulation with a pharmacological strategy targeting GSC proliferation. The objective of our study is to test the therapeutic potential of combining TTFields exposure with the inhibition of the protein transmembrane Chloride Intracellular Channel 1 (tmCLIC1), which is crucial for GSCs proliferation. tmCLIC1 activity increases under oxidative stress conditions. Preliminary experiments using the INOVITRO-LIVE system showed a cytoplasmic oxidation increase under acute TTFields stimulation. tmCLIC1 impairment by ion channel specific antagonists affected the G1\/S checkpoint and hence, tumor cell proliferation. Targeting synergically different glioblastoma cell cycle checkpoints, G2\/M with TTFields stimulation and G1\/S with tmCLIC1 inhibition, would include the vast majority of glioblastoma cell population. Combination TTFields exposure and tmCLIC1 ion channel inhibition could represent an efficacious step forward in the treatment of glioblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9b9f2fb6-478e-4718-9f65-a35c9f2b868d\/@B03B8ZKp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Control of cell cycle progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Reactive oxygen species,Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Cancer stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13259"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michele Mazzanti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefania Castiglione<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Ranucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaetano Cannavale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Cianci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Verduci<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our study analyzed the relative telomere length in adenomas, precursor lesions of colorectal adenocarcinoma. We investigated if the accelerated telomere length shortening occurs before potential malignant transformation to adenocarcinoma and corresponds with clinicopathological characteristics.<br \/>Relative telomere length was measured in 145 patients using multiplex qPCR. We have recorded significant shortening of telomeres in the adenoma tissue compared to adjacent mucosa (Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, p &#60; 0.0001). Further, we have observed a weak inverse relationship between both adenoma and mucosa telomere length and age (Spearman's and Pearson's correlation, p = 0.021 and p = 0.027, respectively), contrary to our previous study of colorectal cancer patients (n = 696), where the inverse correlation of telomere length was detected only in the non-malignant mucosa (Pearson's correlation, p = 0.029). However, the telomere length ratio of adenoma to adjacent mucosa did not correspond with the degree of dysplasia according to the Vienna classification (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.572). Also, there was no difference in the telomere length ratio among histological types of adenomas and no association with the adenoma localization in proximal and distal colon or rectum (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.648 and p = 0.459, respectively).<br \/>Preliminary results indicate that telomere shortening occurs indeed as early as in a stage of adenomatous polyps, and it is less pronounced in adenomas compared to cancerous cells. However, the relative telomere length does not seem to correspond with adenoma progression towards malignancy. In planned experiments, we intend to assess mitochondrial DNA damage caused by 8-oxoguanine DNA adducts. These major oxidative base lesions can arise from endogenous reactive oxygen species and impact, among other things, the integrity of telomeres through double-strand breaks to DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is more prone to accumulation of oxidative damage than nuclear DNA and thus might be useful as an early, additional indicator of the precancerous character of adenoma. The study will reveal whether increased mitochondrial DNA damage and telomere loss are commonly present and linked together in adenomas.<br \/>This study was supported by the Charles University (project GA UK No. 120, UNCE\/MED\/006) and the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (21-04607X, 21-27902S).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/136b9b4a-1fa7-46eb-a16e-529eec5e8f31\/@C03B8ZKq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Telomeres and telomerase,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenoma,Telomeres,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13262"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kristyna Tomasova<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michal Kroupa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Siskova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josef Horak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ondrej Vycital<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vaclav Liska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludmila Vodickova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pavel Vodicka<\/i><\/presenter>.

Apoptosis data indicate that R cells treated with ribociclib and fulvestrant or in triplet combination with copanlisib (PI3K alpha\/delta inhibitor) are more resistant to treatment than P cells, in which a robust increase in apoptosis is seen. 3D matrigel-based clonogenic assay was performed for 15 days in P, H, and R cells to show the ineffectiveness of ribociclib to block the growth of colonies in R as compared to P cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated RB phosphorylation was abrogated in R cells compared to P cells. The H cells have an intermediary state of resistance as compared to R cells. pMEK, pERK, and pP90RSK were significantly upregulated in R cells compared to P cells. Copanlisib was found to block the AKT and S6RP signal in all three P, H, and R cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> R cells bear a characteristic signature of alterations in cell signaling involving the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MAPK pathways in response to ribociclib. Compared to P cells, R cells showed significant activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway, while the PI3K-AKT pathway was not altered. Network rewiring of the adaptive resistance using these pair of cell lines will provide an opportunity to study early adaptive response to ribociclib towards understanding and evolving combating strategies in BC following the emergence of resistance to ribociclib. Sequencing genomic alterations in the resistant cell lines are being carried out, and will be presented at the conference.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8091c362-66e7-449a-bfe8-74c015a4137e\/@C03B8ZKq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK inhibitor,Resistance,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13261"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer Carlson Aske<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pradip De<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nandini Dey<\/i><\/presenter>.

In different tumor cell lines RNA interference mediated knockdown of CDK8 results in significant inhibition of tumor cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. CDK8, therefore, represents an interesting target for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs.<br \/>Various compounds targeting CDK8\/Cyclin C with high potency in low nanomolar range have been reported. These compounds differ with respect to their binding modes, but all of them show high potency in biochemical assays, inhibition of tumor cell growth, and for many <i>in vivo<\/i> activities in different tumor cell xenograft models have been demonstrated.<br \/>CDK8 binds to Cyclin C resulting in the active protein kinases complex. CDK8\/Cyclin C interacts with MED12 and MED13, two proteins that regulate CDK8\/Cyclin C activity and its interaction with the mediator complex. Mediator consists of 26 subunits and the interaction of the CDK8\/Cyclin C\/MED12\/Med13 complex with mediator enables CDK8\/Cyclin C to regulate gene transcription via C-terminal phosphorylation of RNA-polymerase II. This mechanism mediates an indirect regulation of transcription factors such as &#223;-catenin. In addition of its function via phosphorylation of RNA-polymerase II, CDK8\/Cyclin C can also directly regulate the activity of transcription factors by phosphorylation. Best known examples are STAT1 and STAT5 which are phosphorylated by CDK8\/Cyclin C on serine 727 and Serine 726, respectively. Recent data indicates that mutations of MED12 can result in a reduced sensitivity of CDK8\/Cyclin C towards certain published CDK8\/Cyclin C inhibitor in a cellular context. In this study we performed real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses to characterize the effect of different type I and type II CDK8\/Cyclin C inhibitors on the cellular expression of selected genes controlled by two CDK8\/Cyclin C dependent pathways, namely the WNT\/&#223;-catenin- and the STAT-pathway. Furthermore, results of qPCR analyses of tumors derived from human xenograft <i>in vivo<\/i> models treated with type I and type II CDK8\/Cyclin C inhibitors will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8e6da24a-2854-4d86-9c0d-c8c702b37a7f\/@C03B8ZKq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK8,Inhibitors,Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),Transcription,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13260"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laura M.

Due to lack of therapeutic agents, patients&#8217; overall survival rate has been decreased. Gemcitabine is the only well-known drug to treat pancreatic cancer patients but less effective. Therefore, it is significantly required to discover and develop novel therapeutic agents for PDAC therapy. The present study represents the first study evaluating the anticancer efficacy of niclosamide in PDAC. Here, we found that niclosamide co-treatment with gemcitabine inhibited pancreatic cancer cells compared with gemcitabine alone by suppressing the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, niclosamide co-treatment with gemcitabine inhibited cell proliferation as determined by MTS assay and induced cell apoptosis as determined by Annexin V and PI staining. Further, niclosamide induced G1 arrest of the cell cycle as evidenced by down-regulated CDK4\/6 and Cyclin D1 expression. Our findings proved that combining niclosamide and Gemcitabine effectively down-regulates the tumor size and growth in pancreatic cancer. Altogether, our results indicate that niclosamide synergistically enhances the antitumor effect with treating gemcitabine by inducing the ubiquitination and degradation of &#946;-catenin in pancreatic cancer and could be a novel potential candidate for PDAC therapy.Key words: PDAC, Niclosamide, Gemcitabine, &#946;-catenin ubiquitination, Apoptosis, Cell cycle","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03e96f77-bc70-4509-b71e-6310fa898ee7\/@C03B8ZKq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Niclosamide,&#946;-catenin ubiquitination,Gemcitabine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19943"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>HyeonWoong Kang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>JoonSeong Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>YunSun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daeun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>HyoJung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Several studies showed that the ivermectin has antitumor effects on a variety of cancer cells. The present study represents the first study evaluating the anticancer efficacy of ivermectin in pancreatic cancer. We found that the anticancer effect of ivermectin in combination with gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer is more effective than gemcitabine alone. Ivermectin-gemcitabine combination inhibited cell proliferation via G1 arrest of the cell cycle, as evidenced by down-regulated cyclin D1 expression through mTOR\/STAT3 signaling pathway. In addition, ivermectin-gemcitabine induced apoptosis by ROS generation and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and blocked mitophagy. In vivo experiments also confirmed that ivermectin-gemcitabine groups significantly suppressed the tumor growth of pancreatic cancer compared with gemcitabine alone groups. These results indicate that ivermectin has a synergistic effect with gemcitabine in preventing cancer progression and could be a potential antitumor drug for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
