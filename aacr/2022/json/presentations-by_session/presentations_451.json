[{"Abstract":"Metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients. During metastatic dissemination, circulating tumor cells need to survive in the bloodstream and their interaction with platelets through P-selectin-ligand seems to be crucial. It has been demonstrated that heparin (from porcine mucosa, porcine UFH), a glycosaminoglycan composed by repetitive disaccharides of uronic acid and glucosamine, may interfere with P-selectin interaction. Recently our research group purified by ion exchange chromatography a fraction of bovine heparin displaying very low anticoagulant potential, named LABH (~20 IU\/mg LABH x ~200 IU\/mg porcine UFH x ~100 IU\/mg bovine UFH). The advantage of bovine UFH and, especially of LABH, is their reduced risk of bleeding side effect. Our aim in this work was to investigate the potential use of LABH as an antimetastatic agent <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, evaluating its ability to interfere with tumor cell-platelet interaction, tumor cell binding to P-selectin and preventing induced metastasis in mice. For this, we challenged 8-12 weeks C57Bl\/6 mice with 4 or 8 mg\/kg of porcine UFH, bovine UFH or LABH followed by intravenous injection of B16F10 cells (murine melanoma cell line). After 21 days, lungs were analyzed and metastatic foci were counted. The number of metastatic foci was significantly reduced when animals were pretreated with heparins (50-70 foci in control mice and 10-15 in treated mice). In other attempt, isolated platelets from healthy volunteers were incubated for 1h with MV3 cells (human melanoma cell line) <i>in vitro<\/i> in the presence or absence of heparin. All three heparins tested were efficient in blocking MV3-platelet interaction in a dose-response manner, but LABH required higher doses than porcine and bovine UFH. When analyzing the direct binding of U937 cell (human lymphoma cell line) to immobilized P-selectin, we could observe that porcine and bovine UFH inhibited at the same level (~ 60% of inhibition with 100 &#956;g\/mL), while LABH was less effective (~ 45% of inhibition with 100 &#956;g\/mL). Collectively our results demonstrate that despite presenting distinct patterns of sulfation and anticoagulant potential, all heparins significantly reduced lung metastasis, platelet-tumor cell adhesion and P-selectin binding. On the other hand, we hypothesize that LABH may act suppressing metastasis also by other mechanisms since its effect on <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments was less pronounced in comparison to porcine and bovine UFH.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ac627b3c-e4e5-457f-9ff7-3d1588f8c276\/@r03B8ZLM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Therapeutic target,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11768"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juliana Maria Motta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Roberto-Fernandes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kayene Vitória Andrade Micheli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Maria Freire Tovar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paulo Antônio Souza Mourão<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariana Sá Pereira<\/i><\/presenter>.

CRC that metastasizes to distance sites results in poor prognosis, diminished survival, and reduced effectiveness of treatments. Perineural invasion (PNI) is an emerging field that aims to understand cancer-neuronal crosstalk that enables cancer to spread via nerves. Several studies have indicated that tumor derived exosomes (TDEs) play significant roles in the initiation and spread of cancer, along with driving chemoresistance. We hypothesize that CRC derived exosomes alter nerves within the surrounding environment and result in recruitment of nerves towards tumors for invasion along the nerve. Exosomes from both HCT116 and SW837 colon cancer cells were isolated and purified using a modified iodixanol ultracentrifugation gradient technique. A Proteomic analysis conducted on cancer derived exosomes revealed several potential proteins involved in neuronal growth and migration, including Vinculin (VCL), Periostin (POSTN or OSF-2), DCLK1, and USP9X. In another set of experiments, conditioned media (CM) from HCT116 and SW837 cells were added to both PC12 neuronal-like cells and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) from C57BL\/6J mice to understand the effects of excreted cancer factors on neuronal outgrowth and differentiation. CM studies showed how signaling factors excreted from colon cancer cells induce increased nerite outgrowth in both PC12 cells and DRG. These results were not seen in CM from cancer cells that were grown in the presence of an exosome inhibitor. Altogether, these results indicate that CRC utilizes exosomes to alter the adjacent neuronal networks as a means to employ surrounding nerves for invasion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10cd2673-3104-4b19-847e-700e47f75c01\/@r03B8ZLM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Colorectal cancer,Microenvironment,Perineural Invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11801"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Colewyn Knoblich<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khosrow Rezvani<\/i><\/presenter>.

This is seen by the drastic decline in survival rates following tumor escape from the primary site. A key promoter of metastasis is tumor hypoxia, or low oxygen concentration. Our lab previously demonstrated that Proviral Integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM)-1, a serine-threonine kinase, is upregulated in hypoxia and that inhibition of PIM1 reduced metastatic occurrence in orthotopic mouse models. Here, we identify a novel signaling pathway that links hypoxia and PIM kinase to the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. An unbiased screen to discover new PIM substrates in hypoxia identified Abl-Interactor 2 (Abi2), an integral member of the actin regulating Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC), as a novel PIM kinase substrate. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that phosphorylation of Abi2 at our identified PIM sites increases Abi2 stability. Overexpression of PIM1 increases Abi2 and other WRC members at the protein level, resulting in increased actin protrusions and cell motility. CRISPR-generated Abi2 knockout cell lines showed diminished protrusive activity and negated both the necessity and sufficiency of PIM kinase to increases protrusive activity in cancer cells. Lastly, <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments show that overexpression of PIM1 increases tumor invasion into the surrounding tissue in an Abi2-dependent manner, and small molecule PIM inhibitors significantly reduce invasion. In summary, we uncovered a novel role for PIM1 in promoting cellular motility and protrusion, identified novel phosphorylation sites that control the stability of Abi2 in normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and highlight a novel PIM1\/Abi2 signaling axis that regulates hypoxia-induced tumor invasion. This research provides important insight in the role of PIM signaling in prostate tumors and yields preclinical evidence for further use of PIM kinase inhibitors as a means to inhibit tumor invasion, a key driving step in the formation of lethal prostate cancer metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/33799627-51b7-4c89-9216-a5db44cc6537\/@r03B8ZLM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,PIM kinase,Invasion,Actin cytoskeleton,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11804"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Corbin C.

Studies from our group reveal that NE may be a prognostic marker of metastasis. In a cohort of 192 breast cancer patients (58% ER\/PR+ve, 20%-HER-2 +ve and 22% TNBC), our results show that higher infiltration of NE-positive Tumor Associated Neutrophils (TANs), is associated with a decrease in recurrence free survival (hazard ratio=3.4, 95% CI, 1.1-5.5), regardless of breast cancer subtype Further, we observe that the genetic deletion of <i>Elane<\/i> (encoding NE) inhibits lung metastasis in <i>in vivo<\/i> models of breast cancer. Yet the precise mechanism(s) by which NE promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer remains to be elucidated. To address this gap in knowledge, we have identified the tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms by which NE promotes metastasis.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The role of NE in breast cancer metastasis was assessed using Elane<sup>+\/+<\/sup> and Elane<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice in FVB\/NJ genetic background, bearing PyMT tumors (orthotopic and spontaneous) respectively. These mice develop lung metastasis in 80-90% of the tumor-bearing mice within 1-3 months of primary tumor initiation. To assess metastasis-free survival (MFS), mice received orthotopic engraftment of PyMT tumors, followed by resection and subsequent monitoring for metastasis. The efficacy of the NE inhibitor AZD9668 was assessed in Elane<sup>+\/+<\/sup> mouse models by treating the mice with 100mg\/kg B.I.D treatments.<br \/><b>Preliminary results:<\/b> Genetic ablation of NE (Elane<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) in the PyMT models, reduced lung metastasis by ~90% (Lung metastatic index =21.8 vs. 2.7, respectively; p=0.0044). Survival studies in FVB Elane<sup>-\/-<\/sup> showed a MFS benefit of 345 days compared to controls, which succumbed to metastasis-related death in 46 days post primary tumor resection. RNA-sequencing analysis of PyMT- Elane<sup>+\/+<\/sup> and Elane<sup>-\/-<\/sup> tumors showed differential regulation of tumor intrinsic actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling pathways between the two genetic backgrounds. These NE-regulated pathways are critical for cell-to-cell contact and tissue integrity, explaining the delay in metastasis in the Elane<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice. 100mg\/kg daily treatment of AZD9668 reduced lung metastasis in PyMT mice by 94% compared to vehicle-treated mice (0.49+\/- 0.21% vs. 0.03+\/-0.01%; p=0.05) and significantly reduced instances of primary tumor recurrence.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Collectively, our studies suggest that genetic and pharmacological ablation of NE reduces metastasis and extends MFS in <i>in vivo<\/i> models of breast cancer. Our preclinical studies presented here are likely to provide the much-needed rationale for the use of this class of NE inhibitors as a viable treatment strategy for the metastatic breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d4a33c48-69c4-40f4-b698-73034e1b8f67\/@r03B8ZLM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-09 Metastasis suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Breast cancer,Therapeutics,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11831"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amriti R.

Detached cells from the ECM are often cleared by a death process called &#8216;anoikis&#8217;. Anoikis is critical for health and homeostasis maintenance. However, aggressive cancer cells acquire anoikis resistance to promote invasion and metastasis in new sites. We previously identified metabolic reprogramming and upregulation of Vacuolar-ATPase members responsible for anoikis resistance while the manipulation of these pathways induced anoikis. However, the mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance and subsequent metastasis are yet to be fully elucidated, thus limiting anoikis-targeting drug exploration for metastasis control. Herein, our RNA-seq data revealed upregulated genes associated with proteasome activity (such as PSMA, PSMB, PSMD, and POMP) in ECM detached cancer cells compared to adherent cancer cells. Targeting this, using proteasome inhibitors (MG132 or bortezomib) in breast cancer, cervical, and melanoma cell lines sensitized cancer cells to anoikis through increased cellular, mitochondrial stress, and misfolded protein accumulation. Moreover, Bortezomib treatment <i>in vivo<\/i> in melanoma tumor model repressed metastasis. These data demonstrate proteasome activity is hijacked by ECM detached cancer cells to maintain proteostasis thus promoting anoikis resistance and metastasis. Regardless of the impressive outcome in treating hematological malignancies, proteasome inhibitors show little effect against solid tumors in several clinical trials that utilized selective and more potent inhibitors either as a single or in combinatory therapy. In this sense, our finding suggests proteasome inhibitors may be more attractive for metastasis control rather than local tumor treatment. Altogether, our findings demonstrate enhanced proteasome activity within the tumor cells is critical for anoikis resistance, and targeting this can markedly overcome resistance and control tumor metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13bbe33a-fa71-4909-9779-7c6e1906869e\/@r03B8ZLM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,Anoikis,Proteasome inhibitors,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11780"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Funmilayo Adeshakin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guizhong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adeleye Adeshakin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaochun Wan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Yet, molecular mechanisms supporting the formation of these lesions from CRC are unknown. We aimed to explore drivers enabling tropism and adaptation of CRC cells to the brain environment and decipher mechanisms facilitating the process. We analyzed the FoundationOne database, which contains genomic alterations data of cancer-related genes in over 16,000 human CRC primary and metastasis samples. Increased prevalence of IRS2 gene amplification was observed in 13% of BM, compared to only 3% of primary tumors or other metastatic sites. IRS2 is a cytoplasmic adaptor mediating effects of insulin and IGF-1 receptors and is involved in more aggressive behavior of different cancer types. In agreement with the genomic data, immunohistochemistry of human clinical samples showed increased expression of IRS2 protein in BM. We constructed an in vitro system mimicking the brain microenvironment using cultured human astrocytes or their conditioned media. Under these conditions, IRS2-overexpressed CRC cells survived better and formed larger 3D spheres. IRS2-silenced CRC cells showed a mirror image. Moreover, in an intracranial CRC BM mouse model, IRS2-overexpressed cells generated larger brain lesions, while silencing IRS2 dramatically decreased tumor outgrowth and extended survival. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis revealed enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathways by IRS2. Indeed, IRS2-expressing cells showed increased mitochondrial activity and glycolysis-independent viability. Furthermore, IRS2-expressing cells had increased &#946;-catenin transcriptional activity. Interestingly, &#946;-catenin inhibition (using ICG-001) or IRS2 inhibition (using NT219) in IRS2-expressing cells decreased their viability, &#946;-catenin transcriptional activity, and mitochondrial activity, suggesting involvement of IRS2 in modulating OXPHOS through &#946;-catenin. &#946;-catenin is known to confer 5-FU resistance; consequently, we showed that combination of 5-FU and NT219 worked in synergy, inhibited the formation of BM, and extended animal survival. These data reveal, for the first time, the unique genomic profile of CRC BM and imply the IRS2 role in promoting CRC BM. These effects may be mediated, at least in part, by modulation of the &#946;-catenin and OXPHOS pathway.

Due to CTC rarity and limited stability, no CTC-derived xenograft (CDX) models have ever been generated from non-metastatic NSCLC patients directly. Alternative strategies are needed to molecularly characterize CTCs in this potentially curable patient group.<br \/>Methods: Surgically resected NSCLC primary tumor tissues were implanted in immunodeficient mice to establish ten patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). CTCs from 2\/10 PDX models led to generation of two stable metastatic models that were studied by single cell sequencing.<br \/>Results: Single cell analysis revealed an additional alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) population in metastatic tumors, besides a common AT2 cluster in PDX\/metastatic tumors. This was consistent with an external validation set analysis in primary and metastatic NSCLC patient tumors. Further, AT2 clusters of metastatic tumors expressed higher cancer stemness genes versus primary PDX tumor that was recapitulated in patients primary and metastatic tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Stable metastatic models from early stage NSCLC patients can be generated with CTCs from PDX models. The distinct AT2 population identified in CDX tumors with cancer stemness features might be critical mediator of metastasis that deserves further study to discover personalized strategies against NSCLC micrometastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7bb6a8df-4f8c-4427-9e44-241e847817c7\/@r03B8ZLM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11833"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kanve Nagaraj Suvilesh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yulia I.

Aquaporins (AQPs), transmembrane water transport proteins, have been linked to tumor growth, metastasis, and more invasive phenotypes. However, the exact mechanisms behind AQP dysregulation and its role in mediating cancer migration remain unknown. Physical cues and extracellular signals from the tumor microenvironment have been implicated in the progression of cancer; yet the role AQPs play in sensing and signaling have yet to be elucidated. Recent studies have shown the paracrine signaling within the tumor microenvironment is mediated in part by cell secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are membrane-delimited nanoparticles capable of protecting and transporting protein and nucleic acid cargo for intercellular communication. EV mediated paracrine signaling has been shown to participate in various steps of tumor progression. Cells are also able to sense complex mechanical signals from the tumor microenvironment to direct more invasive cellular responses. Understanding the role AQPs play in sensing and signaling within the tumor microenvironment can provide a more holistic view of the way AQPs influence cancer progression.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods: <\/b>To study the role of AQP containing EVs and AQPs influence on mechanotransduction to facilitate cancer cell migration, this study has employed 3D <i>in vitro <\/i>models, including microfluidic devices, to recapitulate relevant <i>in vivo <\/i>conditions in concert with confocal microscopy to understand cell behaviors. EVs were isolated via tangential flow filtration. AQP levels were down regulated with siRNA complex or upregulated via AQP5-GFP plasmids.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Knocking down AQPs with siRNAs, confirmed with western blotting, was shown to reduce cellular migration on 2D surfaces and in confining microenvironments. We have also found that AQPs can enhance the integrin mediated mechanotransduction pathway, which has been implicated in cell proliferation and migration. Effects of integrin mediated mechanotransduction were reversed by suppressing AQP expression. Finally, we have made the exciting discovery that cancer cells secrete extracellular vesicles that contain AQPs. These EVs could be released into the tumor microenvironment to enhance tumor migration. Further work is being conducted to elucidate the AQP-EV relationship.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0dcf40c4-5e58-4254-b882-e56d60a838a4\/@r03B8ZLM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aquaporin,Extracellular vesicles,Cancer progression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11823"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ian Smith<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison Moses<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Kronstadt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Jay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Stroka<\/i><\/presenter>.

The crosstalk between BC cells and bone resident cells dramatically increases osteoclast activity, resulting in the release of growth factors from the bone matrix that causes aggressive tumor growth and bone loss. A potentially important aspect of this process is vesicular trafficking on microtubules (MTs) which can affect the output of signaling pathways and secretory activity of metastatic bone cells. MTs are cytoskeletal filaments composed of heterodimers, &#945;- and &#946;-tubulin. The tubulin isotypes and their variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs) control the properties and functions of MT filaments, a concept known as the &#8216;tubulin code&#8217;. Recent studies show an emerging link between alterations of the tubulin code with poor prognosis of breast cancer. However, the regulation of the code in metastatic bone cells is currently unknown. Tubulin acetylation occurs via &#945;-tubulin N-acetyl transferase-1 (&#945;TAT1) and can be reversed by histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6). MTs lacking acetylation lose flexural rigidity and are prone to breaks following repetitive bending during vesicular trafficking. We found that HDAC6 interaction with &#945;-tubulin is inhibited by a Runt-related factor (Runx2). Our biochemical, mass spectrometry and IPs analyses of MTs revealed that loss of Runx2 can reduce (i) acetylation and stability of MTs, (ii) interaction of HSP90 with &#945;-tubulin, and (iii) levels of &#946; 2a-tubulin. Our studies with Runx2 mutants indicate that the C-terminal of Runx2 serves a scaffolding function by interacting with MTs and HDAC6. Confocal microscopy revealed reduced puncta and altered distribution of endosomal vesicles and autophagosomes with Runx2 silencing. As MT targeting agents are often used as chemotherapeutics, we found that loss of Runx2 sensitizes breast cancer cells to docetaxel and vinblastine and reduces the secretion of IL-6. We found MDA-MB-231 cells metastasized to the bone show significant differences in microtubule isotype expression, with 10 of 19 studied showing 1.3 to 4.1 fold increases. Further analysis of whether Runx2 knockdown affects isotype expression, we found the majority of the 19 studied remain unchanged. Immunohistochemistry for Ac-&#945;-Tub levels in bone metastatic patient samples shows significantly more Ac-&#945;-Tub positive cells in metastatic bone tumors than primary tumors. These findings suggest a novel control mechanism of MTs stability via Runx2-HDAC6 interactions that can impact trafficking and cellular activity. Our results indicate that inhibition of Runx2 may sensitize metastatic tumors to MT targeting agents, and Runx2\/HDAC6\/Ac-&#945;-Tub levels may serve as markers for metastatic tumors to help stratify patients for optimal treatment for metastatic bone disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ccd81d01-6127-4163-ab1d-a3f55f67f3db\/@s03B8ZLN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,Microtubules,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11874"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shreya Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus Winogradzki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmad Othman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Waddell Holmes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jitesh Pratap<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We hypothesized that patients with lung cancer will have detectable peripheral MDSCs with CCR2 and CCR5 expression preoperatively, that it would decrease immediately postoperatively, and then increase longitudinally if tumor recurs.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: As part of a prospective longitudinal study, whole blood samples were obtained from patients suspected to have primary lung cancer prior to surgery. Patients were excluded if they were minors, could not provider consent, had malignancy within the past 10 years or any immunosuppressive condition. Blood samples were obtained prior to surgery or at follow-up in clinic and processed within 1 hour of acquisition. We stained samples via 2 different methods: 1) whole blood and 2) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) extracted from Ficoll density gradient and determined that whole blood staining had superior results. Samples were analyzed via flow cytometer and gated after defining MO (monocytic)-MDSCs as CD33<sup>+<\/sup>HLADR<sup>low\/-<\/sup>CD14<sup>+<\/sup> and PMN-MDSCs as CD33<sup>+<\/sup>HLADR<sup>-<\/sup>CD15<sup>+<\/sup>. MDSCs were reported as a percentage of live leukocytes and means were reported with T-test performed for statistical analysis.<br \/>Results: A total of 18 patients were recruited with a median age of 69 years (63.8-75) and 61% (11\/18) females. Adenocarcinoma was present in 16, carcinoid tumor in 1 and both adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumor in 1 patient. Stage I and Stage II were the most common (66.7% and 22.2%, respectively). Majority of the tumors were in the right upper lobe (55.6%). There were 7 healthy controls with a median age of 29 years (28-43) and 71% females. There was a significantly increased proportion of MO-MDSCs in NSCLC patients preoperatively compared to healthy controls (11.64% versus 5.02%, p = 0.02). CCR2+CCR5+ MO-MDSCs were 0.85% in patients versus 0.06% in controls (p=0.04). No differences were noted with PMN-MDSCs. Five patients had post-operative follow up (mean 152 days) with an average decrease of 63% in MO-MDSCs, 68% in CCR2+CCR5+ MO-MDSCs and no recurrence of tumor on CT scans.<br \/>Conclusion: Early results of this on-going study demonstrate the detection of circulating CCR2+CCR5+ MO-MDSCs in the preoperative whole blood of NSCLC patients compared to healthy controls. Resection of the tumor is associated with a decrease of these MO-MDSCs after treatment. We are evaluating if any increase in CCR2+CCR5+ MO-MDSC in long term will allow us to use it as an adjuvant tool along with CT monitoring as a biomarker of residual or recurrent disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4b98bfe4-110d-424f-887b-3042f778eb04\/@s03B8ZLN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDSC,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Recurrence,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11875"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hamza Khan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anas Awan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Shishikura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carley Blevins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Rodgers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuping Mei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wasay Nizam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shun Ishiyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Battafarano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Errol Bush<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Broderick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hajime Orita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ada Tam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinny Ha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Franck Housseau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malcolm Brock<\/i><\/presenter>.

Given the incidence of this disease and the lack of adequate treatments currently available, PMs pose a large unmet clinical need. Although PMs can be accompanied by more widespread metastatic disease, it often occurs as the only sign of dissemination. This implies that the route of metastatic spread to the peritoneum differs from that to distant organs. PMs are thought to result from cancer cells that spill into the abdominal cavity, and are able to attach to the peritoneal lining and form tumor deposits. This cascade places specific demands on the cancer cells.<br \/>Here, we report that colorectal cancers that present with PMs almost universally classify as consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4). This previously recognized disease entity is characterized by mesenchymal features, poor prognosis, and resistance to therapies currently used against peritoneal metastases, which explains their limited efficacy. By leveraging disease models that capture CMS4-specific features, including the ability to form PMs <i>in vivo<\/i>, we identified elesclomol as a highly effective agent. Elesclomol kills cancer cells in a copper-dependent fashion by targeting the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, which we found to be a specific vulnerability of CMS4 cancers. Elesclomol-Cu<sup>2+<\/sup> was effective following only minutes of exposure to CMS4 cell lines and organoids, supporting its use in intra-abdominal treatment procedures. It is therefore a promising candidate for the local treatment of peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/181caf49-da7f-44e2-8690-9dceac215384\/@s03B8ZLN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peritoneal metastasis,Small molecule drugs,Molecular subtypes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11878"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanne Bootsma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark P.

PCBMs are predominantly osteoblastic with mixed, and lytic regions; all of which compromise bone strength. How PCs alter bone structure is unresolved. Prolonged use of modern androgen receptor (AR) targeting agents has increased development of AR pathway-independent PC phenotypes. We hypothesize that defining the structural changes, cellular composition, and PC classification of PCBM-affected bone will help reveal mechanisms of PCBM pathology, and identify potential therapeutic opportunities. We analyze the 3D structure of 14 cadaveric PCBM lumbar vertebrae using micro-computed tomography (microCT). We performed scanning electron microscopy quantitative backscattering electron (qBSE), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to determine mineral morphology and composition. We analyzed sequential decalcified sections for collagen structure, fibril orientation, and extracellular matrix composition using bright field and polarized light microscopy. We determined lesion structure and cell distribution from two PCBM vertebral specimens resected during decompression surgery using histology and immunohistochemistry, and characterized PCBM cell populations using single cell RNA sequencing (sc RNA Seq) on one vertebral specimen. MicroCT imaging revealed three distinct dysmorphic bone patterns: 1) osteolytic, defined by thinned broken trabecula of well-organized mineral and collagen structures; 2) osteoblastic, with disorganized matrix deposited on pre-existing trabecula; and 3) osteoblastic, with little, if any, residual trabecula, and dominated by accumulation of disorganized mineralized matrix. qBSE and EDX revealed heterogeneous mineral composition, with higher variability in mineral content. Disorganized matrix had a higher voids or &#8220;lacunae&#8221; density, poorly organized collagen fiber alignment, and higher decorin and pan-proteoglycan content. Sc RNA Seq revealed a PCBM tumor microenvironment composed of a variety of immune cells, hematopoietic progenitors, and bone resident cells. Importantly, we identified AR-high, AR-low, and double-negative PC cells in the same lesion, with minimum neuroendocrine component. Simultaneous presence of these PC phenotypes was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Morphologically, AR-positive cells adopt two configurations in PCBM, i) clusters within bone cavities in which cells maintain secretory polarization and resemble prostate acini, and ii) diffuse cells in intimate contact with bone-resident cells that lack polarization. PCBM lesions have abnormal bone structures lacking collagen organization, and with mineral heterogeneity consistent with bone weakness. PC cells interact with bone cells, but how distinct PC phenotypes affect bone turnover and structure need further analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55d28bce-4da4-4a55-ab22-21bc27720e23\/@s03B8ZLN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-06 Imaging of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Bone,Metastasis,Structure-activity relationships,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11879"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Felipe Eltit<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raphaële Charest-Morin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colm Morrissey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Corey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rizhi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael E.

EVs are a heterogeneous group of cell-released membranous structures, which contain a wide mixture of active molecules. Each cell type secretes a unique combination of different EV subpopulations that vary in size, content and function. In GBM, the subfraction of small-EVs derived from multivesicular bodies, also referred as exosomes (EXOs), have received considerable attention for their capacity to create a tumor-supportive microenvironment through their actions on immune cells, vasculature and glial cells. Only recently it has been observed that large-EVs formed by the budding of the cell membrane, classically called microvesicles (MVs), are more abundant than EXOs in the plasma of GBM patients. Large-MVs have been associated with disease progression in the context of prostate cancer, but their functional significance remain largely uncharacterized in GBM. To explore EV migratory potential in the GBM context, an in vitro migration test performed on spheroids of patient-derived Glioma Stem-like Cells (GSC) has been set up. EXOs from GSC culture supernatants exert no migratory effects, whereas MVs triggered remarkable cell migration. Differently from GSC culture supernatants, both EXOs and MVs isolated from surgical washing exerted a remarkable migratory effect suggesting that not only EVs from tumoral cells are actively implicated in GSC mobility but also EVs from the non-tumoral microenvironment act synergistically to sustain GBM invasion. To better understand the contribution of the cell sub-population of the tumor environment, an EV separation based on CD45(leukocyte common antigen) expression was performed. CD45-positive EVs (released by immune cells) and CD45-negative EVs (released by tumor and stroma cells) were employed in the spheroid migration assay. Results showed the absence of any migratory effect of CD45-positive subsets, both EXOs and MVs, indicating that EVs selectively generated by tumor and stroma cells play a key role in tumoral invasion. Furthermore, a multiplex bead-based flow-cytometry analysis performed on EVs from six GBM patients revealed the presence of specific antigen clusters related to migration and could also be investigated as tumoral biomarkers in a liquid biopsy context.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bee35455-cbd5-4032-8720-b4443de38f2d\/@s03B8ZLN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Extracellular vesicles,Motility,Tumor markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11880"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Valentino Ribecco<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Tamborini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabetta Stanzani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Pizzocri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Milena Mattioli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Olei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Pia Tropeano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federico Pessina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michela Matteoli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorena Passoni<\/i><\/presenter>.

To investigate mechanisms of APA action in CRPC, <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>studies were performed to characterize the effects of APA on prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, and the expression of genes that regulate these processes. Exposure to 40 or 80 nM concentrations of APA for 24 hr inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP cells in both the presence and absence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). APA also inhibited LNCaP cell migration\/invasion in the Boyden chamber assay. At the mRNA level (RT-PCR), APA down-regulated the expression of androgen receptor (AR), c-Myc, MMP-2, MMP-9, DANCR, and incRNA, and up-regulated TIMP-2 expression. Similar data were obtained for protein expression (western blot): APA down-regulated expression of AR, c-Myc, PCNA, MMP-2 and MMP-9, and up-regulated expression of TIMP-2. In the <i>in vivo <\/i>study, heterozygous male Hi-Myc mice received daily oral (gavage) administration of APA at doses of 0 (vehicle), 2, or 15 mg\/kg\/day beginning at age 8 weeks. Cohorts of mice were euthanized for prostate collection after 2 months, 3.5 months, or 5 months of APA administration. Daily oral administration of both dose levels of APA reduced accessory sex gland weights by over 50% at all three time points. Confirming and extending the results of <i>in vitro <\/i>studies in LNCaP cells, RT-PCR demonstrated that APA inhibited the expression of AR, c-Myc, lncRNA, DANCR, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in the prostate of Hi-Myc mice, and upregulated the expression of TIMP-2. The maximum efficacy of APA was seen at 3.5 months of exposure. Because resistance to antiandrogen therapy commonly develops over time in clinical populations, a subline of LNCaP cells that is resistant to APA was derived and used to repeat <i>in vitro <\/i>cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and gene expression assays. The APA-resistant subline no longer expressed AR, but did express the AR variant, AR-V7. To determine whether cells can be resensitized to APA by inhibiting AR-V7 expression, AR-V7 was knocked down by siRNA. Comparisons of the effects of APA on gene expression in APA-resistant LNCaP cells and APA-resistant LNCaP cells in which AR-V7 had been knocked down demonstrated that knockdown of AR-V7 in APA-resistant LNCaP cells resensitizes those cells to APA. Although APA is an effective inhibitor of prostate cancer growth, development, and invasion in both preclinical models and clinical populations, strategies to overcome the apparent AR-V7-mediated resistance to antiandrogens are necessary to optimize its efficacy when administered over extended periods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5b12aa77-456b-406e-a090-536633dc93d0\/@s03B8ZLN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Invasion,Migration,Androgen receptor,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11881"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gina Qualter<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Genoveva Murillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinjian Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David McCormick<\/i><\/presenter>.

Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and Na,K-ATPases are particularly attractive targets as both are upregulated in many cancers and have been correlated specifically with invasiveness in vitro and metastasis and in vivo. However, their precise upstream regulators and downstream effectors remain unclear. Additionally, it has not been determined whether these transporters are co-regulated in cancer, although they display overlap in their downstream effectors and have complementary activity on sodium ions. Such a system has, however, been described in neuronal models of pain, wherein inflammatory injury leads to an upregulation in VGSC expression and a subsequent proportional increase in Na,K-ATPase. We sought to describe a similar phenomenon in cancer cells, which could indicate that this neuronal response to injury may be hijacked as a driver of metastatic development. To elucidate the impact of inflammatory mediators on these ion transporters in cancer cells, we assessed the effects of TNF&#945; and PGE2 on VGSCs and Na,K-ATPases in the human breast epithelial or cancer cells MCF-10a, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231. RT-qPCR revealed increases in RNA expression for the clinically relevant VGSC subunit Na<sub>v<\/sub>1.5. Similar RNA increases were observed in the &#945;1 and &#945;3 subunits of Na,K-ATPase, although in all cases the magnitude and time point of maximal effect differed by cell line. Then a 1hr challenge of TNF&#945; on MDA-MB-231 cells was used to examine whether the targets were independently regulated by inflammatory mediators, co-regulated via the transport of sodium ions, or co-regulated by the expression of one protein influencing the expression of the other protein. Transfection with siRNA against either the &#945;1 or &#945;3 subunit of Na,K-ATPase did not inhibit the inflammatory-mediated increase in RNA for Na<sub>v<\/sub>1.5. However, transfection with anti-Nav1.5 siRNA inhibited the upregulation of both Na,K-ATPase subunits. TNF&#945; challenge following pre-incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells in a sodium-free medium completely inhibited the inflammatory-mediated upregulation of Na<sub>v<\/sub>1.5, Na,K-ATPase &#945;1 or &#945;3 RNA. Co-incubation of TNF&#945; with the VGSC blocking drug protoxin I inhibited the inflammatory-mediated increase in Na,K-ATPase &#945;1 or &#945;3 RNA, but co-incubation with the Na,K-ATPase blocking drug ouabain did not inhibit the increase in Nav1.5 RNA and indeed may have potentiated the increase. Together these results are evidence that VGSCs and Na,K-ATPase are co-regulated by inflammatory mediators in metastatic breast cancer, that sodium is essential to this mechanism, and that the presence and ion-transporting function of VGSCs is necessary for the inflammatory-mediated effect on Na,K-ATPase but not vice versa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6fc4bb9-0a2c-4dc3-9852-02a794eca380\/@s03B8ZLN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"In vitro,Inflammation,Cell migration,Cell invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11883"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Steven D.

Many immune activity assays to detect immune cells are available, including multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) of tissue slices to assess co-localization of immune cell markers and traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. More recently, statistical approaches to define cell types from RNAseq data (e.g., deconvolution, gene set enrichment) have been widely adopted due to the wide availability of transcriptomics profiles. Here, we interrogated the level of agreement between immune cells in the ovarian TME assessed by mIF (Vectra images processed via InForm\/Halo), IHC, and deconvoluted whole exome RNAseq. We leveraged data from epithelial ovarian tumor cores embedded in tissue microarrays from participants in the Nurses&#8217; Health Study I and II and the New England Case-Control Study (mIF, n=668 women; IHC, n=467; RNAseq, n=241). To explore agreement between technologies, we calculated the overall and compartment-specific percentages of cells positive for mIF markers CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD138 and FOXP3, including cell specific phenotypes based on these markers. For IHC, a pathologist generated scores based on proportion of positive cells and\/or aggregation into four levels (0, 1, 2, or 3) for markers CD8, CD68, and CD163. Deconvolution of transcriptomic profiles was performed with CIBERSORT (22 cell types) and xCell (64 cell types). Spearman correlation between technologies for cell specific markers (i.e., cytotoxic T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), B cells, macrophages, monocytes, among others) was used to assess agreement. We observed that detection of CD8+ and CD3+CD8+ cells from mIF (cytotoxic T cells) was consistent with the other assays (<i>r<\/i> &#62;0.25), and the highest correlation was observed with IHC CD8+ cells (<i>r<\/i>=0.52). For deconvoluted transcriptomic predictions, CD8 T cells (xCell, CIBERSORT), and memory CD8 T cells (xCell) showed high agreement with mIF CD8+ and CD3+CD8+ cells (<i>r<\/i>=0.25 to 0.48). CD4+ and CD3+CD4+ cells detected with mIF also showed correlation with xCell CD4 memory T cells (<i>r<\/i>=0.25 to 0.34). As expected, only general class B cells from xCell showed agreement with mIF CD20+ cells (<i>r<\/i>=0.35). In addition, xCell Tregs correlated with mIF FOXP3+ cells (<i>r<\/i>=0.34). These results highlight the importance of considering the predictive power of immunological assays for the study of the TME. Compared to mIF, the robustness of deconvoluted RNAseq data varies with the cell type being predicted. Finally, RNAseq should be considered a complementary technology to staining of archival tissues given that the former does conserve spatial distribution of cell types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/76c6ed7e-9fcf-41cb-9c66-4da3ce2fcfc9\/@s03B8ZLN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Immunohistochemistry,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11888"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"b93eb808-8dea-4525-b786-83133674f134","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b93eb808-8dea-4525-b786-83133674f134\/@s03B8ZLN\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Oscar E.

Each are strongly influenced by the tumor microenvironment. Identification of novel methods to change the microenvironment is needed to improve the response of solid tumors, including melanoma, to therapies like immune checkpoint blockade. We and others have demonstrated that aerobic exercise remodels tumor microenvironment in multiple tumor types. Here, we present data to suggest that this exercise-induced remodeling of the tumor microenvironment is partially dependent on modulation of ERK5 in both tumor endothelium and infiltrating immune cells. The depletion of ERK5 in tumor-associated macrophages inhibits the growth of melanoma and lung carcinoma in mouse models, and the depletion of ERK5 in keratocytes prevents tumorigenesis promoted by inflammation. Multiple reports have shown the potential therapeutic approach of both ERK5 knockdown and pharmacological kinase inhibition in regulating inflammation and tumorigenesis. Here we identify the role of ERK5 S496 phosphorylation, known to promote inflammatory signaling, as a novel mediator of exercise induced tumor microenvironment alterations. Utilizing two melanoma models, we found that aerobic exercise suppresses the growth of YUMMER 1.7 tumors but not B16F10 in mice. Consistent with this, single cell RNA sequencing revealed reductions in myeloid derived suppressor cells and a shift in T cell populations favoring a non-exhausted phenotype in YUMMER 1.7. Flow cytometry evaluation demonstrated significantly more CD8+ T cells in YUMMER 1.7, but not in B16F10, tumors from exercised mice. Interestingly, we found increased phosphorylation of ERK5 at the S496 residue when ECs were treated with serum from exercised mice <i>ex vivo<\/i>. We also found the crucial role of ERK5 S496 phosphorylation in promoting both inflammation and proliferation in ERK5 TEY motif phosphorylation (kinase activity) and transactivation-independent manner in both ECs and macrophages. We generated ERK5 S496A knock-in mice, and found that the ability of exercise to suppress YUMMER 1.7 tumor growth was completely lost in ERK5 S496A knock-in mice, suggesting that ERK5 S496 phosphorylation is a key in exercise-induced tumor growth suppression. We are currently evaluating immune cell infiltration into tumors with or without exercise in the ERK5 S496A knock-in model relative to wild type mice. Our data suggest that ERK5 S496 phosphorylation is a critical mediator of the tumor microenvironment. The often neglected role of ERK5 S496 signaling should be carefully considered in the interpretation of prior reports of ERK5 knockdown and pharmacological kinase inhibition relative to tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8735412b-47d1-4985-8588-05b24e7a1e00\/@s03B8ZLN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Physical activity,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11893"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hannah Savage<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sumedha Pareek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonghae Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riccardo Ballaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Venkatasubrahman Samanthapudi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyung Ae Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masaki Imanishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sivareddy Kotla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun-ichi Abe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keri Schadler<\/i><\/presenter>.

Generally speaking metastatic PDAC remains incurable. One reason behind PDAC morbidity and mortality is intratumor heterogeneity which allows metastatic dispersion and treatment resistance. We hypothesize that given multiple selective bottlenecks during metastatic progression, only a set of non-random gene programs are required for tumor cells to metastasize to different organs. To identify gene programs that become selected during PDAC metastatic progression we collected multiple (&#62;20) metastatic tissue samples from different local and distant organs, from two clinically non-redundant human rapid-autopsies as part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network. We generated single-nuclei RNA-seq and Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging data from these samples. Using trajectory analysis we inferred gene program dynamics between primary and metastatic samples and found an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-to-epithelial axis general to the metastases, suggesting that epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity is needed for cells to colonize other tissues. However, different organs have vastly different cell type compositions and may represent significantly different evolutionary bottlenecks. We employed archetype analysis as a tool to distinguish optimized phenotypes that may be shared or unique across colonized tissues. Archetype analysis revealed multiple gene programs, some of which are specific to a particular tissue and others ubiquitous. An epithelial-to-mesenchymal gene program was found to be shared across all samples at varying proportions, together with an extracellular matrix deposition\/interaction program. Other gene programs identified include angiogenesis, hypoxia, cell cycle, immune interaction, lipid metabolism, autophagy\/stress response, and cell migration. Some of these programs are present in various different metastases while others are unique to a specific site (e.g. Lipid metabolism in peritoneal metastasis). Together these programs shed light into organ tropism, metastatic modes of spread, adaptation to local tumor microenvironments, and cell-cell interactions with stromal cells. Further validation of these optimized phenotypes and integration of their spatial context will provide a deeper molecular understanding of metastatic PDAC and provide a source for data-driven therapeutic targets.<br \/>[A.
