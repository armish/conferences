We previously observed that STK11\/LKB1 mutations are genomic drivers of primary resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, LKB1-mutant NSCLCs exhibit higher hypoxia and glycolysis rates, resulting in enhanced production and secretion of lactate. Accordingly, we hypothesize that high production of lactate of LKB1 mutant tumor may contribute to its immunologically cold phenotype and that blockade of the lactate pathway may potentiate the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. We characterized the immune landscape of LKB1 mutant clinical samples and performed scRNAseq analysis in KRAS mutant (K) and KRAS mutant LKB1 knockout (KL) syngeneic murine models. To evaluate inhibition of lactate metabolism as a therapeutic strategy, we knocked out the lactate transporter <i>SLC16A3<\/i>\/MCT4 and characterized the impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME), and response to ICB. Clinical analysis of LKB1 mutant NSCLC patients from the MD Anderson&#8217;s ICON and PROSPECT cohorts suggested that LKB1 mutant tumors showed reduced immune cell infiltration, restricted T cell function, and enhanced M2-like macrophages phenotypes. Moreover, in preclinical models, LKB1 mutant tumors showed enhanced glycolysis and upregulation of MCT4 expression in a variety of human and murine cell lines. Deletion of MCT4 dramatically reduced glycolysis, energy production, and cell proliferation. By scRNAseq, we identified distinct immune subclusters modulated by LKB1 mutation. Hypofunctional T cells and M2-like macrophages were abundant in LKB1 mutant tumors, while these populations were significantly reduced in KL tumors with MCT4 KO. The conditioned medium from KL cells impaired T cell activation and decreased T cell killing, IFN&#947; production and glycolysis rate. Moreover, conditioned medium from KL cells induced M2-associated genes expression, as well as CD206+ expression in both peritoneal macrophages and Raw264.7 cells. These effects were at least in part MCT-dependent, as medium from MCT4 KO cells induced the opposite effects on T cells and macrophages, and the effects could be reversed by introducing exogenous lactate, suggesting that blockade of lactate transport reactivated T cells and reversed M2 polarization. Importantly, MCT4 KO in LKB1-mutant tumors sensitized tumors to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in syngeneic murine tumors and promoted long-term anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, our data indicate that LKB1 mutant tumors enhanced lactate secretion into the TME and this results in decreased T cell cytotoxic potential as well as higher pro-tumor M2 polarization, leading to resistance to immunotherapy. These data suggest that therapeutic inhibition of MCT4 is a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance in NSCLC patients harboring LKB1 mutant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LKB1,Macrophages,Lactate,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yu Qian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Guijarro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Galan-Cobo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minghao Dang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alissa Poteete<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fahao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edwin Parra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ferdinandos Skoulidis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignacio Wistuba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svena Verma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taha Merghoub<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linghua Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jedd Wolchok<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandre Reuben<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Heymach<\/i><\/presenter>.

Low-cost non-toxic approaches such as dietary modulations alter the responses of host and the cancer cells. Limited scientific investigations have examined the link between nutrition and EOC. Here, we tested the outcome of intermittent fasting (IF) on EOC progression with focus on fasting driven anti-tumor immune responses. Female C57\/B6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5x10<sup>6<\/sup> mouse epithelial ovarian cancer ID8 (p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup>, ID8 p53<sup>-\/-, PTEN-\/-<\/sup> and ID8 p53<sup>-\/-, BRCA-\/-<\/sup>) cells and fed either ad libitum (RD) or subjected to IF, where they underwent 16 hour fasting and 8 hour feeding window for 5 days\/ week. Tumor progression was monitored by ascites formation and abdominal circumference. Immune profiling was performed by flow cytometry using BD FACS Calibur. Untargeted metabolomics was performed in plasma from RD and IF mice using LC-MS\/MS. Enhancement of immunotherapy was tested by combining IF with anti-PD 1 (100 &#181;g\/mice, every 5<sup>th<\/sup> day, 3 times) in ID8 p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> tumor bearing mice and similar parameters were examined. IF reduced the growth of ID8 (p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup>, ID8 p53<sup>-\/-, PTEN-\/-<\/sup> and ID8 p53<sup>-\/-, BRCA-\/-<\/sup>) tumors, increased overall survival when compared to RD mice. IF promoted anti-tumor T cell response as seen by increase in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cells with enhanced expression of IFN&#947;, granzyme B and perforin compared to RD mice bearing ID8 cells in the ascites and blood. A striking observation was that the CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from IF mice exhibited a strong Th1 phenotype (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>IFN&#947;<sup>+<\/sup>), while Th2 phenotype (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>IL4<sup>+<\/sup>) was significantly decreased. IF when combined with anti-PD-1 treatment significantly improved survival and potentiated the T cell mediated anti-tumor response. Metabolic analysis revealed an enrichment in ketone body biosynthetic pathway as reflected by 5fold increase in serum ketone bodies such as beta hydroxy butyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate, when compared to RD. Receptors that have been reported to response to BHB as a ligand, specifically GPR109A and GPR41, were highly expressed on T cells derived from IF mice. BHB treatment enhanced the CD8+ T cell effector function as reflected by increased levels of IFN&#947;, granzyme B and perforin compared to untreated CD8+ T cells. Our study shows that IF significantly restricts EOC growth, improve survival, potentiate chemotherapy and immunotherapy anti-tumor response by augmenting T cell mediated anti-tumor immune responses. We also provide evidence that IF generated bioactive metabolite BHB which can be a potential substitute for availing the ant-tumor benefits of IF. Thus, our data provides strong evidence for IF and its metabolic mediator BHB for ameliorating EOC progression and as a viable approach in maintaining and sustaining an effective anti-tumor T cell response alone and in combination with immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Ovarian cancer,Overall survival,Cytotoxic T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mary Priyanka Udumula<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laila Poisson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Chun-Hui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nivedita Tiwari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harshit Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giri Shailendra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramandeep Rattan<\/i><\/presenter>.

We identified the pH sensing GPCR, GPR65, as a key determinant of low pH induced immune suppression in human cancers, particularly in TAMs, based on the following observations: 1) cancer patients who are homozygous for a hypomorphic coding variant in <i>GPR65<\/i> (I231L) show a statistically significant increase in survival and altered expression of key immune system genes compared to other genotypes; 2) single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from multiple solid tumors show that GPR65 and downstream pathway genes are ubiquitously expressed in myeloid and other innate immune cells in human cancers; and 3) low pH acting via GPR65 profoundly alters gene expression in human macrophages <i>in vitro<\/i>, bringing about a pronounced suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and a marked upregulation of tissue repair genes. These findings identify GPR65 as a novel innate immune check point, and suggest that GPR65 inhibition could be highly beneficial in cancer. Indeed, previous work has shown that genetic ablation of the GPR65 signaling pathway in B16.F10 tumour bearing mice upregulates immunostimulatory genes in TAMs and significantly reduces tumor growth<sup>1<\/sup>. Pathios has identified potent and selective antagonists of human GPR65 with excellent oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. In line with their potencies in recombinant cell systems, lead molecules are able to inhibit low pH induced cAMP elevations in primary human macrophages with IC50 values in the single digit nM range. In macrophages subjected to acidic conditions, the inhibitory effects on cAMP are accompanied by a reduction in the expression of anti inflammatory and tissue repair genes, and the enhancement of immunostimulatory genes. In particular, GPR65 inhibition counteracts the pronounced low pH induced suppression of key Type I\/II interferon (IFN) response genes and chemokines such as <i>CXCL9<\/i>, <i>CXCL10<\/i> and <i>CXCL11<\/i>. Following oral administration in tumour bearing mice, lead compounds up-regulate the expression of anti-tumor immune response genes at systemic exposures that significantly suppress GPR65 signalling <i>in vitro. <\/i>Results from tumour growth inhibition studies in mice with our GPR65 inhibitors will be also be presented. In summary, <i>&#8216;Macrophage Conditioning&#8217;<\/i> via GPR65 inhibition holds substantial promise as a novel immunoncology strategy to counteract the immunosuppressive effects of the acidic TME on TAMs, and could be deployed either as monotherapy or in combination with T cell checkpoint inhibitors or other standard of care treatments. <sup>1<\/sup>Nat.

The anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 immune-checkpoint inhibitors (Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab, Atezolizumab) have improved the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in 20-35% cases, but with a lower efficacy in females. The different steroid hormones - estrogens, progesterone or androgens - present in both gender have often contrasting effects on the activity of the host immune system, partly explaining the differences observed. It is not known if metabolic features of cancer cells of male and female patients may impact on the immune system response and immunotherapy efficacy. We set up an analytical pipeline based on patient-derived samples, cell lines and humanized male and female mice bearing gender-matched NSCLC xenografts. NanoString analysis in a cohort of 42 NSCLC patients of both genders treated with Pembrolizumab, identified the estrogen receptor &#945; (ER&#945;)\/<i>ESR1<\/i> gene as one of the most significantly associated with the response to Pembrolizumab, particularly in female patients. A panel of 30 human NSCLC cell lines of female and male origin, that reproduced the ER&#945;\/gender association observed in clinical samples, the amount of ER&#945; and 17-&#946;-estradiol was directly related to the expression of PD-L1, suggesting a potential direct linkage. ER&#945; transcriptionally up-regulated <i>CD274\/PD-L1 <\/i>gene, with higher effects in females. EGFR downstream effectors Akt and ERK1\/2, increased the active form phospho(Ser118)ER&#945;, upregulating PD-L1.<br \/>Inhibiting the estrogen synthesis or switching off EGFR activity down-regulated PD-L1 levels. Consistently, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole increased the efficacy of Pembrolizumab in humanized NSCLC xenografts, by reducing tumor growth and tumor-associated PD-L1, increasing the infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T-lymphocytes, NK cells and V&#947;9V&#948;2 anti-tumor T-lymphocytes. The benefit was maximal in <i><sup>17-&#946;-estradiol\/ER&#945; high <\/sup><\/i>female xenografts, intermediate in <i><sup>17-&#946;-estradiol\/ER&#945; medium <\/sup><\/i>female and male xenografts, minimal in <i><sup>17-&#946;-estradiol\/ER&#945; low <\/sup><\/i>male xenografts.<br \/>Additionally, an untargeted lipidome analysis revealed that letrozole decreased the saturated fatty acids (SFAs)\/mono- or poly-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs-PUFAs) ratio, and the cholesterol\/cholesterol esters ratio. These changes increased plasma-membrane fluidity, an event that in turns reduced the affinity between PD-L1 and PD-1. As further proof of concept, &#969;6- or &#969;3-PUFA treated cells, displayed an increased membrane fluidity and a change in lipid metabolism that affect the response to anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 as letrozole did.<br \/>We propose a prototypical <i>in vitro 3D spheroids culture <\/i>gender-tailored platform that allows to investigate the metabolic circuitries causing such differences and to repurpose metabolic modifiers as novel immune-adjuvant agents in oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Metabolomics,Estrogen metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sofia La Vecchia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dario Pasquale Anobile<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabrizio Tabbò<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris C.

Pancreatic cancer, in particular, is defined by dismal survival rates with many patients presenting with metastatic disease upon diagnosis and 5-year survival only reaching ~10%. Recent efforts to improve prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients involved immunotherapies alone and in combination with other therapeutics, however, progress remains limited. Despite CIN&#8217;s established role as a driver of disease progression, we have made the paradoxical observation that chromosomally unstable, murine pancreatic cancer cells elicit an anti-tumor immune response. CIN was induced in a chromosomally stable, metastatic model using piggyBac mutagenesis to increase chromosome segregation errors and simultaneously express the diphtheria toxin receptor, thymidine kinase, firefly luciferase and blue fluorescence protein transgenes. Modeling metastatic dissemination by injection of cells into the tail vein of mice led to robust tumor formation in the lungs where CIN<sup>low<\/sup> cells formed many small lesions while CIN<sup>high<\/sup> cells formed fewer but larger tumors. We investigated if the tumors were infiltrated differentially by immune cells by immunofluorescence and found that CIN<sup>high<\/sup> tumors were more readily infiltrated by effector T-cells. This observation motivated us to test immunotherapy response in CIN<sup>low<\/sup> and CIN<sup>high<\/sup> tumors. Subcutaneously implanted tumor cells were treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and isotype control antibody which revealed that CIN<sup>high<\/sup> cells responded to immunotherapy while CIN<sup>low<\/sup> cells did not. However, this response could easily be explained by the expression of ectopic antigens in CIN<sup>high<\/sup> cells as a result of the piggyBac mutagenesis, therefore, we derived isogenic single cell clones from the CIN<sup>high<\/sup> population and probed chromosome segregation fidelity and anti-tumor immunity in a more controlled system. Indeed, we were able to isolate CIN<sup>low<\/sup> and CIN<sup>high<\/sup> subclones and found that these displayed similar lung engraftment to original CIN<sup>low<\/sup> and CIN<sup>high<\/sup> cells as demonstrated by <i>in vivo<\/i> bioluminescence imaging. Importantly, this difference in engraftment efficiency was alleviated in immunocompromised mice supporting our notion that CIN mediates an anti-tumor immune response in this setting. In summary, our data implicates CIN as a determinant of therapeutic and genetic anti-tumor immunity in a preclinical model of pancreatic cancer. The utility of this model is illustrated by the isogenic nature of cells that only differ in CIN levels and their expression of <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> selection markers. Currently, we are determining the mechanistic underpinnings of our observation using a combination of transcriptomics and genetic manipulations by CRISPR\/Cas9.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Pancreatic cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Bronder<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roshan K.

We previously found an association of cancer cell autonomous loss of <i>CD58<\/i>, which encodes a co-stimulatory\/adhesion molecule, with immunotherapy resistance in patients. Here, we investigate the mechanistic molecular underpinnings of this observation. In patient-derived melanoma cells co-cultured with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), we found that CD58:CD2 ligation is specifically required for TIL-mediated killing and promotes T cell cytokine production. Furthermore, CD58 co-stimulation of TILs enhances their proliferation and activation compared to traditional methods of co-stimulation via CD28. We additionally examined the role of <i>CD58<\/i> <i>in vivo<\/i>. Given that there is no known mouse homolog for <i>CD58<\/i>, we utilized a humanized mouse model in which hIL-2-expressing NOD\/Shi-<i>scid<\/i>\/IL-2R&#947;<sup>null <\/sup>mice were implanted with patient-derived WT or <i>CD58<\/i> knockout (KO) melanoma cells, followed by adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of autologous TILs. We found that <i>CD58<\/i> KO tumors were resistant to ACT and had significantly lower TIL infiltration and proliferation compared to WT tumors, and that these effects were rescued by re-expressing <i>CD58<\/i>. We had previously found that <i>CD58<\/i> loss concurrently leads to higher expression of PD-L1, suggesting that enhanced co-inhibitory PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling could additionally contribute to cancer immune evasion. To understand CD58\/PD-L1 co-regulation, we first sought to delineate genetic and protein-protein regulation of CD58<i>.<\/i> We performed a genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9 KO screen with FACS enrichment, as well as unbiased CD58 co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry screens and identified <i>CMTM6<\/i> as a key regulator of CD58. Importantly, <i>CMTM6<\/i> was previously identified as a regulator of PD-L1 maintenance, positioning it as a potential candidate for regulating both co-stimulatory (CD58) and co-inhibitory (PD-L1) signals in cancer cells. Indeed, we find that both PD-L1 and CD58 are regulated by <i>CMTM6<\/i> at the level of lysosomal degradation. Furthermore, in cells with <i>CD58\/CMTM6<\/i> double-KO, <i>CMTM6<\/i> is required for CD58\/PD-L1 co-regulation, which is restored with re-expression of <i>CMTM6<\/i>. We therefore propose a model in which CD58 regulates PD-L1 by modulating its level of binding to CMTM6; in the absence of CD58, additional CMTM6 is available to bind PD-L1 and thereby stabilize its expression. In summary, we define a central role of the CD58:CD2 axis in tumor immunity and propose that loss of <i>CD58<\/i> confers cancer immune evasion through impaired T cell toxicity, tumor infiltration, and concurrent CMTM6-dependent PD-L1 upregulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patricia Ho<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johannes Melms<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meri Rogava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shivem Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Izar<\/i><\/presenter>.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the protein product of <i>PTGS2<\/i> and have been shown to enhance antitumor immunity. We hypothesized that NSAIDs induce ferroptosis and that this mechanism is essential for their effect on antitumor immunity. To test this, we first determined that ibuprofen and other NSAIDs induce cell death in YUMMER-1.7 melanoma and MC38 colorectal cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Cell death occurred progressively over 24 hours and could be blocked by multiple ferroptosis inhibitors. Treatment with NSAIDs also increased intracellular lipid peroxides and decreased levels of reduced glutathione and ferrous iron. This indicated that ibuprofen and other NSAIDs induce ferroptosis <i>in vitro<\/i>, so we next evaluated whether ibuprofen also induces ferroptosis <i>in vivo<\/i>. Analysis of ibuprofen-treated YUMMER-1.7 or MC38 tumors showed increased levels of lipid peroxides and lipid peroxide intermediates, 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde, compared to untreated tumors. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with ibuprofen alone resulted in approximately 60% tumor clearance and survival, whereas a combination of multiple ferroptosis inhibitors with ibuprofen completely abrogated this effect. Since it has been demonstrated by that CD8+ T cells can release IFN-&#947; to induce ferroptosis in tumor cells, we next tested the dependence of the antitumor effect of ibuprofen on CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and IFN-&#947; using depleting antibodies. Depletion of any of these was sufficient to prevent the antitumor effect of ibuprofen. Given the need to identify pathways that enhance responses to existing immunotherapies, we determined whether treatment with ibuprofen synergizes with PD-1 checkpoint blockade. The combination of &#945;-PD-1 with ibuprofen resulted in a 100% tumor clearance and survival rate, whereas &#945;-PD-1 or ibuprofen alone resulted in 40% and 60% tumor clearance and survival rates, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with ibuprofen also sensitized &#945;-PD-1-resistant tumors to PD-1 in two distinct models of &#945;-PD-1 resistance. Overall, these findings establish ibuprofen and other NSAIDs as inducers of ferroptosis and underscore the potential for ferroptosis inducers to be used in combination with existing immunotherapy regimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ronan Talty<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Ferreira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irina Krykbaeva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus Bosenberg<\/i><\/presenter>.
