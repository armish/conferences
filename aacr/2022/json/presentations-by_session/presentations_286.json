Our lab has shown that age-dependent changes in the tumor microenvironment drive this disparity. In particular, loss of a secreted extracellular matrix protein, HAPLN1, in the aged dermis confers increased metastasis via matrix breakdown and resulting cellular dysfunction. In this study we found that HAPLN1-mediated matrix changes impede the barrier function of blood vessels and upregulate vascular ligands which in turn increase the propensity for melanoma intravasation and metastasis via this route. VE-cadherin is a key endothelial cell junctional protein whose expression is directly correlated with vascular integrity. We showed via IHC that intradermal treatment of aged mice with recombinant HAPLN1 (rHAPLN1) is sufficient to significantly increase VE-cadherin levels in intratumoral blood vessels compared to untreated aged mice, equal to levels seen in young mice. Further, we isolated the contribution of the matrix by producing <i>in vitro<\/i> fibroblast derived matrices (FDMs) from the dermal fibroblasts of healthy young and aged donors. An impedance-based assay showed that resistance of human endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers is significantly decreased when cultured on aged matrix compared to young or aged+rHAPLN1 matrices. We found via qRT-PCR screen that HUVECs cultured on HAPLN1-low FDMs (aged, young+shHAPLN1) have upregulated ICAM1 compared those in HAPLN1-high environments (young, aged+rHAPLN1). ICAM1 is an endothelial cell receptor whose upregulation initiates a signaling cascade to downregulate VE-cadherin and increase vascular permeability. We confirmed the HAPLN1-dependent expression of ICAM1 <i>in vivo<\/i> via IHC of murine tumors. ICAM1 expression is known to be modulated in response to ECM stiffness. We have shown that matrices formed by aged fibroblasts are stiffer than those formed by young, and that this is due in part to the absence of HAPLN1. We created artificially stiffened FDMs via chemical cross-linking of otherwise pliable young FDMs to determine if stiffness alone was sufficient to upregulate ICAM1 on endothelial cells. We found via qRT-PCR that artificially stiffened young matrices were sufficient to increase endothelial ICAM1 levels on par with those in aged and young+shHAPLN1 conditions. This is critical, as endothelial ICAM1 is upregulated in melanoma and other cancers and is used as a ligand for cancer cells to move through the vasculature. In sum, we have found that age-dependent loss of HAPLN1 in the dermal ECM confers increased matrix stiffness which leads to the upregulation of endothelial ICAM1. This in turn increases vascular permeability to allow melanoma cells to more easily intravasate and metastasize via the hematogenous pathway in the aged system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Metastasis,Vascular permeability,Adhesion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gloria E.

However, the ways in which aging alters cell populations that comprise the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME) and impacts tumor growth are incompletely understood. PDAC tumors are highly desmoplastic, and fibroblasts are a key component of the TME that are known to alter the behavior of cancer cells and impact treatment responses. Here, we report that normal pancreatic fibroblasts acquire tumor-promoting properties during aging and alter the properties of PDAC cells both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>To determine if PDAC tumors may be influenced by an aged microenvironment, we performed orthotopic KPC cell injections into the pancreata of aged (&#62;64-week-old) and young (6-8-week-old) syngeneic C57Bl\/6J mice. Aged mice have significantly larger tumors, increased incidence of metastases, and decreased survival compared to young mice. Tumors from aged mice also have increased neovascularization as evidenced by increased CD31 and CD105 expression. We next queried whether aged pancreatic fibroblasts may contribute to this increase in tumor growth. We have generated a panel of aged (donors &#62;55 years old) and young (donors &#60;35 years old) normal human pancreatic fibroblasts to determine the effects of healthy aging fibroblasts on PDAC cell behavior. Conditioned media from aged human pancreatic fibroblasts significantly increases the proliferation of PDAC cells suggesting that secreted factors produced by aged fibroblasts enhance cancer cell growth. We confirmed this finding using the KPC mouse cell line and conditioned media from aged (&#62;68-week-old) or young (6-8-week-old) normal mouse pancreatic fibroblasts, providing evidence that aged fibroblasts may contribute to the increased tumor growth observed in our <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments. In addition, aged fibroblast conditioned media increases the migratory potential of PDAC cells <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/>Next, we evaluated changes in the invasiveness of PDAC cells in a 3D co-culture system with either aged or young pancreatic fibroblasts. PDAC spheroids containing cancer cells and aged fibroblasts exhibit a significant increase in invasiveness compared to those containing young fibroblasts.<br \/>In conclusion, we show that aged, non-cancer-associated pancreatic fibroblasts have the potential to promote growth, migration, and invasiveness in multiple models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.<br \/>We hypothesize that factors secreted by pancreatic fibroblast change during aging and that this aged secretome is tumor-promoting. We will present these and ongoing studies examining age-related changes in pancreatic fibroblasts in the context of PDAC tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Aging,Fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel J.

Investigation into how age impacts breast cancer development suggests that both the accumulation of oncogenic mutations within incipient tumor cells and age-related stromal changes conspire to drive tumorigenesis. While numerous physiologic changes arise with age, we posit that the accumulation of p16<sup>INKA4<\/sup> (p16) positive<sup> <\/sup>senescent cells, which express various cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes collectively referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) contribute to cancer progression. SASP factors not only directly promote the proliferation of tumor cells, but also create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that contributes to robust tumor growth. Immunosuppressive SASP factors are detectable in human breast cancer stroma and high p16 positivity in stromal cells strongly correlates with breast cancer recurrence regardless of subtype. To investigate the role of senescent stroma in mammary tumor development, we crossed MMTV-PyMT (PyMT) transgenic mice that spontaneously develop mammary tumors to INK-ATTAC (INK) mice, which allows selective elimination of p16-positive cells. Depletion of senescent stromal cells in PyMT\/INK mice led to significantly delayed mammary tumor onset and changes in various tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations. Analyses of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets of murine and human mammary tumor\/breast cancer samples revealed that senescence is restricted to a cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) subpopulation, which expresses high levels of immune-related and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related SASP factors and shows decreasing abundance in PyMT\/INK mice upon the depletion of senescent stroma. Together, these data suggest that senescent CAFs contribute to mammary gland tumorigenesis by modulating tumor immunity and remodeling ECM in the microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Senescence,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiayu (Jennifer) Ye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Paula Delgado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Powers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheila Stewart<\/i><\/presenter>.

A key hallmark of skin ageing is the loss of subcutaneous fat. Because previous work has established that lipids contribute to melanoma invasion and proliferation, we studied whether aged adipocytes contribute to the poor outcome of aged patients. We compared the distinct lipid secretory profile of young and aged human subcutaneous adipocytes, and discovered young and aged adipocytes contribute different lipids to the melanoma microenvironment, activating aged-dependent signaling pathways and driving distinct metabolic programms in melanoma cells.<br \/>To test how aged and young adipocytes affect melanoma, we obtained human preadipocytes from donors of different ages and differentiated them to functional adipocytes in vitro. We studied the morphological, transcriptomic, proteomic, and lipid profile of adipocytes by age, then exposed melanoma cells to the young or aged adipocyte secretome. We observed melanoma cells exposed to young adipocyte secretome increased the rate of proliferation, invasion, and migration compared to melanoma cells exposed to aged adipocyte secretomes. This effect was linked to a greater amount of total lipids secreted by young adipocytes, as well as a unique ratio of lipids by age, which were taken up by melanoma cells. Critically, lipid transfer led to distinct signaling pathway activation and metabolic reprogramming. <i>In vivo<\/i>, these differences led to a greater rate of metastasis and distinct tropism of melanoma cells exposed to aged or young adipocyte secretomes.

Despite this, age is understudied in the OvCa field. Using a C57Bl\/6 mouse model of aging, young (Y) mice ranging from 3-6 months of age and aged (A) mice ranging from 20-23 months of age were used to study the role aging has on metastasis. Fluorescently tagged C57Bl\/6 syngeneic ID8<i>trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mouse ovarian surface epithelial cancer cells were injected intraperitoneally in Y and A mice and disease progression was evaluated following 5.5 weeks. Organ-specific tumor burden was quantified with ImageJ, revealing increased tumor burden in A mice compared to their Y counterparts. These results were reproduced in the FVB mouse model using syngeneic PTEN<sup>shRNA<\/sup>\/KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> oviductal epithelial cells. While <i>in vitro<\/i> assays showed no significant difference in adhesion or invasion of OvCa cells on Y vs A collagen, human cell lines showed increased invasion through Boyden invasion chambers lined with A collagen compared to Y. The relationship between tumors and aged collagen was further investigated by analysis of collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP) staining of paraffin-embedded omental tumor sections, which shows an increase of intratumoral collagen remodeling in A tumors despite no significant difference in overall collagen amount as shown by trichrome analysis of serial sections. However, second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG) and CHP fluorescence analysis of early tumor events shows increased peritumoral collagen remodeling in Y mice, showing a difference between intratumoral collagen and microenvironmental collagen. Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded tumor sections showed similar amounts of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in Y and A tumors, suggesting intratumoral collagen is newly synthesized by CAFs whereas the collagen in the microenvironment is truly aged. To further investigate peritumoral collagen in the metastatic microenvironment, SHG was used to visualize collagen of common metastatic sites from Y and A tumor na&#239;ve C57Bl\/6 mice. Distinct structural differences were shown in omental collagen in the Y vs A cohorts and validated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

We queried whether the lung microenvironment undergoes age-related changes that provide a permissive niche for metastatic outgrowth. Our data showed that secreted factors by lung fibroblasts changed during aging that promoted proliferation of melanoma cells via expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor MER. Further investigation of this MER-high phenotype revealed that these melanoma cells induce dramatic changes to the lung microenvironment via secretion of its primary ligand PROS1, which creates a more permissive niche for metastasis. It first acts in a paracrine manner to induce proliferation of previously dormant melanoma cells in the lung. MER induced secretion of PROS1 by melanoma cells also regulates the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) from lung fibroblasts. Specifically, healthy human lung fibroblasts produce thick, unified cellular derived matrices (CDMs) <i>in vitro<\/i> that are growth-restrictive to melanoma cells. Treatment of lung fibroblasts with conditioned media from MER-High melanoma cells or with recombinant-PROS1 alters CDM density and orientation, which resulted in a CDM that dramatically increased melanoma proliferation. Finally, we found that MER induced metastatic outgrowth of melanoma cells within the lungs of mice decreased CD4 and CD8 T-cells whilst increasing infiltration of and immunosuppressive T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs).<br \/>Overall, we find that age-induced activation of melanoma cells towards a MER-high state within the lung can induce a cancer phenotype which dramatically alters fibroblast ECM production and immune cell infiltration to promote aggressive and efficient metastatic outgrowth and a growth permissive microenvironment for dormant melanoma cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Metastasis,Dormancy,Stroma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mitchell Fane<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashani Weeraratna<\/i><\/presenter>.

Bone metastases derive from early disseminated tumor cells that become dormant because of interaction with specific cells that define the endosteal niche (EN) microenvironment. However, outside knowing that dormancy is driven by a p38MAPK<sup>hi<\/sup>, ERK1\/2<sup>lo<\/sup> activation profile, our understanding of what factors regulate dormancy maintenance and reawakening is poor. We used a genomic shRNA screen to identify HBP1 as a suppressor of BrCa dormancy reawakening in a 3D-EN culture system. Our data indicate that under 3D-EN conditions, HBP1 is upregulated by p38MAPK, interacts with the metastasis suppressors, BRMS1 and BRMS1L, and with the histone modifiers, SIN3A and HDAC1-3. We hypothesize that HBP1 suppresses p38MAPK-mediated dormancy reawakening by complexing with BRMS1\/ BRMS1L\/SIN3A to alter cell cycle gene expression through histone landscape remodeling. HBP1 suppresses the expression of cell cycle progression genes, such as MYC and CCND1, and concomitantly upregulates cyclin kinase inhibitors, p16 and p21. HBP1 RNA and protein levels are decreased in BrCa metastases relative to primary tumors, and this downregulation correlates with poorer overall survival. We are investigating whether the anti-histiminic drug, cyproheptadine, which upregulates HBP1 expression through the activation of p38MAPK, can suppress dormancy reawakening of BrCa cells in 3D-EN cultures and in in vivo models of bone dormancy using mouse mammary carcinoma D2A1 cell lines with varying abilities to form active or dormant metastatic bone colonization. Data will be shown addressing how cell-cell interactions and secretory factors between BrCa and bone EN cells facilitates dormancy signaling through a p38MAPK\/HBP1\/BRMS1 axis, and how drugs such as cyproheptadine agonize that pathway in order to prevent the reawakening that drives the growth of BrCa metastases in the bone, thereby increasing overall survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p38 MAP kinases,Bone metastasis,Tumor microenvironment,Chromatin remodeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Irwin H.
