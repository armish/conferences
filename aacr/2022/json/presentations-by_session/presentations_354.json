[{"Abstract":"Methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) is a mitochondrial bifunctional enzyme with dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activity. MTHFD2 is expressed in embryonic tissues and not in adult tissues, and by generating formate for purine biosynthesis, enhances proliferation. It is over expressed in many cancers, including breast cancer, and has become an important cancer drug target. Knockdown (KD) of MTHFD2 in breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D, slowed proliferation and resulted in an increase in early apoptosis and a S-phase block. Lack of MTHFD2 causes a dependence on glycine, and in the absence of glycine, proliferation of the MCF-7 cell line with MTHFD2 knocked down was inhibited even further. A known specific glycine transporter type-I (GlyT1) inhibitor, ORG 25935 potently inhibited growth of MCF7 cell with MTHFD2 KD, while it had less of an effect on T47D cells with MTHFD2 KD. Furthermore, both cell lines with MTHFD2 KD showed increase in expression of GlyT1 (SLC6A9) at both mRNA and protein level, using the qPCR and western blotting, respectively. The metabolomics studies showed that intracellular glycine, and NAD<sup>+<\/sup> pools are more reduced in control cells compared to MTHFD2 KD cells on treatment with GlyT1 inhibitor, suggesting that this inhibitor causes glycine depletion in the cells. These data encourage the development of inhibitors of MTHFD2 for use in combination with glycine transport inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f49bebb1-1daa-4ac9-a0fd-305b91975e20\/@y03B8ZE5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination studies,Breast cancer,MTHFD2,Glycine Uptake Inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12270"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gulam Mohmad Rather<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph R.

Inhibition of HPK1 is an attractive therapeutic strategy for immuno-oncology based treatment of solid tumors<sup>3<\/sup>. We present in vitro, in vivo, pharmacokinetic (PK) and early safety profiles of a novel and differentiated HPK1 inhibitor GRC 54276.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> GRC 54276 is our clinical candidate, designed and developed using intuitive medicinal chemistry design and supported by computational approaches. SAR studies included a battery of biochemical assays, functional read-outs and primary human in vitro T-cell activation assays. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in syngeneic mouse tumor models, both as a single agent and combination with immune check-point blockers (ICB), mouse anti-CTLA4 antibody or Atezolizumab (human anti-PD-L1 antibody). ADME-PK properties was evaluated cross-species. GLP and non-GLP safety tolerability studies were conducted in mice and monkeys.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> GRC 54276 demonstrated sub-nanomolar HPK1 potency, strong target engagement of pSLP76 inhibition, anti-tumor cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-&#947;) induction, reversal of immunosuppression by prostaglandin E<sub>2<\/sub> (PGE2) or adenosine in both human and mouse systems. GRC 54276 demonstrated very strong tumor growth inhibition (TGI) efficacy as single agent and significantly enhanced TGI in combination with ICB antibodies anti-CTLA4 (CT26 model) or Atezolizumab (MC38-hPD-L1 model). The in vivo TGI efficacy mechanistically correlated with increased immune responses of cytokine induction, infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, tumor rejections accompanied by immune memory T cells induction. Pharmacokinetic profile of GRC 54276 included cross-species oral bioavailability (30 to 100%), predominant clearance by CYP3A4 with no significant inhibition of major CYP isoforms, negative activation potency in human PXR assay at several-fold over ED<sub>max<\/sub> exposures. Safety profile demonstrated that GRC 54276 is non-genotoxic in the bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice and has no hERG liability.

Misregulations of this pathway contribute to different pathologies such as cancer, fibrosis, nash or inflammatory diseases. SMAD4 genetic alterations, either via genomic loss or via mutations, can be found in many cancer types. SMAD4 is mutated or deleted in 10-15% of colorectal cancers and in 20-50% of pancreatic cancer. The poorer prognosis of colorectal cancers and pancreatic cancers patients harboring SMAD4 alterations makes SMAD4 deficiency interesting to harness for therapy. Anticancer opportunity created by loss of SMAD4 function\/protein could be addressed by identifying synthetic lethal genes that encode for druggable proteins. CRISPR\/CAS9 is a revolutionary discovery to produce gene knockout. CRISPR\/CAS9 viability screen is a tool of choice to pinpoint new synthetic lethality interactions. In this work, to extend the genetic vulnerabilities of SMAD4-deficient tumors, we conducted a pooled genome-wide loss of function CRISPR\/Cas9 screen in sets of 4 non-isogenic colorectal and pancreatic cancers cancer cell lines harboring wild-type and mutant SMAD4. We identified known and novel genetic alterations that make SMAD4-altered colorectal cancers &#38; pancreatic cancers cells vulnerable. We will present the validation of the Ras-related protein Rab-10 (RAB10) as synthetic lethal gene with SMAD4 alteration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5530fce-5b7b-4f0c-a93f-b87ed470223c\/@y03B8ZE5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Target discovery,CRISPR\/CAS9 Screening,RAB10,SMAD4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12277"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christophe Marcireau<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hélène Erasimus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanessa Kolnik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederic Lacroix<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephane D’agostino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Lemaitre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandre Rohaut<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle Sanchez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sukhvinder Sidhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gilbert Thill<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurent Debussche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michel Didier<\/i><\/presenter>.

Metabolic gene MTAP is localized at the 9p21 chromosome in the close proximity to CDKN2A tumor-suppressor locus. Co-deletion of MTAP may be observed in 80-90% of all tumors harboring homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, which represents 10-15% of all human tumors. MTAP deletion results in a massive accumulation of methylotioadenosine (MTA) in cells. MTA in high concentrations is a selective inhibitor of PRMT5 type II methyltransferase. PRMT5 conjugated with WD-repeat containing protein (WDR77) builds methylosome, which regulates essential cellular functions via symmetric demethylation (SDMA) of target proteins involved in regulation of gene expression, RNA splicing, signal transduction, metabolism and other functions. Accumulation of MTA in cells with MTAP deletion causes a partial inhibition of the methylation activity of PRMT5, which in turn reduces the level of symmetric arginine dimethylation of the whole proteome, and thus an increased sensitivity of cells to modulation of the methylosome activity. Therapeutic targeting of PRMT5 in homozygous MTAP-deleted cancers constitute a promising strategy of selective killing of genetically defined cancer cells. Currently available clinical stage PRMT5 small molecule inhibitors are not MTA-cooperative and therefore are not selective in tumors harboring MTAP deletion. Here we present MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, which selectively inhibit the growth of MTAP deleted cancer cells. Ryvu has identified a series of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors which have good drug-like physicochemical properties and block methyltransferase activity with nanomolar IC50 values. Ryvu compounds selectively inhibit growth of MTAP deleted cancer cells in prolonged 3D culture, which strongly correlates with inhibition of PRMT5-dependent protein symmetric demethylation (SDMA) in those cells. Selectivity between effects observed in MTAP deleted and WT cells exceeds 100-fold both for SDMA and growth inhibition. The DMPK profile of these compounds allows for oral administration, which enables testing dose-dependent antitumor activity in MTAP null tumor xenograft-bearing mice. Overall,&#8239;these studies provide rationale for further optimization of chemical series towards clinical candidate.&#8239;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b24a32b0-ce38-4ab5-b103-712443365ce9\/@y03B8ZE5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,MTAP deletion,PRMT5,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12276"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"ba5f01d7-5edf-4ec8-9c22-85b45cf61cb0","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ba5f01d7-5edf-4ec8-9c22-85b45cf61cb0\/@y03B8ZE5\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Oleksandr Levenets<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Bartosik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta Sowi&#324;ska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karol Zuchowicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sujit Sasmal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Klara Korta-Pi&#261;tek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Radzimierski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paulina Niedziejko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oleksandr Popika<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mateusz &#346;wirski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agata Stachowicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maciej Mikulski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Magdalena Sieprawska-Lupa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katarzyna Banaszak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kinga Michalik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kamil Ku&#347;<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Monika Madej<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrian Podkowa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karolina Gluza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grzegorz Sata&#322;a<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ewelina Cieluch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dobros&#322;awa Krzemie&#324;<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrzej Gondela<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grzegorz &#262;wiertnia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marek Wronowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Boutard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Wi&#281;ckowska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanna Zezula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justyna Jab&#322;o&#324;ska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miros&#322;awa G&#322;adysz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Tomczyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacek Faber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcin Serocki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eliza Drwal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kamila Koz&#322;owska-Tomczyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta Skoda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Swarbrick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krzysztof Brzózka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mateusz Nowak<\/i><\/presenter>.

Deletion of MTAP, an enzyme in methionine and adenine salvage pathways, results in accumulation of its substrate MTA, which is structurally similar to SAM, the substrate methyl donor for the type II methyltransferase PRMT5. In <i>MTAP<\/i> deleted cells, MTA competes with SAM for binding to PRMT5, placing PRMT5 in a partially inhibited or hypormorphic state. Multiple studies using shRNAi knockdown have shown that tumor cell lines harboring <i>MTAP<\/i> deletions are vulnerable to PRMT5 inhibition. PRMT5 inhibitors that have advanced to clinical studies do not selectively target the MTA-bound form of PRMT5, and the preclinical activity of these molecules is not enriched in MTAP-deleted tumor cells lines. Moreover, the therapeutic window of these molecules is narrow, presumably due to the inhibition of PRMT5 in normal cells. We set out to identify PRMT5 inhibitors that bind cooperatively with MTA, with the goal of selectively targeting PRMT5 in <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted tumors. A DNA encoded library screen was conducted to identify small molecules that preferentially bind to PRMT5 in the presence of MTA. The subsequent optimization of screening hits to improve potency, MTA-cooperativity, and pharmacokinetic properties led to the identification of AM-9747. The nature of the MTA cooperativity of AM-9747 was interrogated by multiple biophysical methods and structural biology experiments. Following treatment with AM-9747, the levels of SDMA marks were lower in HCT116 <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted cells (IC50 = 0.0002 &#956;M) compared to HCT116 <i>MTAP<\/i>-WT cells (IC50 = 0.050 &#956;M). AM-9747 selectively inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted cells (IC50 = 0.027 &#956;M) compared to HCT116 <i>MTAP<\/i>-WT cells (IC50 = 0.63 &#956;M). The profiling of AM-9747 in an expanded panel of tumor cell lines demonstrated that AM-9747 inhibited the proliferation of most<i> MTAP<\/i>-deleted cells, with minimal effects on <i>MTAP<\/i>-WT cells. <i>In vitro<\/i> mechanism of action studies demonstrated that treatment with AM-9747 induces DNA damage, as illustrated by increased phosphorylation of H2AX, and an arrest in the G2\/M phase of the cell cycle in <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted cells. <i>In vivo<\/i>, oral administration of AM-9747 selectively inhibits SDMA and tumor growth in HCT116 <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted tumor xenografts, compared to HCT116 <i>MTAP<\/i>-WT xenografts. Furthermore, treatment with AM-9747 inhibits the growth of multiple <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted tumor xenograft models, including BXPC3 (PDAC) and DOHH2 (DLBCL). AM-9747 was profiled against a panel of over twenty PDX models, with greater than 50% tumor growth inhibition observed in the majority of PDX models harboring deletion of the <i>MTAP<\/i> gene. Our data with AM-9747 indicates that PRMT5 inhibitors that selectively target PRMT5 in cooperation with MTA may represent a novel and compelling therapeutic strategy for the treatment of <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fae2eedc-23e3-491b-b50b-1367896c65fc\/@y03B8ZE5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,PRMT5,Epigenetics,Novel Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12274"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian Belmontes<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonia Policheni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siyuan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Slemmons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jodi Moriguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hayley Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Aiello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yajing Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikkel Vestergaard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanne Cowland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Sarvary<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nuria Tamayo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liping Pettus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susmith Mukund<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leszek Pope<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer R.

Despite the large number of preclinical studies investigating engineered MSCs as therapeutic agents and numerous clinical trials investigating MSCs for other therapeutic applications, there have only been a handful of clinical trials investigating MSCs for treating solid tumors, and none have progressed beyond Phase I\/II. Inefficient tumor homing ability and a lack of understanding of fundamental mechanisms may contribute to the limited translational success of MSC-based therapies. We hypothesized that nanoengineering MSCs with anticancer drugs induces oxidative stress, and MSCs counteract this stress by activating Nrf2, which increases the expression of various antioxidant proteins, including CXCR4, a key mediator of MSC tumor homing. We performed global label-free, unbiased proteomics on nanoengineered MSCs using modified in-Stage technology. Our studies indicated that MSCs nanoengineered with paclitaxel underwent significant changes in the overall proteome compared to either untreated MSCs or MSCs loaded with blank nanoparticles. Analysis of molecular function profile revealed that loading paclitaxel in MSCs significantly enhanced the expression of proteins involved in the antioxidant and catalytic activity and protein binding. The biological process profile also showed a similar increase in defense response and an increase in metabolic processes. It was further found that MSCs nanoengineered with PTX lead to significant upregulation of nrf2, the master regulator of antioxidant responses, and CXCR4, a direct target of Nrf2 and a key mediator of tumor homing. Also, an increase in CXCR4 expression was directly proportional to paclitaxel loading in cells. These studies suggest nanoengineering of MSCs impacts their biology, which likely contributes to their improved tumor homing capacity in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9c2cbd45-233f-4449-a491-1b295d9eb1a3\/@y03B8ZE5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal stem cell,Drug delivery,Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12275"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Drishti Sehgal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susheel Kumar Nethi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Merali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Salim Merali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayanth Panyam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swayam Prabha<\/i><\/presenter>.

We hypothesize that c-MYC destabilizing constructs will degrade c-MYC transcript and proteins across a range of cancers that overexpress this oncogene. We used heterogeneous panels of TNBC, prostate cancer, and osteosarcoma cell lines that are reflective of the heterogeneity of human cancers. We introduced our c-MYC destabilizing construct and assessed cell viability. We then performed immunofluorescence and western blot for assessment of c-MYC protein expression. Vector constructs were used as controls. Introduction of destabilizing elements achieved the degradation of both c-MYC transcript and proteins within four days, as well as a subsequent loss in cell viability.

Despite intensive multimodality therapy, outcomes remain dismal for a subset of patients with aggressive or high-risk molecular features. Characteristic of most pediatric cancers, MRT and WT demonstrate relatively low frequencies of somatic mutations compared to adult tumors and generally lack therapeutically targetable genetic alterations. Hence, we applied a systems biology approach to identify and evaluate non-genetically encoded vulnerabilities in MRT and WT.<br \/>Methods: MetaVIPER analysis was performed to computationally infer protein activity from MRT and WT whole transcriptomic data available in the TARGET database. Expanded metaVIPER analysis of TARGET and TCGA cohorts demonstrated XPO1 as having consistently high inferred activity in MRT and WT. Functional <i>in vitro<\/i> studies using a selective inhibitor of XPO1, selinexor, were performed on a panel of MRT and WT cell lines to evaluate the effects of XPO1 inhibition on proliferation, cell cycle transition and apoptosis induction. <i>In vivo<\/i> validation of anti-tumor activity following XPO1 inhibition were performed in cell line-derived (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of MRT and WT.<br \/>Results: MetaVIPER analysis identified consistent high inferred activity of XPO1 in MRT and WT compared to other tumor types. MRT and WT cell lines demonstrated <i>in vitro <\/i>sensitivity to selinexor treatment resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. Furthermore, protein expression analysis showed increased nuclear sequestration of tumor suppressors proteins following treatment with selinexor. <i>In vivo<\/i> treatment of panel of MRT and WT CDX and PDX models with selinexor and a next-generation XPO1 inhibitor, eltanexor, resulted in significant abrogation of tumor growth with associated decreases in inferred XPO1 activity. Pharmacodynamic analysis of treated PDX tumors show decreased levels of XPO1, RB1-pSer780, and increased p53, p27 and p21 protein levels. Based on promising preclinical data, we describe a case report of a child with relapsed and progressive Wilms tumor who experienced a sustained complete remission on maintenance selinexor therapy.<br \/>Conclusion: XPO1 represents a non-genetically encoded vulnerability in MRT and WT. Promising preclinical activity in MRT and WT models has provided the preclinical rationale for evaluation of XPO1 inhibition in an investigator-initiated clinical trial of Selinexor in pediatric MRT and WT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cef4c582-d62c-4313-aa4f-b1744a5699d5\/@z03B8ZE6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wilms' tumor,Malignant rhabdoid tumor,XPO1 inhibitor,patient-derived xenograft ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12279"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Diego F.

It is hypovascularized, hypoxic, and poor in nutrients. These features, which are critical due to the increased energetic demand in continuously replicating cancer cells, drive metabolic reprograming to support the continued activity. Thus leading to a vulnerability in the form of energy restriction - a vulnerability further exacerbated by the nutrient-poor pancreatic cancer TME. We have recently shown mitochondrial inhibition to have great potential in in-vitro inhibition of PDAC cells. Since repurposing of FDA-approved drugs holds great promise in terms of faster and safer drug development, we selected to investigate the effect of mitochondrial inhibition on pancreatic cancer cells through assessment of the previously FDA-approved antimicrobial Dithiazanine Iodide (CDI). CDI is a fluorescent, orally bioavailable, small molecule. <i>In-vitro<\/i>, it has been previously shown to preferentially localize to the mitochondria, bind proteins and nucleic acids, and have a yet to be discerned inhibitory effect on the electron transport chain. We demonstrated CDI had low IC50s (30-300 nM) in multiple PDAC and other GI cancer cell lines. In an agnostic, unbiased manner, we assessed metabolomic and transcriptomic perturbations caused by CDI. These revealed a profound 92% decrease in the abundance of mitochondrial-encoded transcripts (P&#60;0.05), decreased mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and a reduction in the ATP\/ADP ratio. We have therefore hypothesized that the anti-cancer effects of CDI may be related to disruption of mitochondrial processes and we proceeded to characterize its mechanism of action. CDI treatment reduced protein expression of electron transport chain complexes I, II, III, and IV. Treatment with CDI in hypoglycemic conditions resulted in a 3-4 fold increase in sensitivity (P&#60;0.05) and ATP quantification showed a marked &#62;90% decrease in cellular ATP (P&#60;0.05). Furthermore, mitochondria-depleted PDAC cell lines were 4-fold more resistant to CDI treatment (P&#60;0.05). In-vivo, oral CDI treatment resulted in a 2-fold decrease in mouse xenograft tumor growth compared to gemcitabine treatment. RNA-sequencing from the <i>in-vivo<\/i> samples showed a 60% reduction in the abundance of mitochondrial-encoded transcripts (P&#60;0.05). Examination of the mitochondrial sequences revealed the existence of putative G-Quadruplex sequences. Fluorescence shift and stop-PCR assays confirmed CDI to be a G-Quadruplex binder of mitochondrial sequences.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d699972-4dd9-40c2-93fb-cb80088748fd\/@z03B8ZE6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Mitochondria,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12278"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Avinoam Nevler<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher W.

They are often highly aggressive neoplasms that rapidly progress and eventually recur and give distant metastases. They are largely considered to be resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Recurrent somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase I (<i>IDH1)<\/i> genes have been identified in a spectrum of human malignancies, including chondrosarcoma. Mutations in these genes lead to impaired ability of IDH1 to catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to alpha ketoglutarate and to gain of a neomorphic enzymatic activity which results in production of oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Our preliminary data indicated that compared to samples that were wild type, IDH1 mutant samples showed a significant increase in intra-tumoral 2HG levels. In the present study, we hypothesized that 2-HG accumulation induces DNA and histone hypermethylation and altered gene expression, ultimately resulting in a block in cellular differentiation by competitively inhibiting &#945;-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases involved in histone and DNA demethylation. Therefore, we proposed that inhibition of IDH should mediate its antitumor effects through the induction of differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we utilized human chondrosarcoma cell lines including IDH wild type (CH2879) and IDH1 mutant (JJ012) and the IDH1 inhibitor FT6535. Results from our <i>in vitro<\/i> cell viability assay and histone methylation showed that selective inhibition of IDH1 resulted in modest inhibition of cell proliferation and suppression of histone methylation in IDH1 mutant chondrosarcoma cells. Next we elected to test the IDH inhibitor in combination with differentiating agents including retinoic acid. Cell viability assays showed that when compared to either agent alone, the combination of retinoic acid and FT6535 resulted in a significant decrease in cellular proliferation. Western blot analysis showed induction of COL1A2 and SOX9 <i>(differentiation markers)<\/i> with suppression of histone methylation H3K27me3 or H3K9me3, Taken together, our data strongly suggests that combination treatment with the IDH1 inhibitor FT6535 and retinoic acid represents a novel approach to suppress cell growth by epigenetic modulation to induce differentiation and merits further evaluation as a potential treatment modality in chondrosarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f557ec23-338e-4ee4-ad41-8371f3700694\/@z03B8ZE6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Differentiation,Combination therapy,IDH1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12282"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tahir N.

The microtubule associated motor protein KIF20A (also called MKlp2), a member of the kinesin-6 family, plays an essential role during cytokinesis and is also involved in the fission of RAB6-positive vesicles from Golgi membrane, therefore contributing to intracellular vesicular trafficking (1). KIF20A plays a critical role in the development and progression of many cancers, and its high expression is associated with disease progression and poor survival outcome (2). More specifically, immature hematopoietic cells, exhibit high KIF20A expression, whereas mature peripheral blood cells do not<sup> <\/sup>(3). Herein we describe the preclinical anti-leukemic efficacy of DIACC2010, sole-in-class selective KIF20A inhibitor. DIACC2010 demonstrated potent and consistent cytotoxic activity <i>in-vitro<\/i> against a panel of 9 human AML cell lines, with median IC50 of 40 nM (range 10-77 nM). In the same experimental conditions, cytarabine (CYTA) had median IC50 of 207 nM (range 4-1580 nM). In parallel, no <i>in-vitro<\/i> toxicity of DIACC2010 was observed on human normal cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and primary hepatocytes (IC50 &#62;50 &#181;M). DIACC2010 was subsequently evaluated <i>in-vivo<\/i> in xenograft models of CYTA-sensitive and CYTA-resistant AML cell lines: DIACC2010 significantly improved overall survival as compared to CYTA in all models, with dose-dependent efficacy. On a mechanistic standpoint, DIACC2010-exposed AML cells displayed characteristic Golgi scattering leading to cell death, as hallmarks of DIACC2010 mode of action and target engagement. Altogether, these results confirm the relevance of KIF20A-directed therapeutic approaches and support the development of DIACC2010 for the treatment of AML.

We discovered that a member of the ABC transporter family called ABCC3 has a critical role in pancreatic cancer. ABCC3 blockade using genetic knockdown inhibits pancreatic cancer growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In addition, we demonstrate that knockdown of ABCC3 reduces cell proliferation by inhibition of STAT3 and HIF1&#945; signalling pathways, which are key regulators of pancreatic cancer progression. A focused chemical library of indenes was screened for ABCC3 inhibition using ABCC3 expressing pancreatic tumour cells. A drug development candidate, designated as S3, emerged following extensive chemical modification to optimize target selectivity and oral bioavailability. Oral administration of S3 significantly inhibited tumour growth and increased survival in several mouse models of pancreatic cancer without discernible toxicity. Interestingly, using the KPC transgenic mouse model that closely mimics human pancreatic cancer, we identified a dual activity of S3 to inhibit the growth of the primary tumour and impact the surrounding stroma. Strikingly, a significant increase in survival was achieved with S3 treatment compared to vehicle treated KPC mice. A two-fold increase in lifespan was observed from 72.5&#8201;days (median survival) in the control group to 146.5&#8201;days in the treatment group. Importantly, we observed no overt toxicity from S3 treatment at a dosage of 50 mg\/kg, which generated plasma levels exceeding growth inhibitory IC<sub>50<\/sub> values. Furthermore, we show that stromal cells in pancreatic tumours, which actively participate in cancer progression, are enriched for ABCC3, and that its inhibition may contribute to stroma reprogramming. In other studies, we found that S3 inhibits the closely related transporter, ABCC1, and that pharmacological inhibition of ABCC1 reduced prostate cancer cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and potentiated the effects of Docetaxel <i>in vitro<\/i> and in mouse models of prostate cancer <i>in vivo<\/i>. Mechanistically, we have shown that ABCC3, is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells and can efflux the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) which, in turn, activates its receptor G protein-coupled receptor 55 in an autocrine mitogenic loop. Similarly, ABCC1 mediates LPI efflux in prostate cancer cells. The fact that both ABCC1 and ABCC3 transport LPI and are inhibited by S3 is not surprising considering that they share a high primary sequence identity and are known to have overlapping substrate specificity. Interestingly, unlike known ABC inhibitors, S3 has anticancer activity as a single agent. Our goal is to further study the antitumor activity of S3 alone and in combination with conventional chemotherapy or molecular targeted drugs used for the treatment of pancreatic and prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ABC transporters,Lipids,G proteins,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12407"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marco Falasca<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gary Piazza<\/i><\/presenter>.

The pre|CISION<sup>&#8482;<\/sup> substrate can be utilized in a drug conjugate linker or to generate chemotherapy prodrugs that are only activated in the tumor microenvironment. AVA6000 consists of a doxorubicin molecule covalently bonded to a dipeptide (pyridine-4-carbonyl)-D-Ala-L-Pro), which is designed to be susceptible to hydrolysis by Fibroblast Activation Protein &#945; (FAP) but is resistant to hydrolysis by both closely related and wider mammalian peptidases. FAP, a post-prolyl endopeptidase, is overexpressed on the surface of activated fibroblastic cells which are abundant in the supporting stroma of over 90% of malignant epithelial cancers, as well as in bone and soft tissue sarcoma. While FAP is also present both in normal tissues and as a soluble enzyme in plasma, levels are significantly lower than those present in malignant epithelial cancers. Consequently, AVA6000 has the potential to deliver doxorubicin directly to the tumor microenvironment, while exposing the patient to a lesser degree of doxorubicin-associated toxicities. The primary mechanism of action of doxorubicin is thought to involve stabilisation of a topoisomerase-II-DNA cleavable complex through non-specific DNA-intercalation. The non-specific DNA-intercalation causes a number of downstream effects, which may ultimately result in apoptotic cell death. Although doxorubicin has been one of the most effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of various solid malignancies for over 40 years, its clinical utility is limited by dose-limiting toxicities, including myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. The unique FAP specificity of the N-(pyridine-4-carbonyl)-D-Ala-L-Pro leaving group conjugated to doxorubicin in AVA6000 is supported by the absence of cleavage of the fluorogenic analogue, 3114-AMC, in FAP gene-knockout mice (Fap<sup>-\/-<\/sup>). In vitro cytotoxicity assessments involving human tumor cell lines showed that AVA6000 was between 80-fold to 4,000-fold less cytotoxic compared to doxorubicin. In several in vivo efficacy studies in tumours with high FAP levels, AVA6000 significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival in a dose-dependent manner. In a PDX model of osteosarcoma, AVA6000 significantly decreased tumor volume while doxorubicin had no significant effect. The efficacy and tolerability profile of AVA6000 strongly support its clinical development, and a Phase I trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic selected solid tumours in underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/da3a8711-358b-420b-b917-bbba75589818\/@z03B8ZE6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Anthracycline,Prodrugs,Doxorubicin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12283"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fiona McLaughlin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah E.

Gene paralog pairs represent one promising class of synthetic lethal cancer targets, wherein the function of one paralog is lost in tumor cells, rendering them dependent on the remaining paralog to carry out an essential cellular process. To identify essential gene paralog pairs as starting points for drug discovery programs, we mined publicly available CRISPR genetic loss-of-function data and associated molecular datasets collected across a diverse panel of cancer cell lines. We first identified pairs of gene paralogs where one paralog was essential in a subset of cell lines, and then filtered these genes based on function, known literature, enrichment in specific lineages and integration of external datasets. These efforts identified VPS4A as a synthetic lethal target in cancers harboring copy number loss of VPS4B. VPS4A and VPS4B are highly homologous AAA ATPases that carry out multiple essential cellular processes including nuclear membrane remodeling and endosomal membrane biogenesis. VPS4B loss occurs as a passenger deletion during loss of the tumor suppressors SMAD2 and SMAD4. Loss of VPS4B creates a genetic dependency on VPS4A to drive essential VPS4-dependent processes. VPS4B deletion occurs at a frequency of up to 3% in multiple solid tumor types including esophageal, head and neck, pancreatic and colorectal cancers. To further explore the potential of VPS4A as a therapeutic target in VPS4B-deleted tumors, we first validated the synthetic lethal relationship between VPS4A\/B using isogenic cell line pairs. HCT116 cells with an engineered homozygous loss of VPS4B, but not wild-type HCT116 cells, showed profound cell kill in response to genetic silencing of VPS4A. Moreover, simultaneous siRNA-mediated knockdown of VPS4A and VPS4B resulted in cell death across a panel of cancer cell lines (e.g. H1975, Panc0403), while knockdown of either gene alone was compatible with cell viability. Encouraged by these results, we profiled several previously reported small-molecule inhibitors of VPS4A (e.g. DBeQ and MSC1094308) in a suite of biochemical assays. Notably, these molecules were inactive against VPS4A. We have discovered a novel series of VPS4A inhibitors and are advancing this inhibitor series through lead optimization. Potent, selective, and pharmacologically active VPS4A inhibitors are expected to be well tolerated and have strong single-agent activity in tumors bearing VPS4B homozygous deletions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b82be232-12d5-454e-a615-24ea4972fe52\/@z03B8ZE6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Small molecule inhibitor,Tumor suppressor,VPS4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12288"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"82b5b70e-6d0a-4deb-8d22-e3ce40556fc2","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82b5b70e-6d0a-4deb-8d22-e3ce40556fc2\/@z03B8ZE6\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meredith Kuo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sacha Holland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eugene Lurie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>An-Angela Ngoc Van<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Parlati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tayna Santos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Sjogren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalija Sotirovska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susanne Steggerda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew MacKinnon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Novel therapeutic targets are needed to improve the outcome of individuals with cancer. EG-011 is a small molecule with <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity in lymphoma and acute leukemias, but, at least so far, no activity in solid tumor models (Gaudio et al AACR 2019). Since no information was available on its target, we have now performed experiments showing that EG-011 targets WASp.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. Target identification: kinase screens with DiscoverX KINOMEscan, ProQinase Wildtype-Profiler; thermal proteomic profiling. Target validation: pyrene actin polymerization assay. <i>In vitro<\/i> drug treatment of cell lines followed for changes in actin filaments (F-actin) by confocal imaging with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. Extensive kinome screens excluded kinases as targets of EG-011. We then applied thermal proteomic profiling to identify new protein targets interacting with EG-011. Over 3,300 proteins from the soluble proteome from the EG-011 sensitive mantle cell lymphoma cell line REC1 were analyzed and 48 possible protein targets were initially identified. Among the proteins undergoing a thermal shift, WASp was among the most highly destabilized by EG-011. Due to the pattern of expression of WASp, compatible with the anti-tumor activity observed only in hematological cancers (Gaudio et al AACR 2019), we performed further experiments to confirm the possibility that EG-011 targets WASp. One of the main functions of WASp is the regulation of actin filaments formation. Pyrene actin polymerization assays demonstrated that EG-011 activated the auto-inhibited form of WASP with strong actin polymerization. Further confirmation was obtained using confocal imaging of cell lines exposed to DMSO or EG-011 (500 nM, 5 &#956;M) and stained for F-actin. An increase in actine polymerization was seen in EG-011 sensitive (VL51) and not in resistant (Z138) cell lines at 4, 8 and 24h with both concentrations.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. These data demonstrate that EG-011 is the &#8220;first-in-class&#8221; activator of the auto-inhibited form of WASp with selective anti-tumor activity in lymphomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e535dcef-51f0-436a-9655-50e897debcf6\/@z03B8ZE6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Actin cytoskeleton,WASP,Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,thermal proteomic profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12287"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Filippo Spriano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Barnabei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Maria Carrasco Del Amor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meagan R.

Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 6(TRPV6), a calcium channel characterized by its high calcium selectivity. It plays an important role in calcium absorption in small intestine and calcium uptake in other epithelial tissues. TRPV6 is also upregulated in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.<br \/>CBP-1008, A first-in-class drug conjugate which targets both FR&#945; and TRPV6 with low molecular-weight ligands has been developed. CBP-1008 binds to FR&#945; with high affinity and TRPV6 with low affinity. In presence of TRPV6, CBP-1008 shows faster FR&#945;-mediated internalization and cytotoxicity than it does in absence of TRPV6. Systemic clearance CBP-1008 is observed within 6 hrs. However, the drug retained and accumulated in tumors with a half-life over 48 hrs. As a result, CBP-1008 shows excellent efficacy on tumors with target expression and the response is durable. MTD of CBP-1008 reaches 4 mg\/kg in mice, 2 mg\/kg in rat and 1 mg\/kg in monkey.<br \/>During the development of molecularly-targeted therapeutics, biomarker assays which can stratify patients and enrich those who respond well to the therapy, play a very critical role. We generated an anti-TRPV6 antibody and developed a first-in-class IHC-based TRPV6 assay. This assay along with an FR&#945; IHC assay have been validated per CAP\/CLIA guidelines for patient selection in our clinical trials. Intended indications including ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, breast, NSCLC and pancreatic cancer. We have evaluated a panel of ovarian PDX models for their biomarker expression and response to CBP-1008 to determine their correlation. It is found that FR&#945;<sup>+<\/sup>\/TRPV6<sup>+<\/sup> tumor responds better than tumors which have at least one marker negative.

Deregulation of ALDHs have implications in a number of cancers and their elevated expression in cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been used as (1) markers for the identification and isolation of these rare cell types and (2) as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The elevated ALDH expression in tumors is also known to lead to chemotherapy-resistance including taxanes resistance. Although the exact role of ALDHs is not fully understood, emerging information indicates that several isoforms including ALDH1A1, 1A3, 3A1 and 7A1 play a key role in prostate cancer. To unravel ALDH isoform significance, more selective chemical tool compounds are required to probe their role in tumor growth, drug-resistance and CSC protection. To further elucidate the role of ALDHs in prostate cancer, we here report on the perturbation of ALDH expression and function using new chemical probes. <i>N,N<\/i>-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) is a well-known pan ALDH inhibitor, widely used to interrogate ALDH activity. However, its nonselective nature and reported ability to act as a substrate complicates its use for biological readouts, which we wanted to explore further. In this study, a new library of compounds were synthesized and evaluated in cell free and cell-based assays; particular focus was on understanding its interaction with the three key ALDH isoforms ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3 and ALDH3A1. Kinetic inhibitory studies using the human recombinant ALDH isoforms were performed for the whole library of DEAB analogues against ALDH1A1, 1A3 and 3A1. Among all results, compound <b>14<\/b> yielded selective results against ALDH1A3 (Ki of 0.46&#181;M), while compound <b>18<\/b> showed promising results against ALDH3A1 (Ki of 0.30&#181;M). Significantly, sixteen analogues displayed increased cytotoxicity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 10-200 &#181;M) compared with DEAB (&#62; 200 &#181;M) against three different prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, LNCaP, DU145). In addition, 3 of the DEAB-derivatives ALDH-affinic probe compounds (<b>9, 14<\/b> and <b>18<\/b>) were tested against 5 patient samples of primary prostate epithelial cultures at two doses (50 and 200 &#181;M) in order to investigate their effect on cell viability. All four compounds showed reduction in cell viability at the highest concentration, while <b>14<\/b> and <b>18<\/b> showed a synergistic effect in combination treatment with docetaxel. Similar observations were also evident in the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line.

We examined the effect of diets that promote NASH&#8212;a high-fat diet (HFD) or Western diet (WD)&#8212; and the outcomes of HCC induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Based on the phenotypes of these mice, we examined the therapeutic effects of knocking down Sptbn1 using siRNA.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Results<\/b>: We found LSKO mice were protected from HFD-induced obesity and NASH. Control mice administered siRNA targeting Sptbn1 were protected from developing NASH when placed on a HFD, and NASH phenotypes triggered by WD were reduced by administration of siRNA targeting Sptbn1. LSKO mice appeared to be protected from HFD-induced HCC: One of four HFD control mice developed liver tumors, but none of the three LSKO mice did. HFD-induced HCC is rare in mice, therefore we evaluated DEN-induced HCC. LSKO mice subjected to DEN with or without WD had less severe cancer than did wild-type mice. Compared to the HCC in the control mice, the number of liver tumors in the LSKO mice was lower, the size of the tumors was smaller, and the tumors were less proliferative based on KI67 staining intensity. Furthermore, overall liver pathology was reduced.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These data suggest that SPTBN1 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention to treat NASH and prevent progression to HCC. Because other injected siRNA therapies are approved to treat liver diseases, a siRNA-based therapy targeting SPTBN1 could translate into clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7934febd-5dc1-4e49-bd4f-e46f6760cb58\/@A03B8ZE7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,TGF-&#946;,siRNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12292"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaochun Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuyun Rao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiyan Xiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazufumi Ohshiro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Latham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirti Shetty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Lopa Mishra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

ZCCHC11 (also known as TUT4 and TENT3A) and ZCCHC6 (also known as TUT7 and TENT3B) catalyze uridylation of diverse RNA species. Recent evidence indicates that genetic perturbation of ZCCHC11\/6 expression can disrupt cell proliferation of both immortalized and patient-derived primary GBM cell lines (Kim et al., Mol Cell 2020). We confirmed that genetic inhibition of ZCCHC11\/6 with siRNA or CRISPR can decrease viability of U-87 MG and A-172 GBM cell lines, and we identified DK-MG as another GBM cell line with sensitivity to ZCCHC11\/6 knockdown. Herein, we report the first novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of ZCCHC11\/6, TS-1. Biochemically, TS-1 can block ZCCHC11\/6-mediated uridylation of an RNA substrate in vitro (IC50 = 0.65 nM for recombinant ZCCHC11 protein; IC50 = 9.6 nM for recombinant ZCCHC6 protein). ZCCHC11\/6 inhibitor TS-1 could decrease cell viability in U-87 MG, A-172 and DK-MG cells (cell viability IC50s ranging between 0.7-1.5 &#956;M) and induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. A cellular assay detecting uridylation of miR-191 as a marker for ZCCHC11\/6 activity was developed and validated. TS-1 strongly decreased uridylation of miR-191 in U-87 MG, A-172 and DK-MG cells (IC50 ranging between 10-40 nM). In contrast, TS-2, a weakly active enantiomer of TS-1 (enzyme IC50 = 0.15 &#956;M and 1.8 &#956;M against ZCCHC11 and ZCCHC6, respectively), had less impact on cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle and uridylation in cells. In conclusion, we have verified ZCCHC11\/6-dependency in a set of GBM cell lines and we have also developed a first-in class potent and selective small molecule that reduces in vitro Glioblastoma cell proliferation through selective inhibition of TUTases activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/af225045-92f0-4623-abf2-26b90bc69e7a\/@A03B8ZE7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,MicroRNA,Small molecule inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12297"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robinson Triboulet<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khikmet Sadykov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica L.

Treatment remains limited for advanced disease, calling for the development of novel therapies. We investigated the anti-tumor effect of three imipridones (ONC201, ONC206, and ONC212), a promising new class of small molecules, in the treatment of neuroblastoma. Imipridones are potent anticancer drugs that have previously shown efficacy for a variety of adult and pediatric malignancies. ONC201 and ONC206 are antagonists of dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), while ONC212 is an agonist of GPR132, both of which are overexpressed in many cancers. We performed drug treatment with ONC201, ONC206, and ONC212 on established <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified SK-N-BE(2) and <i>MYCN<\/i> non-amplified SH-SY5Y pediatric neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro. Cell viability assays were performed 72 hours post-treatment to generate dose responses curves. The IC50s for ONC201, ONC206, and ONC212 were 17.82 uM, 547 nM, and 70 nM for SK-N-BE(2), and 997 nM, 314 nM, and 6 nM for SH-SY5Y. Imipridones demonstrated greater efficacy for the non-<i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified cell line. Using protein quantification studies and downstream target analysis on drug-treated cells, we investigated the mechanisms of how these therapies caused cell death. We showed that imipridones inactivate cell proliferation kinases Akt\/ERK and induce cell death through the pro-apoptotic tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). They also induce tumor cell apoptosis by modifying the mitochondrial Clp protease complex, decreasing expression of chaperone subunit ClpX and activating mitochondrial proteolysis. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a role in controlling MYCN function, which is amplified in more aggressive neuroblastoma; HDAC activity and MYCN are also upregulated in chemotherapy-resistant neuroblastoma. Cell viability assays with HDAC inhibitors Vorinostat and Panobinostat demonstrated single-agent efficacy in vitro. The IC50s for Vorinostat and Panobinostat were 609 nM and 5.51 nM for SK-N-BE(2), and 884 nM and 6.13 nM for SH-SY5Y. However, further investigation is needed to determine synergy and mechanisms of synergy when histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are used in novel combinations with imipridones. Overall, our data reveals promise in imipridone therapy for neuroblastoma, and future studies are proposed to explore potential novel therapeutic combinations in this difficult-to-treat pediatric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d9af47d-3b9e-41a6-b9b8-4f89b164ad90\/@A03B8ZE7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Imipridone,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12296"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Claire Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen-I Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua N.

EZH2 inhibition has a complex role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in that it has been shown to be either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the stage of AML development and the genes that EZH2 is regulating during each stage. Unlike follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma where <i>EZH2<\/i> mutations result in gain of function, <i>EZH2<\/i> mutations are typically loss of function in myeloid diseases. However, we hypothesized that in AML patients without <i>EZH2<\/i> mutations, loss of EZH2 function may produce a phenotype that would allow for therapeutic targeting without influencing normal hematopoiesis.<br \/>We used EPZ011989 (EPZ), an EZH2 inhibitor tool compound, to inhibit H3K27me3 in our studies. We started by treating the MOLM-13 AML cell line with EPZ and confirmed a decrease in H3K27me3. This reduction in H3K27me3 resulted in a slight decrease in metabolic activity via MTS assays as well as decreased colony formation in methocult. These studies were followed up with EPZ inhibition in primary AML samples <i>in vitro<\/i>. We found that EZH2 inhibition resulted in decreased self-renewal of primary AML samples but not of CD34+ bone marrow cells from normal donors. Furthermore, we found that after 7-day treatment with EPZ, primary AML samples undergo moderate differentiation as suggested by an increase in CD11b surface expression via flow cytometry. These results are further supported by the morphological changes seen after 14-days of EPZ treatment <i>in vitro<\/i>. Based on these results, we hypothesize that EZH2 inhibition in primary AML samples promotes the differentiation of AML blasts. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggests that daily treatment with 150 mg\/kg of EPZ results in a survival advantage and reduced disease burden in the MOLM-13-luciferase murine xenograft model.<br \/>Despite loss of function <i>EZH2<\/i> mutations portending poor outcomes in myeloid malignancies, we demonstrate that pharmacologic EZH2 inhibition reduces AML blast stemness and promotes differentiation into mature myeloid cells. In contrast, no change in normal CD34+ stem cells occurs with EZH2 inhibition, offering the opportunity to selectively target myeloid leukemia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea517b25-9203-43b9-9ee8-508d71f027df\/@A03B8ZE7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Differentiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,EZH2,Differentiation,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12293"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sydney Fobare<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ola A.

We have previously shown that HB and treatment refractory HB has upregulation of class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) genes (<i>HDAC1-4<\/i>) through microarray, confirmed by RT-PCR. The highest consistent upregulation noted was with <i>HDAC 2 and 3<\/i>. Given this upregulation, we tested established and treatment refractory HB cell lines with <i>HDAC 2\/3<\/i> inhibitor, Romidepsin. We sought to characterize Romidepsin efficacy and mechanism of action.<br \/>Methods: Romidepsin was tested with cytotoxic assays (MTT). Tumor derived cell lines were treated with Romidepsin and evaluated for gene expression of p53 pathway via qRT-PCR. Immunoblotting assays were used to assess changes in expression of Acetyl-p53 at time points of 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours after 0.01 &#181;M concentrated Romidepsin treatment. Evaluation of the specific cell death pathway involved was performed via cell viability assays using 0.01 &#181;M concentration of Romidepsin in combination with cell death reversal agents including Z-VAD for apoptosis, 3-Methyladenine for autophagy, Necrostatin-1 for necroptosis, and Ferrostatin-1 for ferroptosis at 48 hours.<br \/>Results: Romidepsin (IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.001-0.02 &#181;M) showed strong in vitro effects for viability. HB cell lines treated with HDAC inhibitor had increased p21 and PUMA expression on RT-PCR, most notably at the 24-hour mark (p = &#60; 0.05). Acetyl p-53 was noted to increase in HUH-6 and Hep G2 throughout the 24 hours of treatment on western blots, while Hep T1 was noted to have no changes in expression. All cell lines showed the highest level of cell death reversal with ZVAD in cell viability assay after Romidepsin treatment. Hep T1 showed the highest cell death reversal with Romidepsin: relative cell viability of 52% (&#177;5%) versus 95% (&#177;2%) in ZVAD\/Romidepsin.<br \/>Conclusions: Romidepsin demonstrates strong <i>in vitro<\/i> efficacy and suggest HDAC 2\/3 inhibition may act through p53 mediated mechanism, notably acetylated p53. Cell death via apoptosis is further supported by cell death reversal with ZVAD\/Romidepsin treatment in HB cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,p53,Acetylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12295"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andres F.

However, DSF breaks down in the gut or blood immediately and chances of cupric diethyldithiocarbamate (Cu-DDC), the active cytotoxic principle being formed at tumor sites is very low. Therefore, we have found that synthetic Cu-DDC is directly and potently cytotoxic against p53 mutant cancers. We report here for the first time the differential effects of Cu-DDC in robustly eliminating the mutant p53 proteins from tumor cells in contrast to its augmentation of the wild-type p53 protein and activation. Destabilization of Gain Of Function (GOF) p53 mutant proteins for overcoming oncogenic addiction and improving the therapeutic efficacy has been a long-sought, but unmet anticancer avenue.<br \/>Methods: A panel of 7 P53 mutant cell lines (R248W, R273H,R173H), and p53 wt tumor and normal cells (HPBLs, dental pulp stem cells, IMR90 and HUVEC) were used. Immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, Annexin-V apoptotic assays, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry were used to quantitate p53 protein. Mia-Paca2 xenografts developed in nude mice were administered Cu-DDC\/BSA.<br \/>Results: Cu-DDC generated peroxides but not superoxides in tumor cells. The GOF mutant p53 proteins, R248W and R273H in three different tumor cell lines were eliminated after Cu-DDC treatment in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The loss of mutant p53 proteins was confirmed by three different procedures. The degradation occurred rapidly in 8-10 h at 100 nM Cu-DDC and was inhibited by proteasome blockers. The expression of the GRO-&#945; oncogene, positively regulated by GOF R248W was decreased in Cu-DDC treated Mia-Paca2 cells. Cellular proteasome activity was not inhibited by Cu-DDC. Ubiquitination of mutant p53 proteins was not altered by Cu-DDC. In contrast, the wild-type p53 present in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells, and normal cell counterparts (HPBL, IMR-90 lung cells) was significantly upregulated and activated with enhanced p21cip1 expression. Cu-DDC triggered strong apoptosis irrespective of the p53 status, although the mutant p53 containing cells were 2 to 3-fold more sensitive in cytotoxicity assays (IC<sub>50<\/sub> range 0.25-0.66 &#181;M). A significant tumor growth delay accompanied by loss of mutant p53 protein was observed in MiaPaca2 xenografts.<br \/>Conclusions: In moving the DSF anticancer repurposing forward, we describe the unique ability of Cu-DDC to rapidly eliminate oncogenic p53 mutant proteins and confer potent antitumor efficacy. The degradation was unrelated to the proteostasis involving the inactivation of NPL4 by Cu-DDC described previously (supported by a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas [CPRIT] grant RP170207 to KSS).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Drug discovery,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12294"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Viswanath Arutla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kalkunte S.

Although these patients are initially highly sensitive to first or second generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) including erlotinib or third-generation inhibitors including osimertinib, EGFR TKI-refractory disease inevitably emerges. While therapeutic strategies to target resistant disease that emerges though secondary EGFR mutations or <i>MET<\/i> amplification have been developed, there remains a void of therapeutic options for patients where resistance occurs through EGFR-independent mechanism such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) or transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC). To identify cell surface proteins that could be targeted by antibody-based or adoptive cell therapy approaches we interrogated RNAseq data from EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines (HCC827 and HCC4006) and their associated EGFR TKI resistant variants previously shown to have developed resistance through EMT and filtered gene expression data to include only genes which transcribed proteins localized to the cell surface. We identified CD70<i> <\/i>as a being highly upregulated in EGFR TKI resistant cells (p = 7.2e-42). Given that CD70 expression is highly restricted and only transiently expressed on immune cells, CD70 was selected as a top candidate cell surface protein for targeting studies. Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis confirmed CD70 protein levels to be highly upregulated in EGFR TKI resistant cells that had undergone EMT but not in cells harboring secondary <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations or <i>MET<\/i> amplifications. We also observed CD70 upregulation in osimertinib-treated drug tolerant persister cells, indicating that CD70 upregulation is an early event in the evolution of TKI resistance. Moreover, patient-derived models of acquired EGFR TKI resistance also exhibited CD70 positivity. Our data also indicated that in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells, CD70 could be upregulated through decreased CD70 promoter methylation as well as by the EMT regulators, transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;) and ZEB1, both of which were upregulated in TKI resistant cells. In EGFR TKI resistant cells, CD70 knockdown impaired cell viability and invasiveness, and stimulation of CD70 using the exogenous binding partner CD27 resulted in activation of AKT and MAPK, pathways known to be re-activated with acquired TKI resistance. CD70-targeting approaches including anti-CD70 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and CD70-targeting CAR T cell and CAR NK cells showed promising in vitro and in vivo activity against CD70 positive tumor cells and in osimertinib drug-tolerant persister cells. These results identify CD70 as a novel therapeutic target for EGFR mutant tumors with acquired EGFR TKI resistance that merits further investigation in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,CD70,Lung adenocarcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21681"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Monique B.
