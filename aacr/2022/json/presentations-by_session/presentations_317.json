[{"Abstract":"Introduction: The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic domain and communication hub for signaling molecules, contributing to proliferative and metastatic behaviors observed in cancerous tissues. Intercellular interactions are commonly mediated through extracellular vesicles that carry vital information for growth and survival, a feature that is highly advantageous for cancer cells to hijack. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most rapidly increasing types of cancer in the United States. Often aggressive, HCC arises from the uncontrollable division of hepatocytes, which may disrupt the regular functions of the liver and other organs. Identifying biomarkers is essential to potentiate drug treatments while minimizing chances of metastasis, recurrence, and mortality. Highly proliferative cells are known to secrete exosomes containing tumor-enhancing biomolecules that contribute to cancerous progression. Thus, analyzing exosomal cargo in serum is especially attractive for early diagnostics, profiling, and therapeutic purposes. We have explored potential oncogenic lncRNAs and extracellular signaling proteins in HCC and conducted phenotypic studies to observe their mode of action.<br \/>Methods: HCC cell lines were propagated in EMEM containing exosome-free FBS. Exosomes were harvested with ThermoFisher Total Exosome Isolation Reagent from cell culture media, then resuspended in PBS. Zetasizer was used to measure the sizes of harvested exosomes, and western blot analysis was used to confirm exosomal markers.. UCA1 and MALAT1 were checked via RTPCR via exosomes spiked with bacterial RNA as the loading control. Bradford assays were performed on exosomes lysed with RIPA for quantifying cargo proteins. Exosomal POTE-2 was observed through western blot analysis, in addition to ELISAs to identify their presence in media. Phenotypic studies were performed using isolated exosomes.<br \/>Results: The isolated exosomes were within the size range of 40-200nm, with a negative charge. The western blot of the exosomal markers confirmed their purity. RTPCR results showed LncRNAs MALAT1 and lncRNA UCA1 present in exosomes, whereas POTE-2 protein presence was confirmed with western blot. Phenotypic studies from the isolated exosomes are in progress.<br \/>Conclusions: Exosomes in serum are easily accessible biomolecules making them functional, less invasive targets for profiling, diagnostics, and therapeutics via liquid biopsies. Exosome-mediated delivery of lncRNAs MALAT1 and UCA1 to primary CRC cells has been found to promote malignancy. We have verified their presence in exosomes secreted by metastatic cell lines, in addition to oncoprotein POTE-2, which hold numerous significances for our phenotypic studies. These findings reaffirm exosomes as essential contributors to disease pathogenesis and present them as promising targets for diagnostics and treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/73222cd9-d001-47b5-82a8-64f0c8c08ae0\/@E03B8ZBG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,lncRNA,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12767"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adithya Anilkumar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia Leslie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Doxtater<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neeraj Chauhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bilal Hafeez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murali Yallapu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meena Jaggi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subhash Chauhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manish Tripathi<\/i><\/presenter>.

EVs are present in various types of body fluids, which can be easily used for diagnostic purpose. Prior research has explored numerous techniques for isolating and analyzing these EVs based on their physical and biochemical properties, however, the complexity of biological samples makes conventional EV isolation difficult to exclusively extract EVs of a certain type of cell. Current downstream analysis methods lack the ability to differentiate exosomes of different origins in a sample. Recent studies suggested the presence of certain proteins in cancer exosomes that facilitates preferential uptake of the exosomes by organ-specific cancer cells, called organotropism. Using this unique property, we devised a microfluidic platform to examine the uptake of specific exosomes onto their respective progenitor cell lines, thus aiming to use the interaction for cancer diagnosis purposes.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The <sup>Cell<\/sup>ExoChip was prepared following the standard PDMS-based soft lithography method. The device consists of an inlet and outlet, with dimensions of 22x22 mm with a cell capture area of about 50 mm<sup>2<\/sup>. The microfluidic device was functionalized by Streptavidin and the cancer cells were biotinylated with EZ-Link-NHS-Biotin to create an intense affinity between the cells and the device. We further injected dyed exosomes with different origins through the device and evaluated their specific uptake using fluorescence microscope.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The prepared <sup>Cell<\/sup>ExoChip successfully immobilized over 1,500 cells onto the surface and viability evaluation demonstrated that only 6.79% of the initial cells were sacrificed during the biotinylation and on-chip binding process. The average on-chip cell viability showed 75.47&#177;7.68 %. The uptake of lung cancer cell exosomes into three different cancer cell lines (lung, bladder and breast) was measured on chip. The relative uptake of lung cell exosomes by the respective lung cells was 100% compared to the bladder cells and breast cell which were 15.87% and 40.31%, respectively. We extended this specific uptake evaluation to other <sup>Lung<\/sup>Cell-<sup>Lung<\/sup>Exo combinations using H1650, A549, and in-house CTC cell line, CTCR5, and the results demonstrated the organotropism nature of the exosomes in lung cancer.<br \/><b>Discussion and conclusion:<\/b> We present a novel screening method to accurately characterize specific cancer-derived EVs using a microfluidic platform. This process bypasses the requirement of analyzing and profiling these embedded proteins prior to EV isolation. Our microfluidic device facilitates this interaction between cells and exosomes through the diagnosis process of liquid biopsy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a7d695fa-4135-47a7-b7a2-ee7fca224d18\/@E03B8ZBG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Exosomes,Microfluidics,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12769"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kruthi Srinivasa Raju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zeqi Niu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Marvar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shawn Fortna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nna-Emeka Onukwugha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yoon-Tae Kang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunitha Nagrath<\/i><\/presenter>.

Monitoring patient status clinically as MRD negative or MRD positive has become the basis for predicting outcomes, remission or reoccurrence, as well as determining therapeutic options. The three primary methods to assess MRD status in patients include Flow Cytometry (FC), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). All three are highly quantitative measurements with a high degree of sensitivity to detect &#8220;new&#8221; circulating tumor cells or ctDNA that can potentially indicate disease recurrence before it happens. The choice of MRD methodology usually depends on the tumor type, liquid or solid. Flow Cytometry has been widely used to monitor MRD status in patients with hematologic malignancies. Specifically designed MRD panels have been used clinically in CLL, MM, CML and AML patients. In addition to its prognostic\/diagnostic relevance, recent guidance by the FDA is now driving the use of MRD testing as a predictive biomarker\/endpoint for novel cancer drug development. NeoGenomics Pharma Services has provided flow cytometry MRD expertise to multiple sponsors conducting clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of novel cancer therapy. In a CLL study, NeoGenomics employed the ERIC MRD assessment to monitor patient status during therapeutic intervention at various points throughout treatment. Representative patient data show progression from full, active disease prior to therapy to non-detectable disease levels below 0.01%MRD. These examples show patient progression through multiple cycles of treatment to full remission. Clearly, this is an example of how MRD can serve as the primary &#8220;biomarker&#8221; to evaluate a patient&#8217;s response to novel drug therapy in clinical trials. This presentation will further discuss the data and the relevance of MRD testing to support new drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bc644bbc-8b60-4091-9bde-c51666068710\/@E03B8ZBG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Flow cytometry,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Minimal Residual Disease,MRD,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12770"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicholas Jones<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Ngo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Floyd Davis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Fancke<\/i><\/presenter>.

Evidence of molecular residual disease (MRD), after treatment with curative intent (surgery, chemotherapy), predating macroscopic recurrence can provide rationale for early therapeutic intervention, potentially improving patient outcomes. Longitudinal evaluation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a promising early marker of treatment efficacy and recurrence, validated to pre-date recurrence by radiological imaging. However, data in early TNBC (eTNBC) are limited. Here we investigate the prognostic value of longitudinal ctDNA monitoring in eTNBC patients post-surgery and after adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) using a custom bespoke ctDNA assay.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tumor tissue and longitudinal post-surgical plasma samples were collected and analyzed from 186 patients enrolled in the phase 3 BEATRICE clinical study (NCT00528567). Samples from each patient were whole exome sequenced to identify up to 16 SNVs for ctDNA monitoring. ctDNA status was measured longitudinally and correlated with baseline prognostic factors as well as invasive disease free survival (iDFS) and overall survival (OS).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Baseline ctDNA (b-ctDNA), evaluated post-surgery and prior to chemotherapy was detected in 19.9% (36\/181) of patients. b-ctDNA was positively associated with large tumors and lymph node (LN) involvement, and negatively correlated with presence of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). b-ctDNA presence was a stronger predictor of shorter IDFS and OS compared to LN involvement (HR IDFS: 4.36 [2.47-7.7] vs 1.86 [1.08-3.19]; HR OS: 4.01 [1.6-10.07] vs 2.89 [1.39-6]]), respectively). Remarkably, b-ctDNA prognostic value was restricted to LN+ pts (HR IDFS: 10.94 [3.2-37.41]) vs LN- pts (HR IDFS 1.61 [0.49-5.36]). ctDNA positivity after ACT was observed in 21.5% (40\/186) of patients and was associated with reduced IDFS and OS (HR: 8.36 [4.62-15.1] and 18.45 [6.79-50.17]), independent of LN involvement. Upon chemotherapy treatment, the median time to first ctDNA positivity occurrence was 13 months (range 3-42.3 mo) and the median lead time from ctDNA detection to radiographic recurrence was 6.1 months (range 0-30.5 mo). Akaike information criterion (AIC, p&#60;0.05) indicated that ctDNA detected post-surgery or post-chemotherapy identifies patients at the highest risk of disease progression even after adjustment for LN and TILs status as well as the tumor size.<br \/><b> <\/b><b>Conclusions:<\/b> ctDNA, both at post-surgery and post-ACT, provides additional prognostic value beyond the known risk factors of LN involvement, tumor size and TILs. Post-op ctDNA+ provides an independent and stronger indicator of poor prognosis than any other evaluated baseline covariates. Our data show that TNBC pts that are ctDNA+ post-surgery are at the highest risk of recurrence and death and are underserved by current SOC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7580e484-372f-4dbc-bcc5-d93092b1d97f\/@E03B8ZBG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Circulating tumor DNA,Adjuvant,Prognostic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12773"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luciana Molinero<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derrick Renner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsin-Ta Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nina Qi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajesh Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ching-Wei Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Himanshu Sethi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexey Aleshin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Bais<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Cameron<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus, lung cancer is usually diagnosed in stage 3 or 4, when it is too late for successful treatment. However, if diagnosed early, it can be cured entirely. Therefore, it is necessary to find a suitable method to screen the high-risk populations and reveal lung cancer in the early stages. Since the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract are naturally moistened by fluids containing proteins, metabolites, chemoattractants and growth factors released by the highly active epithelium, the collection of the respiratory tract fluids can be used to diagnose malignant and benign respiratory tract diseases. The most commonly used method in this sense is bronchoalveolar lavage. However, the technique itself is not pleasant and can be accompanied by possible complications. Therefore, intensive research work is conducted to develop non-invasive methods for biomarker detection in exhaled breath, sputum, saliva or nasal secretion. We have studied an exhaled breath condensate (EBC) matrix, which is collected non-invasively and the patients are not suffering from its collection. Several studies have reported proteomic analysis of EBC while identifying low hundreds of proteins by mass spectrometry (MS). We have developed a potent gel-free MS-based approach for sample preparation and analysis. Together with a powerful search tool, we were able to identify a ten times higher number of proteins across a comparable group of individuals of about three hundred peoples&#8217; samples. Our approach seems to be highly reproducible and applicable to various respiratory and systemic diseases. In our work focused on non-small lung cancer biomarkers compared to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and healthy controls, we have identified 7694 proteins and of them, 6525 proteins were quantified at least in one replicate across 296 individuals&#8217; samples measured in triplicates. Combining univariate and multivariate statistical approaches and sensitivity analysis, we have suggested biomarkers that could distinguish lung cancer patients from COPD and healthy individuals.

Recently, individual nuclear transport proteins have been reported to be secreted by cancer cells and found in the serum of cancer patients. In this study we investigated a multi-marker panel of nuclear transport proteins for their potential as diagnostic markers for cancer using cervical and oesophageal cancer as disease models. Mass spectrometry identified ten nuclear transport proteins in the secretome and exosomes of cultured cancer cells which was confirmed by western blot analysis showing increased secreted levels in cancer cells compared to normal. The presence of multiple nuclear transport proteins was confirmed in patient serum using ELISA assays which revealed significantly increased levels of KPN&#946;1, CRM1, CAS, IPO5 and TNPO1 in cervical and oesophageal cancer patient serum compared to non-cancer controls. Significantly elevated KPN&#945;2 and RAN levels were also identified in oesophageal cancer serum samples. Logistics regression analyses revealed IPO5 and TNPO1 to be the best performing individual candidate biomarkers in discriminating between cancer cases and controls. The combination of KPN&#946;1, CRM1, KPN&#945;2, CAS, RAN, IPO5 and TNPO1 as a multi-marker panel of biomarkers had the highest diagnostic capacity with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.944 and 0.963, for cervical cancer and oesophageal cancer, and sensitivity of 92.5 % at 86.8 % specificity and 95.3 % sensitivity at 87.5 % specificity, respectively. These results suggest that nuclear transport proteins have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for cervical and oesophageal cancers, with a multi-panel protein combination being the best predictor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/313799d4-89c6-4001-9358-c8e45bbd1936\/@F03B8ZBH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Cancer diagnostics,Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12775"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Pauline Van der Watt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Okpara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Wishart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iqbal Parker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nelson Soares<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Blackburn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Virna D.

It presents a major threat to human health, particularly in East Asia and Southeast Asia. NPC commonly invades adjacent tissues and organs, resulting in complex and difficult to treat clinical presentations. NPC commonly remains largely asymptomatic during early disease stages due to its small primary foci. Hence, NPC patients are diagnosed mostly at advanced stage. Currently, no accurate and effective methods are available for the early diagnosis, evaluation, or prognosis for NPC. While Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA and EBV serology tests have been advocated for early diagnosis and screening for NPC, the sensitivities of these two tests vary. due to the fact that only a small proportion of individuals infected with EBV ultimately develop NPC. The ability to detect neoplasms at early stages provides useful information for early intervention. We have recently demonstrated that interrogating the serum glycoproteome, using a proprietary platform that couples artificial intelligence (AI) to targeted liquid chromatography-massspectrometry (LC-MS) yields highly informative biomarkers in a range of neoplastic diseases. Experimental procedures in this proof-of-principle study, a total of 106 plasma samples (1:1 ratio of histologically confirmed cases of NPC and cancer-free controls), which were matched for age (average 49 years) were used. All subjects were male, from a multi-ethnic patient population in Malaysia, including three ethnic minority groups (Bidayuh, Iban and Kadaza) . To identify diagnostic glycoprotein profiles for NPC we applied an in-house developed targeted glycoproteomics workflow, whereby plasma proteins were first digested with trypsin\/LysC, followed by targeted analysis using LC-MS. The LC-MS generated chromatographic peaks were integrated using an in-house AI-based software for high throughput analysis and further subjected to multivariate statistical analysis. Summary of new data among the 579 glycopeptides interrogated in this study we found 62 glycopeptides statistically significantly abundant in NPC cases compared to healthy controls (at FDR &#60;0.1). From these, we built a predictive algorithm that differentiates NPC cases from controls with high sensitivity and selectivity (AUC of 0.955). Six glycopeptide markers were found as associated with ethnicity.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, our results indicate that LC-MS-based glycopeptide profiling provides a highly accurate means of for differentiating NPC cases from healthy controls. Follow-up studies with larger sample size are currently in progress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd0d498c-cbe1-4a7a-9674-5f9a2c8e85f9\/@F03B8ZBH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12777"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Klaus Lindpaintner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thi Thin Aye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gege Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Rice<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Mtchell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Serie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>A Malek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>LH Low<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lp Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ct Low<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cy Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>H Sawali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yy Yapp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>As Khoo<\/i><\/presenter>.

The DNA methylation pattern can vary between individuals with or without cancer and also in patients with cancer of different origins. In this study, we investigated the discovery of comprehensive markers and validation of the diagnostic and prognostic potential of colorectal cancer.<br \/>Methods: Patients with various stage of colorectal cancer were eligible for the current study, mainly stage III. We generated genome-wide methylation data from 379 colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and 330 available paired adjacent normal mucosa tissues from Korean patients by Illumina EPIC Human Methylation microarray targeting 860,000~ CpG sites. A machine learning algorithm was used to build an optimized prediction model and select the tumor specific markers based on through theses CpG sites. Then, the risk score was devised for prognosis using this marker set. Finally, in order to validate the rule of CpG sites, the genomic location and pathway enrichment analysis was performed by CHROMHMM and Metascape.<br \/>Results: 379 colorectal cancer tissues and 330 paired adjacent normal mucosal tissues were included for analysis. Clinical stages of the included patients were, III in N (61.2%), II in N (19.5%), and IV in N (11.9%). A total of 305 methylation markers that showed statistically significant differences between normal and cancer tissues were selected. Our model could accurately identify CRC (areas under the curve for the training and validation cohorts: 0.968 and 0.984, respectively). Using our prediction model, the colorectal cancer patients were predicted as colorectal cancer accurately in the methylation data from TCGA (COREAD; colorectal cancer tissue DNA) and GEO dataset (plasma cfDNA from colorectal cancer patients). The risk score comprising the subset of 305 methylation markers was calculated, and poor prognosis was predicted in the high-risk score group (overall survival P &#60;0.1, progression-free survival P &#60; 0.01). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the 305 CpG sites were enriched in transcription regulatory regions (160\/305, 52.5%) and were associated with developmental process and carcinogenesis (GO: 0032502, P &#60;0.001; C4721208, P &#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, the performance of our prediction model with these 305 CpG sites was highly accurate for CRC diagnosis, and the optimized risk score could predict the prognosis of Korean CRC patients","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb4b37b7-4121-4747-94b5-fc4a95a4ebcf\/@F03B8ZBH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,DNA methylation,Diagnosis,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12778"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jun-Kyu Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Su Yeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoojoo Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Hwang-Phill Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae-You Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Patient selection for SL-based therapy may be improved by assessment of gene-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and biallelic LOF, neither of which is routinely reported by existing targeted sequencing panels. The Synthetic Lethal Interactions for Precision Diagnostics (SNiPDx) targeted sequencing panel features a novel bioinformatic analysis pipeline that enables accurate genome-wide determination of allele-specific copy number, estimation of tumor ploidy and purity, and detection of single nucleotide and indel variants in target genes focused on DDR pathways, all from tumor-only samples. Here we describe the development and accuracy of SNiPDx for detection of LOH and bi-allelic LOF genetic alterations in FFPE samples.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Genomic DNA (&#62;50 ng) was extracted from FFPE samples of multiple solid tumor types (n = 43). Next-generation sequencing was performed on anchored multiplex PCR libraries, constructed using probes that incorporate unique molecular identifiers and span 26 genes and 5,000 genome-wide common germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Unmatched non-tumor samples (n = 24) were used to generate a reference baseline dataset. The FACETS algorithm, optimized to account for differential DNA fragmentation across samples, was used to assess copy number imbalance in heterozygous SNPs and to quantify tumor purity. Allele fractions at each heterozygous SNP were used to estimate allelic imbalances across chromosomal regions. A reference dataset was derived from matched FFPE tumor samples by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and analysis of sequence data using 3 complementary algorithms. Allele-specific copy number analysis and tumor purity estimation from SNiPDx and WGS data were compared.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Copy number was evaluable in 605 genes from 24 matched tumor samples that passed quality control filters. Median sequencing depth across samples by SNiPDx and WGS were 1346x and 18.6x, respectively.

Prognosis of the patients with CRC depends mainly on the extent of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, the early detection of CRC and precancerous lesions is one of the main requirements of successful treatment. In recent years exosomes emerged as potential reservoirs of clinically useful biomarkers. Exosomes are 30-150 nm sized membranous vesicles that are endogenously produced by almost all cell types. They participate in intercellular communication by delivering proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), mRNAs or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to recipient cells. In the context of cancer, intercellular communication allows cancer cells to create a favorable microenvironment for their growth. It has been shown that cancer-derived exosomes promote pathways contributing to hallmarks of cancer.To investigate diagnostic potential of exosomal RNA in CRC, blood serum samples were collected from patients with CRC and age- and sex-matched controls. Exosome isolation protocol was optimized, and the presence of vesicles in the exosome size range was confirmed using both dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis as well as electron microscopy (TEM). Downstream analysis of serum exosomal RNA using next-generation sequencing (Illumina NextSeq 550) from exploratory cohort of CRC samples (N=50) and healthy controls (N=20) revealed both coding and non-coding RNAs to be differentially expressed (FC&#62;1.5, p-value &#60; 0.01). Among these were genes already reported to be dysregulated in CRC such as GAS5, but also lncRNAs previously unreported in CRC exosomes (AC103760.1, LINC02709 or PGBP) were identified.<br \/>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to link RNAs identified within exosomes to their molecular functions. Using the Hallmark gene sets (MsigDB) as a reference, we discovered high enrichment of genes related to MYC targets, E2F targets and G2M checkpoint in healthy controls compared to CRC samples. All three hallmarks comprise genes crucial for cell proliferation. The first results indicated that the exosomal RNAs could be promising candidates as new diagnostic biomarkers in CRC, although further <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> exploration of identified differentially expressed lncRNAs is necessary.

The MAGEA members lack of expression in normal tissue and their role in cancer make them well suited for targeted cancer immunotherapy. Thus, knowing which MAGEA protein expression exists in a tumor is important. However, the MAGEA family shares sequence similarity that makes it difficult to find antibodies that are specific to just one family member. It is also challenging to source tissue generally with HIPAA regulation and even more so to get tissue representation of all 12 MAGEA family members. Here we present CytoSections as an alternative to patient control tissues. CytoSections are formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) section of over-expression cell pellets. These cells were transfected with expression plasmids coding for genes of individual MAGES family. In this study, CytoSections are used to screen antibodies to all 12-member MAGEA family of proteins. The MAGEA family members were initially shown positive by targeted protein expression in western and immunohistochemistry using DDK tag antibody. Then multiple MAGEA3, MAGEA4, MAGEA9 antibodies were assessed by IHC to determine their specificity to their intended target. Using MAGEA family as a pilot project, we show that CytoSections is a verified, reproducible, and renewable alternative to human control tissues and serves as an ideal tool for antibody specificity assessment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86627463-693e-4fe7-94ef-1dab69d3eba6\/@F03B8ZBH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunoassay,MAGEA3, MAGEA4, MAGEA9,Tissue Control Model,Immunotherapy ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12781"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eden B.

Evaluation of the PD1-PDL1 interaction as a potential biomarker has not been explored because of the lack of a suitable assay. We previously reported on a novel technology called the LIRECAP (<u>Li<\/u>gand-<u>Re<\/u>ceptor <u>C<\/u>omplex-binding <u>Ap<\/u>tamer) assay that quantifies the fractional occupancy of a receptor by its ligand (PMID: 31383650). LIRECAP assay is based on two RNA aptamers with differential binding to the unoccupied receptor vs. the ligand-receptor complex, where the ratio of aptamer binding reflects fractional occupancy. Here, we report the generation of RNA aptamers for use in a LIRECAP assay to quantify PD1-PDL1 interactions in tumor.<br \/>Methods: <i>SELEX<\/i>: RNA aptamers were enriched using a variation of SELEX that consisted of pre-clearing followed by a positive selection against human PD1, PDL or the PD1-PDL1 complex. Target-bound aptamers were extracted, amplified with SEL2 primers and transcribed. After eight rounds, enriched aptamers were sequenced and lead aptamers were identified. Assessing target binding: Dynabeads were coated with recombinant PD1 alone or PDL1 alone. Complex-coated beads were made by incubating PD1-bound beads with PDL1. Beads were formalin-fixed to mimic biospecimens and prevent PD1-PDL1 dissociation. Aptamers were added to beads, unbound aptamers washed off and bound aptamers extracted and quantified by SYBR green-based RT-qPCR using SEL2 primers. Binding of each aptamer was normalized to the binding of unselected aptamer library (Rd0).<br \/>Results: (1) A progressive enrichment of unique sequences was seen in all the three SELEX (PD1, PDL1, Complex) with maximum enrichment reached between rounds 4 and 5. (2) Binding of aptamers: Most of the lead candidates showed predominant binding to the targets against which they were enriched. (a) Three out of four lead aptamers from the PD1 SELEX showed significantly higher binding to unoccupied PD1 than to PD1-PDL1 complex (p&#60;0.05). (b) Two out of five lead aptamers from the PDL1 SELEX showed significantly higher binding to unoccupied PDL1 compared to the complex (p&#60;0.05). (c) Four out of five lead aptamers from the Complex SELEX showed significantly higher binding to PD1-PDL1 complex than to unoccupied PD1 (p&#60;0.05). None of these aptamers showed cross-reactivity to unoccupied PDL1.<br \/>Conclusions and Significance: Novel RNA aptamers with differential specificity towards PD1, PDL1 or PD1-PDL1 complex have been successfully created for use in a LIRECAP assay that will be used to quantify the fractional occupancy of PD1 by PDL1 in tumor biospecimens. Studies assessing whether the resulting assay can predict response to anti-PD1 therapy are expected to begin shortly.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5d07dbca-9559-4082-ac2c-f2906a3db32f\/@F03B8ZBH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint,PD-1,PD-L1,Aptamer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12784"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Suresh Veeramani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Travis Fischer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William H.

Barrett&#8217;s esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor to EAC. At present, HER-2 and anti-PD-L1 therapies are FDA-approved for EAC, and off-label use of EGFR-directed therapy has been reported. Our study aims to use liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) to measure the expression of oncoproteins that are currently approved-drug targets in EAC and explore new promising targets for drug development and diagnostic applications for EAC and BE.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> EAC patients who underwent esophagectomy without chemo-radiation were identified. BE patients with subsequent progression to EAC and those without progression for &#62;10 years were identified. Normal esophageal mucosa tissues with no history of progression were analyzed for baseline expression. Tissue sections were microdissected to isolate pure EAC, BE and normal mucosal cells from stroma. These biopsies were solubilized for LC\/MS-based quantification of 80+ clinically relevant tumor markers including novel markers which are believed to play a role in the disease progression from BE to EAC. The expression trends of these markers were scrutinized by immunofluorescence (IF) in a subset of specimens\/biomarkers to confirm mass spec results.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 159 tissues were analyzed via LC-MS. In 55 EAC tissues - HER2, PD-L1 and EGFR were overexpressed in 16.3%, 0%, and 0% of patients, respectively. New markers DAD1 and S100P were noted to have high (7,634.0 and 27,222.6 attomoles\/ug) and consistent (98.1% and 94.5%) overexpression in EAC samples. Expression of HER2, S100P and DAD1 were significantly higher in EAC compared to 23 normal esophageal mucosa specimens. There was no statistical difference in the expression of PD-L1 and EGFR between EAC and healthy mucosal samples. 45 BE biopsies progressed to EAC within a mean of 380 days, while the remaining 36 BE specimens did not progress over a 10-year period. 8 novel biomarkers were expressed at a higher level in BE tissue that progressed to cancer when compared to esophageal tissue that remained stable over 10 years. The expression trends observed via LC\/MS were confirmed via IF in DAD1, S100P and two other novel markers.<br \/><b>Discussion:<\/b> LC-MS revealed low prevalence of target proteins in currently approved EAC therapies and high levels of newly discovered disease drivers that should be explored as possible therapy targets or diagnostic markers. The differential overexpression of the novel markers in progressive and non-progressive BE tissues, as well as the consistent overexpression of these markers in EAC tumors, demonstrates the potential for early detection of esophageal carcinogenesis and\/or reveals potential therapeutic programs for an indication that lacks highly efficacious targeted therapy options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0bf14ab6-97cc-44d2-9407-b3026a628d47\/@o03B8ZBJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Mass spectrometry,Esophageal cancer,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12785"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher Hartley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Bansal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Hagen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Driscoll<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seyun Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joe Abdo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sumeet K.

This genetic instability is often observed in tumor cells with impaired mismatch repair (MMR), especially in colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer. MSI-high tumors can help identify patients that would benefit from additional genetic testing to diagnose Lynch Syndrome. Additionally, MSI can potentially be used as a biomarker to predict response to treatment with immunotherapy and CRC patients with MSI have a significantly better prognosis compared to those with intact mismatch repair. Here we present the VarTrace&#174; MSI Research qPCR Assay, which enables high sensitivity detection of microsatellite instability. The assay uses NuProbe&#8217;s PCR-based Blocker Displacement Amplification (BDA) technology to enable the selective amplification of MSI unstable alleles with 1% analytical limit of detection. The assay is intended for the qualitative detection of mutations in 5 MSI loci (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24 and MONO-27) without the need of matched normal, and reports MSI-high (MSI-H), MSI-low (MSI-L) and Microsatellite Stable (MSS). Analytical validation of the assay has been completed on Horizon MSI\/MSS formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) DNA reference standard, SeraCare MSI AF5% reference panel mix, and 50 CRC FFPE samples. One FFPE section with as little as 2ng of input DNA is enough for this assay. The high sensitivity potentially allows for the detection of MSI status in liquid biopsy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2913848d-2812-4801-a6db-0c5ab6900a06\/@o03B8ZBJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Lynch Syndrome,Microsatellite instability,Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12787"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yan Helen Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Blake Young<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiheng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Yaseen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Pinto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

We elected to re-investigate ERBB receptors in endocrine treatment-resistant lethal PC, hypothesizing that targeting ERBB receptors merits further evaluation in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC).<br \/><b>Design: <\/b>We analyzed matching, same-patient, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) treatment-na&#239;ve, castration-sensitive PC (CSPC) samples (n=88), and mCRPC biopsies (n=51), from patients treated at The Royal Marsden Hospital, UK. Samples were stained for HER2 and HER3 protein, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), data was generated through digital image analysis and results were analyzed against clinical characteristics and outcome data. Moreover, we treated HER3 high (CP50) and low (CP142) expressing patient derived xenograft (PDX) models with anti-HER3 antibody-drug conjugate (HER3-ADC) U3-1402 (10mg\/Kg), IgG-ADC (MAAA-9289, 10mg\/Kg), anti-HER3 antibody Patritumab (U3-1287, 10mg\/Kg) and 10mM acetate buffer-5% sorbitol-pH 5.5 as vehicle control, <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo.<\/i> <i>In vitro<\/i> cell growth inhibitory activity was monitored for 7-days with endpoint assay luminescence. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy was evaluated comparing tumor volumes, measured every 2-3 days. Statistical significance was analyzed using ANOVA with Dunnett&#8217;s multiple comparisons correction test.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Membranous HER2 (mHER2) and HER3 (mHER3) proteins were detectable in both CSPC and mCRPC biopsies, with HER3 being highly expressed in many tumors. The median optical density (OD) for mHER3 expression at diagnosis was 2958.0; PC with high mHER3 expression (&#62; median OD; n=44) had a significantly shorter median time to CRPC (20.3 vs 14.2 months; p=0.016) and worse overall survival (OS) (79.0 vs 48.8 months; p=0.04) compared to CSPC with low mHER3 (&#8804; median; n=44). mHER2 staining did not associate with outcome. U3-1402 demonstrated <i>in vivo<\/i> potent and sustained antitumor activity in CP50, without inducing any body weight loss or apparent toxicity. Additionally, no tumor regrowth was observed up to 60-days following the end of dosing. This anti-HER3-ADC had minimal antitumor activity in CP142, highlighting the relevance of high HER3 expression as a functional therapeutic target.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>HER3 is commonly expressed in advanced PC and has clinical relevance in this setting. Our data indicate that HER3 is a valid target for clinical trials for men suffering from high HER3 expressing advanced PC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d47d7923-e081-42db-b3a7-a31b1cbca9b0\/@o03B8ZBJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Prostate cancer,ErbB3,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12825"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susana Miranda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Gil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruth Riisnaes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bora Gurel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariantonietta D’Ambrosio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Vasciaveo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mateus Crespo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Ferreira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniela Brina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Troiani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Sharp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beshara Sheehan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rossitza Christova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Seed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ines Figueiredo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maryou Lambros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Dolling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Rekowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdullah Alajati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Clarke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rita Pereira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Penny Flohr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gemma Fowler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gunther Boysen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Semini Sumanasuriya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diletta Bianchini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pasquale Rescigno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caterina Aversa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nina Tunariu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alec Paschalis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Bertan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorenzo Buroni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Ning<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne Carreira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Workman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Swain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Califano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael M.

It accounts for 2% of all new UK cancer diagnoses and is the 6<sup>th<\/sup> leading cause of cancer death. Favourable subsets of CUP exist, based on clinico-pathological features, and although these patients have improved clinical outcomes, they make up only 20% of patients with CUP. The evolution of molecular profiling and tissue-of-origin (TOO) classifiers has the potential to transform diagnosis and management of patients with CUP. Reliable molecular profiling requires good quality and quantity tumour tissue material, often scarce in patients with CUP. Liquid biopsies offer an alternative, minimally invasive approach. We developed a novel cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based multi-omics assay combining methylation profiling with mutation and copy number alterations (CNA) detection, to enable TOO prediction and biomarker discovery to aid treatment stratification.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Two novel library preparation methods were applied to 41 CUP cfDNA samples, 80 non-cancer controls and 80 cfDNA samples from known tumour types (breast, lung, colorectal cancer): 1) Targeted (641 gene panel) next generation sequencing (NGS); 2) A multiplex genome-wide methylation capture assay (T7-MBDSeq). Both sequencing outputs can estimate CNA. Cancer Genome Interpreter (CGI) was used to evaluate the potential actionability of molecular alterations detected. A novel TOO classifier, generated utilising <i>in silico<\/i> dilution mixture sets derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) methylation data, demonstrated an AUROC of 0.96 across 15 different cancer groups. This was applied to cfDNA methylation data from known tumour types to test performance accuracy and subsequently applied to CUP cfDNA samples.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Multi-omics profiling from cfDNA was completed for 34\/41 patients with CUP. cfDNA mutation profiling and estimated CNA analysis so far revealed &#62;350 alterations across 225 genes. 17\/34 (50%) of patients harboured potentially actionable alterations by CGI and, where performed, 68% of tumour mutations were concordant in the cfDNA. cfDNA methylation profiling revealed tumour-specific methylation changes in breast, lung and colorectal cancers. Our preliminary TOO classifier performance in these tumour types had an overall sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 98%, respectively. In patients with CUP, a predicted TOO was made in 26\/41 (63%) patients and for 6 patients, where a subsequent primary tumour diagnosis was made, the TOO prediction was correct.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> cfDNA multi-omics profiling revealed potential therapeutic benefit in 77% of this retrospective CUP cohort and illustrates the potential to re-classify patients to primary tumour types where alternative therapies may improve clinical outcomes. Further multi-omics cfDNA profiling of the CUP cohort and validation in known primary cancer types are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aacfdd00-3bc8-4b7a-b492-3581d40f6b02\/@o03B8ZBJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cancer diagnostics,DNA methylation,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21122"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alicia-Marie Conway<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Clipson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Chemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Pearce<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katarzyna Kamieniecka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saba Ferdous<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Richardson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elaine Kilgour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew G.

Serum CA125 has been explored as an OC biomarker for the past 40 years, but lacks sensitivity for early stage OC and is not recommended for screening average-risk, asymptomatic women. We hypothesize that co-localization of biomarkers on the surface of individual extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are shed into the circulation by cancer cells, may lead to development of a blood test for early stage OC. We evaluated the potential of our approach in detecting early stage OC in clinical samples.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We isolated EVs using size-exclusion chromatography and immunoaffinity capture, and detected biomarkers co-localized on the surface of individual EVs with proximity ligation qPCR. Using this approach, we evaluated 49 antibody combinations recognizing 2 or more biomarkers. Each combination consisted of 1 capture antibody and 2 oligonucleotide-tagged detection antibodies. We tested plasma samples from women with early stage I\/II high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC)(n=18; 48-80 yr, med 57) and late stage HGSOC (n=24; 37-80 yr, med 54). HGSOC samples were sourced from 2 commercial vendors. Controls comprised samples from women with benign ovarian masses (n=26; 23-76 yr, med 39.5) sourced from a single vendor, and samples prospectively collected by Mercy from healthy women with no cancer history (n=24; 22-72 yr, med 52.5). PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were measured for each of 49 combinations and data was evaluated using univariate analysis. Performance was compared to plasma CA125 measured at Mercy by commercial ELISA.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 8 of 49 combinations distinguished all stages of HGSOC relative to benign and healthy controls with AUCs ranging from 0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.94) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.90-1.00), comparable to CA125 with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.95). One of the most effective combinations (STn, BST2, MUC1) had a sensitivity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.52-0.94) at a specificity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.87-0.99) in detecting early stage HGSOC. This combination also detected HGSOC in 6 of 11 women (3 early stage, 3 late stage) with normal CA125 (&#60; 25 U\/mL) and correctly classified 7 of 8 women with benign masses and high CA125 (&#62; 25 U\/mL).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These preliminary data suggest that co-localization of surface biomarkers in single EVs may provide an effective means to identify women with early stage HGSOC, including those with normal CA125, while avoiding false positives in women with benign masses and high CA125. Despite the inherent challenges associated with commercial samples, our finding that several combinations detected early stage HGSOC is promising. Statistically powered studies with curated repository specimens are underway to refine combinations and independently validate our assay for early stage OC detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0c7f3f99-f957-4993-9b89-824416af900b\/@o03B8ZBJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Biomarkers,Screening,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21615"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Laura T.
