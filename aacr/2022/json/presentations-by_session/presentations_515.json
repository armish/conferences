[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Cancer staging can take essential time and expenses away from patients, both of which should be patients&#8217; management. In this current study, we aim to develop a machine learning-based early TNM staging model.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Normalized ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) counts data for melanoma patients was extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Six different experiments were run to produce machine learning algorithms for nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, combine (nodal or distant) metastasis, and higher vs lower tumor stage (T4\/T3 vs T2\/T1\/Tis). All datasets were split using 80\/20 for training and test sets. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to address the imbalanced distribution of the outcome. The algorithm accuracies were determined by a percent of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive and negative: PPV and NPV), and area under the receiver-operator curve (AUROC).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The best model for nodal metastasis was a random forest classifier (RF) with targeted gene expression (TE) showed higher sensitivity (98), specificity (100), PPV (100), NPV (94), and AUROC (1.00, 95%CI 0.91-0.99). TE for distant metastasis with RF, showed sensitivity (0), specificity (100), PPV (0), NPV (100), and AUROC (1.00, 95%CI 0.91-1.00). While TE for combined metastasis (nodal or distant) staging algorithm; Nodal or Distant Metastasis (TE) RF, showed sensitivity (98), specificity (100), PPV (100), NPV (99), and AUROC (1.00, 95%CI 0.88-0.98). The tumor staging (DEG and predicting higher stage i.e stage 3 or higher) algorithm; Tumor Staging (TE) RF, showed sensitivity (100), specificity (100), PPV (100), NPV (100), and AUROC (1.00, 95%CI 0.69-0.89) (<i>Table 1<\/i>).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our machine learning models can predict tumor staging including higher vs lower stage tumor, nodal metastasis, and combined metastasis with high accuracy. However, these results need to be further validated.<br \/><b>Table 1<\/b>.

Stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment have been shown that they play an important role in cancer development, but how they are linked to patient prognosis, chemotherapy response, and immunotherapy resistance is not fully investigated yet. The present study sought to investigate the stroma composition in the tumor microenvironment by using spatial analysis and deep learning.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> We analyzed stroma composition in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from 4 patient cohorts: St. Mary (37 patients), Yonsei-1 (622 patients), Yonsei-2 (66 patients), and TCGA-STAD (359 patients). St. Mary was collected from St. Mary Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Yonsei-1 and Yonsei-2 were collected from Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Each WSI was tessellated into 256x256 um at 40X magnification and normalized using Macenko and Reinhard normalization methods to reduce the color variability of the stained tissue images. Two deep learning models (ResNet and U-Net) were used to create prediction models using Kather&#8217;s tumor dataset and a crowdsourcing stroma dataset. Models were trained over 100 epochs, using the Adam optimizer, 1e-4 learning rate, a binary loss function, and L2 regularization. Trained models were used to predict WSIs including tumor, stroma, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), Microsatellite instability. Spatial analysis was conducted by using Getis-Ord-Gi*, a local statistic that identifies a statistically significant hot-spot region by providing relatedness with its neighbors. Tumor hot-spot regions were computed based on z-scores in the predicted WSIs and used for understanding the spatial variation of cancer cells, recognizing statistically significant regions and their spatial relatedness.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In Yonsei-1, stroma composition was significantly higher in the chemotherapy high-risk group (p-value 2.9e-09). The proportion of stroma composition is significantly different with the risk groups (p-value 0.074). In TCGA-STAD, the proportion of stroma composition is significantly different with ACTA2 and Microsatellite instability (p-value 0.028). In St. Mary, Yonsei-1, and Yonsei-2, stroma composition was significantly higher in the immunotherapy treatment non-response group (p-value 0.001).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b>These findings suggest that stroma composition in the tumor microenvironment is strongly associated with patient prognosis, chemotherapy response, and immunotherapy resistance on stomach cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5119dabb-566c-4e7e-b4d7-4fab9728d662\/@o03B8ZPZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stroma,Immune cells,Tumor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17475"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanghoon Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isaiah Pressman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongming Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Hyun Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>.

In adult cancers, passenger mutations typically outnumber drivers by a hundred or thousand-fold; critically, the vast majority of passengers arise in the normal cell lineage that precedes the malignant transformation event and hence reflects mutational processes existing in the cancer's precursor cell and its ancestors.<br \/>Passenger mutations are not uniformly distributed across the genome, but are concentrated in areas of the genome that have a locally high mutation rate. Mutation rates are highest at places in the genome where chromatin is tightly packed and less accessible to the DNA repair machinery. Each distinct cell type has a different pattern of chromatin packing due to epigenetic modifications. DeepTumour takes advantage of this to infer the chromatin state in the cell of origin from the distribution of passenger mutations in the tumor.<br \/>Another characteristic of passenger mutations is that the probability of a particular type of mutation occurring (e.g. replacement of C by T) depends on the mutational processes that were active in the cell of origin and its ancestors. Because certain cancers are associated with distinct mutational exposures (e.g. lung cancer and smoking), DeepTumour uses the tumor's distribution of passenger mutation type as well as position on the genome.<br \/>The DeepTumour algorithm itself is a fully connected, feed-forward neural network which we trained using 28 cohorts representing different tumor types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project. When applied to independent sets of tumors, the algorithm is able to achieve an overall accuracy of 88% on primary tumors and 83% on metastatic tumors for distinguishing the 28 cancer types. Furthermore, DeepTumour provides estimates of the models uncertainty, allowing it to automatically detect rare cancer samples with an accuracy of 93%.<br \/>The DeepTumour algorithm is now available as a fast, convenient and secure web-based service at <u>https<\/u><u>:\/\/<\/u><u>deeptumour<\/u><u>.<\/u><u>oicr<\/u><u>.<\/u><u>on<\/u><u>.<\/u><u>ca<\/u>.

This can lower cost and false positives by reducing unnecessary exams and has the potential to find more cancers at a curable stage. Deep learning (DL) is a class of artificial intelligence algorithms that progressively extracts higher-level representations from raw input. A critical challenge to applying DL for BC risk prediction is that images are needed from exams performed before a possible cancer diagnosis. Large longitudinal datasets with cancer labeling are relatively scarce. Recently, new self-supervised methods have been developed which do not require labeling. Instead, they learn to recognize higher-level features by comparing two augmented images and determining if they are derived from the same original image.<br \/>Methods: We developed Self-supervised AI for CAncer Risk Assessment (SAICARA), a mammography-based DL model to predict BC risk. We trained SAICARA on mammograms from the Chicago Multiethnic Epidemiologic Cohort (ChiMEC). We used the momentum contrast method in pretraining to train an encoder that produces compact representations of input mammography views. We initialized the encoders with weights obtained from training on the ImageNet dataset. We continued pretraining with 223,415 chest radiographs from the CheXpert database. Finally, we used mammograms from ChiMEC without any requirements on the exam date. We used augmentations from two different mammography views to provide better positive pairs for self-supervised learning. For fine-tuning, we trained with exams from women who were known to be cancer-free with at least 100 days of follow-up, and patients diagnosed with BC at least 30 days following the exam. Optimization was performed using a negative-log likelihood loss function which was discretized by considering quantiles of the event-time distribution. Hyperparameters were tuned using a Bayesian optimization strategy implemented by Weights and Biases. We computed the concordance index and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) at two years to evaluate the discriminating capacity of the predicted risk of BC. We evaluated our model using 10-fold cross-validation.<br \/>Results: In the final phase of pretraining, we used 13,194 mammography exams from 2,835 women. For fine-tuning, we used 4,849 exams from 1,418 women who were known to be cancer-free at their last follow-up, and 1,760 exams from 744 women who had exams that were followed by a BC diagnosis. SAICARA achieved a mean concordance index of 0.62 (standard deviation, SD = 0.11) and a mean AUC of 0.61 (SD = 0.09).<br \/>Conclusion: Self-supervised DL holds promise as a technique for improving the performance of image-based BC risk prediction models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd797047-b9d8-40be-8eaf-69e2a4726263\/@p03B8ZQ1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Deep learning,Screening,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17478"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Woodard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olasubomi J.

EGFR mutations can occur in various subtypes, such as Exon19 deletion, and L858R substitution, which are important for early therapy decisions. Here, we propose a deep learning approach for detecting and classifying EGFR mutation subtypes, which will greatly reduce the cost of determining mutation status, allowing for testing in a low resource setting.<br \/>Methods: An EfficientNet-B0 model was trained with whole slide images of lung tissue or metastatic lymph nodes with known EGFR mutation subtype (wild type, exon19 deletion or L858R substitution). Regions of interest were tiled into 512x512 pixel images. The RGB .jpeg tiles are augmented by rotating 90&#8304;, 180&#8304;, 270&#8304;, and mirroring.

While antibodies against a single target, such as CD40 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and PD1 on T cells, are widely used in clinic to treat various forms of cancer, bispecific antibodies are still in the early stages of clinical development. The aim of this study was to predict pharmacokinetics (PK), receptor occupancy (RO) and optimal dose for a bispecific antibody YH008 against CD40 and PD1 using the PBPK\/RO model.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The PBPK\/RO model describes distribution of an antibody (mAb) between physiological compartments, transport across the endothelium, binding with CD40 on dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, and macrophages (Mph) and PD1 on CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the immunological synapses (ISs). The model takes into account number of cells expressing target molecules and their ligands, expression levels, clearance of the antibody. Two scenarios of mAb binding with CD40 were considered: a case when the mAb competes with CD40L for the binding site and a case when the mAb binds to a different site. Binding affinities of YH008 for human CD40 and PD1 were taken from [1]. The model was validated using PK data on monospecific antibodies against CD40 and PD1. ROs of PD1 on CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and CD40 for Mph, DCs, B cells and percentages of the trimer complex (CD40-YH008-PD1) were calculated. Optimal dose of YH008 was selected on the basis of maximal exposure\/area under curve (AUC) of the trimers in ISs between APCs and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the tumor.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Model simulations show good agreement with the experimental PK and RO data for monospecific mAbs against PD1 (Pembrolizumab) and CD40 (Selicrelumab, BI 655064). For the bispecific antibody, the simulations show that competition for the CD40 binding site between CD40L and the mAb does not significantly affect PK and RO in blood or tissue. The model predicts 99% RO on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and 98% RO on T cells in blood at dose 80 mg. In the tumor, 95% RO on APCs and 85% RO on T cells, as well as 5-to-6-fold decrease in the number of PD1-PDL1 complexes in ISs, are achieved at dose 240 mg. The dose dependence for YH008 was calculated, and the optimal dose based on the numbers of the trimers and signaling complexes in the ISs was estimated.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The PBPK\/RO model for a bispecific mAb based on physiological levels of immune cells, target molecule expression, and binding parameters for YH008 antibody against CD40 and PD1 predicts PK and RO in peripheral blood and tumor. The model shows that competition for CD40 binding site between the mAb and CD40L does not significantly affect PK and RO.

Previously, we established a murine model of human HER2+ breast cancer, and investigated whether the sequence in which two drugs are delivered affected the treatment outcome [1]. However, this combination therapy can cause cardiac toxicity. While the cardiac damage induced by trastuzumab does not appear to be dose dependent and it is reversible, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is cumulative, dose dependent, and irreversible. Thus, rigorously identifying a treatment protocol that simultaneously maintains tumor control and reduces the total dose of doxorubicin, would potentially decrease the side effects experienced by patients receiving these treatments, while maintaining high treatment efficacy.<br \/>We propose a complete framework for model development, calibration, selection, and treatment optimization to find the optimal treatment protocol for HER2+ breast cancer using a trastuzumab-doxorubicin combination. To do so, we constructed a family of ten mathematical models designed to characterize the dynamics of tumor growth and treatment response. In particular, the models included tumor-drug and drug-drug interactions. Using a Bayesian framework, each of these models were calibrated to the data obtained in [1], and the most parsimonious model as determined by the Bayesian information criterion was selected to represent the system. We then applied optimal control theory (while considering uncertainty in the model parameters) to systematically identify the optimal treatment protocol using the selected model. We had two major findings. First, we kept the total dose of both drugs fixed to that which was employed in the experiments in [1], and identified a treatment schema where the tumors showed complete regression without increasing the overall amount of therapy. Then, we found the treatment schema with the least amount of drug delivered (decreased by 58%) that resulted in the same tumor kinetics as the experimental results.<br \/>Thus, we employed mathematical modeling and an <i>in vivo<\/i> model of breast cancer to rigorously and systematically identify treatment protocols that can improve tumor control with the same total dose, or achieve the same tumor control with less than half the doxorubicin dose. Predictions can now be tested experimentally. This has a significant impact for the design of combination therapy for HER2+ breast cancer.<br \/>[1] Sorace, A.G., Quarles, C.C., Whisenant, J.G., Hanker, A.B., McIntyre, J.O., Sanchez, V.M. and Yankeelov, T.E., 2016.

Additional tests such as ultrasound and biopsy might be needed to decide results. Setting aside the improvements in classifying breast mass Mg images via deep learning (DL), obtaining large training data and ensuring generalizations across different datasets with robust and well-optimized algorithms is a challenge. ImageNet based transfer learning has been utilized to address the unavailability of large datasets and robust algorithms. However, it is yet to achieve the desired accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for DL models to be used as a standalone tool. Furthermore, previous works are computationally infeasible where exhaustive patch separation is carried out to segment the region of interest before training, which makes processing computationally complex and time-consuming. Here we propose a novel deep learning method based on multistage transfer learning from ImageNet and cancer cell line images pre-trained EfficientNetB2 model to classify mammographic breast mass as either benign or malignant.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We trained our model on three publicly available datasets, 13,128 Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), 7632 INbreast, and 3816 Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) Mg breast mass images. Additionally, we trained our model on a mixed dataset of images from the three datasets to evaluate robustness. Data were sorted into 6:2:2 ratio for training, validation, and test, respectively. The microscopic cancer cell line dataset size was 38, 080 images.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We obtained an average 5-fold cross-validation AUC of 0.9999, test accuracy of 99.99%, sensitivity of 1, and specificity of 0.9998 on DDSM, AUC of 0.9997, test accuracy of 99.99%, sensitivity of 0.9972, and specificity of 0.9988 on INbreast, and AUC of 0.9987, test accuracy of 99.89%, sensitivity of 0.9987, specificity of 1 on MIAS, and AUC of 0.9997, test accuracy of 99.91%, sensitivity of 0.9993, and specificity of 0.9989 on the mixed dataset. Moreover, we acquired a P-value of 0.019 in the investigation of a statistically significant improvement in test accuracy from using our method compared to the conventional ImageNet based transfer learning on DDSM dataset.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study suggests that utilizing cancer cell line images further improved the learning process alleviating the need for large Mg training data.

Here, we developed a proprietary AI-based multimodal approach to integrate clinical, digitized hematoxylin-eosin (H&#38;E), and radiology bone scan (rBS) data for outcome prediction in ADT-treated nmCRPC patients. Identifying prostate cancer patients who may not benefit from ADT could improve the medical management of this disease beyond current definitive therapy.<br \/>Methods: Patients in the ADT+placebo arm from SPARTAN clinical trial on nmCRPC with available clinical, H&#38;E, and rBS were used (n=154). These patients were randomly divided into 70% (n=107) discovery and 30% (n=47) hold-out test datasets. Using the discovery set, we developed and trained a multimodal approach that combines survival convolutional neural networks (SCNNs1) and Cox proportional-hazards model (CPH) to learn ADT outcomes for overall survival (OS) and time to PSA progression (TTP) from the integration of imaging data and 11 traditional clinical features (e.g., tumor stage, Gleason score, PSA). The ability of the trained framework in predicting outcomes and risk stratification was evaluated on the hold-out set. Bootstrap analysis with Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine the significance of the multimodal framework&#8217;s performance improvement compared to clinical CPH.<br \/>Results: The multimodal framework was predictive of ADT outcomes for OS and TTP in nmCRPC patients. In SPARTAN&#8217;s hold-out set, the multimodal framework significantly improved the predictive power of clinical CPH by 14%&#8212;16% across both outcomes (Wilcoxon signed rank P&#60;0.0001). In particular, the multimodal framework&#8217;s concordance index (c-index) was 0.72 for OS and 0.73 for TTP, while clinical CPH&#8217;s c-index was 0.62 for OS, and 0.64 for TTP. Further, multimodal framework significantly stratified high- from low-risk nmCRPC patients for OS and TTP (log-rank P= 0.0049-0.0072), while clinical CPH failed to stratify risk for OS (log-rank P= 0.2891).<br \/>Conclusion: AI-based framework that learns from the integration of different data types improves outcome prediction in ADT-treated nmCRPC. The multimodal approach demonstrates promise in treatment decision support for the early use of androgen receptor-directed therapy and patient selection for clinical trials with novel treatment combinations.<br \/>Reference:<br \/>1.

In general, the approximate size of the tumor is considered in pathologic staging, but it is not known whether the exact size of the infiltrative cancer area is related to the patients' survival. To analyze the effectiveness of the size of the infiltrative cancer area for survival analysis of patients, we developed a machine learning algorithm that predicts death risk by analyzing clinical data and the actual size of the infiltrative cancer area from hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images (WSIs) of breast cancer.<br \/>Design: To obtain an area of infiltrative cancer, an experienced pathologist conducted annotations using WSIs of breast cancer resection tissue. The data analyzed in this study was from The Cancer Genome Atlas&#8217;s breast cancer data set (TCGA-BRCA). There were 871 WSIs labeled with survival events and periods, and several clinical features according to patients including the age at diagnosis, ER, PR, HER2 status, and pathologic TNM stages. We extract the size of the infiltrative cancer area from annotations and incorporate them with clinical features. There existed 53 uncensored data, and we splitted the whole dataset into 8:2 for training\/validation. We performed 5-fold cross validation with random sampling. We trained a Cox Regression model with features and compared C-index according to features.<br \/>Result: The C-index with the infiltrative cancer area for the test set was 0.806. This figure is an improvement of 0.2 from 0.781 without the infiltrative cancer area. The hazard ratio of the infiltrative cancer area was 1.84. The p-value of the infiltrative cancer area was 0.019 for the log-rank test.<br \/>Conclusion: This result shows that the infiltrative cancer area is a useful feature even in the presence of the TNM stage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/640c1e3d-106d-4dd8-af6a-8a4bea8bd300\/@p03B8ZQ1\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Survival,Machine learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18432"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>JunYoung Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae-Yeong Kwak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Woo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyeyoon Chang<\/i><\/presenter>.

The wide spectrum of growth patterns proves challenging for reproducible and quantitative scoring. Currently, scoring is based on manual identification of the predominant pattern and percentages of patterns in routine diagnostic slides. The lack of an automated method also limits our ability to investigate the immune microenvironment of growth patterns.<br \/>To overcome the above challenges, we present a deep learning method, Pyramid Stream Networks, to precisely segment growth patterns at pixel level. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method captures different spatial scales of the histology information by novel attention strategies at different learning stages. This problem-oriented design yields precise boundaries for each pattern, enabling the investigation of growth pattern heterogeneity, and the relationship with tumor microenvironment components.<br \/>Experiments were conducted on 49 haematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from TRACERx 100 cohort (AbdulJabbar et al., 2020). Each WSI was sparsely annotated by 3 senior pathologists. A total of 2968 annotated patches were split into 5 folds for cross validation. We compared our method with two state-of-the-art methods applied in semantic segmentation, attention U-net (Oktay et al. 2018) and DeepLabV3+ (Chen et al. 2018). When evaluated at patch level, our method outperformed the better comparison method, DeepLabV3+, by 3.43% and 2.99% in pixel-wise Dice and overall precision (OP) (Dice: 60.34% vs. 56,91%, OP: 65.43% vs. 62.44%). When applied to WSIs, the model correctly predicted the predominant pattern for 38 out of 49 samples, achieving an accuracy of 77.55%. Interestingly, in the 11 discordant cases, 10 showed high intra-tumor heterogeneity of growth patterns, measured by Shannon diversity, highlighting the impact of intra-tumor heterogeneity on growth pattern assessment. Additionally, we combined the identified growth patterns with lymphocytic distribution measured in (AbdulJabbar et al., 2020) and revealed a significantly increased immune infiltration in proximity to the solid pattern as compared to others, which is in line with previous findings (Tavernari et al., 2021).<br \/>In summary, by leveraging image-analysis and artificial intelligence techniques, we propose a new method for precise growth pattern segmentation from routine histology samples of lung adenocarcinoma. It provides quantitative and reproducible scores of growth patterns, which can be developed into a decision support system for pathologists and clinicians. Furthermore, through pattern-specific spatial mapping, it enables future studies of intra-tumor heterogeneity, such as the preferential infiltration of lymphocyte subsets adjacent to diverse growth patterns.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b899290b-591a-4828-8d39-47bb24114773\/@p03B8ZQ1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Carcinoma: adenocarcinoma,Histopathology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18433"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaoxi Pan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanyun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anca-Ioana Grapa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khalid AbdulJabbar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shan E.

Due to the various artifacts present on frozen section tissue slides, it is difficult to automatically analyze them. We tried automatic analysis of frozen sections.<br \/>Two types of segmentation deep learning models detecting Gleason patterns were used. Both models were trained from hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) stained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate tissue slide images. Each slide image was reviewed by an experienced pathologist, and all prostate cancer lesions were annotated with corresponding Gleason grades. One model was trained with H&#38;E stained images (RS model), and the other model was trained with Hematoxylin-only (H-only) stained images (H-only model). A color deconvolution method was used to generate H-only stained images from original H&#38;E stained images.<br \/>In evaluation, frozen section prostate cancer slide images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used. To diagnose the slide, we splitted whole slide images (WSI) into patches and analyze those patches to segment the Gleason pattern area. For the WSI result, we reconstructed the result as a whole size heatmap, then we counted the Gleason pattern to diagnose the slide as the prostate grade group.<br \/>In detecting malignant cases, the RS model achieved a sensitivity of 98% and the H only model of 97%, respectively. In detecting clinically significant risk cases (grade group 2 or over), sensitivities of 99% and 96% were achieved, respectively. Most of the errors were all false-positive cases. In particular, the RS model mainly had false positives because of the ice crystal artifact, and the H-only model had many false positives for the folded part and the part suspected of being a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). False negatives were common in the compression artifacts for both models.<br \/>We confirmed that both models showed high performance in cancer detection. In addition, they showed high accuracy in the classification of high-risk and low-risk groups of cancer.

We conducted an experiment to find out whether there is a correlation between the RS value derived through genetic testing and specific morphological characteristics of breast cancer tissues with the expectation that these morphological features could predict RS values. Deep learning was utilized to assess the morphology of the hematoxylin-eosin (H&#38;E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) of breast cancer. In this study, we used 125 breast cancer cases associated with H&#38;E stained WSIs and RS scores which were divided into 3 risk groups based on the RS values: the low-risk group with 49 cases, the intermediate-risk group with 59 cases, and the high-risk group with 17 cases (low-risk for RS &#60; 18, high-risk for RS &#62; 31, and intermediate-risk for RS in between). On each WSI, an expert pathologist has annotated invasive breast tumor regions. We divided WSIs into 512x512 patches and trained a deep CNN model to classify the patches as benign (including DCIS), low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk. In determining the risk group of each WSI, all patches from the WSI were classified by the model first, and then their majority class was assigned to the WSI. A nested cross validation was adopted to evaluate how well the model generalizes. The performance of the algorithm is shown in Table 1. According to the results, our model was able to distinguish between the low-risk group and the high-risk group to some extent. In particular, there was no case of misclassifying the low-risk group as high-risk. Since these high-risk patients require radiological examination, there is an advantage that the 21-gene test is not required. Although our model has yielded modest results, we believe that future studies through the integration of additional data with other clinical and pathological data will yield better results.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{8E3DE20C-5DA5-47A4-8C4F-884667A303CC}\"><caption>Result Table<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-107d8fc1-7fff-22eb-934f-137df1264ccf\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;

Our pancreatic adenocarcinoma survival model and GAFE was trained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) stained whole slide images (WSIs). Also, to measure the generalization performance, we predict the death risk of rectum adenocarcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma using the pancreatic adenocarcinoma survival model.<br \/>Design: The whole data analyzed in this study was from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used a self-supervised contrastive learning method to train GAFE with randomly chosen 328 adenocarcinoma H&#38;E stained WSIs. These WSIs are consisted of 92 lung (TCGA-LUAD), 100 colon (TCGA-COAD), 97 prostate (TCGA-PRAD) and 39 stomach (TCGA-STAD) adenocarcinoma WSIs. For the pancreatic adenocarcinoma survival model, we used 179 WSIs of TCGA pancreatic adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PAAD) dataset labeled with survival events and periods. There existed 66 uncensored data, and we used 5-fold cross validation. Each WSI was divided into 256*256 pixel-wise patches. Feature vectors were extracted from the patches using the GAFE. Then the attention-based multi-instance learning was applied to train the survival model. The trained model returned a death risk for each patient. We used 122 adenocarcinoma H&#38;E stained WSIs of rectum (TCGA-READ) and 999 of breast (TCGA-BRCA) from TCGA to test the generalization performance for different organs.<br \/>Result: We used 5-fold cross validation for testing the pancreatic adenocarcinoma survival model. The mean value of C-index from the TCGA-PAAD test datasets was 0.7258 where the highest and the lowest C-index was 0.7784 and 0.6598. Using the model with median performance (C-index: 0.7216), we measured death risk and divided patients into 50% of high-risk and 50% of low-risk groups. From this, the p-value was 0.01986 for the log-rank test.To analyze the performance of the generalization, we ensembled 5 models from the above. We tested our ensembled model on TCGA-READ and TCGA-BRCA. The C-index for TCGA-Read was 0.6941 where the C-index for TCGA-BRCA was 0.5711.<br \/>Conclusion: We found that adenocarcinoma&#8217;s histomorphological features had some correlation with pancreatic adenocarcinoma survival prediction. Moreover, we could see the possibility of transferability of adenocarcinoma histomorphological knowledge and survival analysis to other organs such as rectum adenocarcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5238044d-8152-4360-b349-2f72127bcba7\/@q03B8ZQ2\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenocarcinoma,Pancreatic cancer,Survival,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18438"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joonho Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geongyu Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae-Yeong Kwak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Woo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyeyoon Chang<\/i><\/presenter>.

The heterogeneity in prostate cancer and the clinical significance of secondary tumors have been explored. However, studies to date have been limited to analyzing prostate biopsies or sections using dominant tumor foci only, not allowing for the evaluation of the inter and intra tumor molecular heterogeneity of the prostate cancer landscape. Recently, we identified mutually exclusive expression patterns of more than one driver molecular aberration in distinct tumor foci. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of tumors with distinct markers and correlate with clinical outcomes.<br \/>We developed a model to quantify cancerous regions and genotype expression on immunohistochemical (IHC) slides. Our algorithm combines multiple modeling strategies, including deep neural networks and color deconvolution. Dual ERG\/SPINK1 IHC staining was performed on whole mount prostatectomy slides.<br \/>Patches from corresponding slides stained with Hematoxylin\/eosin (H&#38;E) were generated to train the model. A color devolution method was used to separate the patches into H&#38;E and other stain channels. For evaluation, patches were generated from IHC slides, which were then transformed into Hematoxylin-only stained patches. Sample patches were analyzed for detection of cancerous regions at the pixel-level. The ratios of cancerous regions were calculated.<br \/>Our segmentation results were compared with the area positive for ERG or SPINK1. For the ERG stain, the model demonstrated a sensitivity of 62.72% per pixel, whereas it was associated with a sensitivity of 48.37% per pixel for SPINK1. This represents a robust performance for a proof-of-concept model, and sensitivities are expected to improve significantly with additional annotations. To investigate the entire landscape of whole mount samples, training to include recognition of morphological variations such as HGPIN is underway and expected to also increase sensitivity. More detailed analysis will be shared at the time of presentation.<br \/>We present here a quantitative analysis model that reveals unprecedented details on tumor heterogeneity with respect to molecular markers and tumor localization. To our knowledge, this is the first study on quantitative molecular mapping of cancer and biomarker expression using whole mount samples.<br \/>The marker expression in each tumor foci can be correlated with clinicopathologic findings. Different molecular subtypes presented with more than one driver molecular aberration in distinct tumor foci may be associated with distinct clinical outcomes such as biochemical recurrence or metastasis, allowing for predicting disease progression and targeted approaches for effective prostate cancer management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd5c7936-dd1b-477d-8bfb-863e61f452d4\/@q03B8ZQ2\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor heterogeneity,Deep learning,Molecular markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18439"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joonyoung Cho<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>In Hye Suh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae-Yeong Kwak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Woo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyeyoon Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nallasivam Palanisamy<\/i><\/presenter>.

Identifying synthetic lethal (SL) relationships between a gene pair, where loss of either of the participating genes has no effect on cancer cells, however simultaneous disruption of both genes leads to cancer cell death, can uncover major survival mechanisms and expose vulnerabilities within cancers. In spite of advances in CRISPR or RNAi based loss of function screening it is difficult to identify these gene interactions solely by experimentation due to the vast mutational landscape of cancers, inability of cell lines to capture clinically relevant mutations, and large number of possible SL gene combinations. Furthermore, large scale CRISPR\/RNAi screens are prone to false positive results, leading to erroneous identification of gene interactions. We developed a machine learning model to identify SL genetic interactions by integrating pathway, ontology, genomic, and loss of function features on all gene pairs. This included features, which have been shown to be predictive of SL pairs such as, involvement in important cancer hallmark processes or signaling pathways, co-expression profile in patient cancers, and many more. The model was trained using SL pairs from published large scale experimental screens across several cancer types, ultimately enabling the prediction of cancer agnostic SL pairs. Non-SL pairs had to be computationally defined using post-perturbation gene expression profiles due to the lack of published data annotating non-SL pairs. The model showed significant predictive performance (AUROC = 0.94, AUPRC = 0.93, Specificity = 0.91), additionally, when tested on a gold standard, biologically verified set of SL gene pairs across several cancer types, the model showed good generalizability. We leveraged the model to identify key clinically relevant SL relationships and uncover complementary mechanisms tied to pro-survival processes. By identifying SL gene interacting pairs, our platform can help gain a better understanding of dominant mechanisms driving cancers and guide the discovery of novel therapies, biomarkers, and combination therapies early on during drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c88f5e78-07e9-4706-b109-d61ea4303c93\/@q03B8ZQ2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Machine learning,Drug discovery,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18440"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mukti Parikh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuel García-Quismondo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neel S.

A large part of these toxicity effects can be explained by a drug&#8217;s molecular target, known off targets or a drug&#8217;s lack of specificity. Therefore, the understanding of a target&#8217;s potential toxicity is crucial in the drug development process, potentially informing therapeutic hypotheses and\/or chemical design. Here, we introduce a machine learning model to predict a gene&#8217;s likelihood to result in patient toxicity when inhibited, independent of chemical compound information. We used information on drug approvals, discontinuations and withdrawals from the FDA to define &#8220;toxic&#8221; and &#8220;safe&#8221; targets, to be used as training data. Our model leveraged preclinical, gene-specific features that can be easily collected such as tissue expression, pathway involvement, and loss of function data, and achieves significant predictive performance (ROC = 0.80). We validated our model&#8217;s ability to discriminate between successful and unsuccessful drug candidates based on their predicted target toxicity. Furthermore, our model was able to predict differences in toxicity between gene isoforms, which were in agreement with published in vivo evidence, further highlighting its ability to be applied to guide drug development and lead optimization. By applying our model, the prediction of target-specific toxicity can guide drug screenings, prioritize candidates and avoid costly and dangerous drug failures.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7796c2f8-9f66-417f-96b3-6cdb92449474\/@q03B8ZQ2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Drug discovery,Toxicity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18441"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manuel Garcia-Quismondo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mukti Parikh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neel Madhukar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Coryandar Gilvary<\/i><\/presenter>.

In AS, patients are closely monitored <i>via<\/i> multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), prostate-specific antigen tests, and biopsies until these reveal an increase in PCa risk that warrants treatment. Thus, AS can contribute to reduce the current overtreatment of PCa and avoid treatment side-effects that may adversely impact patients&#8217; lives without necessarily improving their longevity. However, current AS protocols rely on assessing PCa according to population-based studies, which complicates the design of personalized monitoring plans and the early detection of tumor progression. To address these issues, we propose to predict PCa growth using patient-specific forecasts based on an mpMRI-informed mechanistic model.<br \/>Here, we present a preliminary study in a cohort of seven PCa patients who enrolled in AS and had three mpMRI scans over a period of 1.4 to 4.9 years. Our mechanistic model describes PCa growth in terms of tumor cell density dynamics, consisting of mobility and proliferation modeled <i>via<\/i> a diffusion process and a logistic law, respectively. We segment each patient&#8217;s prostate geometry on T2-weighted images and estimate tumor cell density from standard apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. To facilitate PCa modeling, we co-register each patient&#8217;s mpMRI datasets with a biomechanical elastic method that aligns the prostate segmentations across the imaging datasets. The model is initialized with the data from the first mpMRI scan. Model calibration relies on a nonlinear least-squares algorithm that minimizes the mismatch between ADC-measured and model-predicted tumor cell density at the second mpMRI date. For validation, we initialize the patient-specific calibrated model with the second mpMRI dataset and forecast PCa growth at the third mpMRI date, which we compare to the corresponding ADC-estimated tumor cell density.<br \/>Model calibration resulted in a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) &#38;gt; 0.99 for both tumor volume and global tumor cell count across the cohort. For each patient, the spatial fit of tumor cell density at the second scan date rendered a median Dice score and CCC of 0.79 and 0.52, respectively. Model validation resulted in CCCs of 0.88 and 0.81 for tumor volume and global tumor cell count across the cohort. Comparing the patient-specific ADC-estimated and model forecasts of tumor cell density at the third scan date, we obtained a median Dice score and CCC of 0.65 and 0.46, respectively. Thus, while improvement and further testing in larger cohorts are still needed, these results do suggest that our computational forecasting approach is a promising technology to predict the spatiotemporal growth of PCa during AS on a patient-specific basis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f611b151-28d1-4414-80e9-46b22531ae02\/@q03B8ZQ2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Mechanistic modeling,Magnetic resonance imaging,Mathematical oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18442"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guillermo Lorenzo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jon S.

This mathematical model represents AML evolution from health to disease as a state-transition of the transcriptome represented as a particle undergoing Brownian motion in a double-well quasi-potential, where critical points define states of perturbed hematopoiesis (c1), transition to AML (c2), and overt AML (c3). We successfully demonstrated that the state transition model predicted AML onset. We now test the applicability of AML state-transition model to predict disease response to chemotherapy. To this end, we performed a time-series experiment using the conditional Cbfb-MYH11 (CM) knock-in (Cbfb+\/56M\/Mx1Cre) mouse model recapitulating inv(16) AML. CM leukemic mice were treated with a combination of cytarabine (50mg\/kg\/day; 5 days) and daunorubicin (1.5mg\/kg\/day, 3 days) after detection of overt leukemia which is monitored by circulating leukemia blast (cKit+ &#62; 20%) to model the 7+3 standard of care treatment for newly diagnosed AML. A total of 110 peripheral blood samples from 7 CM mice were collected weekly before, during, and following chemotherapy and subjected to RNA-sequencing. The singular value decomposition was used to construct the transcriptome state-space and identified dynamics of AML (c3) after administration of chemotherapy treatment. Gene expression profiles following treatment revealed dynamics consistent with the state-transition model, with the transcriptome particle moving from leukemia (c3) towards a state of perturbed hematopoiesis (c1), before eventual relapse, re-crossing the transition point (c2) back to overt AML (c3). All 7 CM mice achieved a partial response, defined as the transcriptome particle crossing the c2 critical point, with a mean time to relapse of 5 weeks, defined as the time of the first observation after the particle crosses back over c2 towards the leukemic state c3. Mean arrival time analysis was used to accurately predict the extent of response, defined by the transcriptome particle in the state-space, and the time to relapse. We successfully applied state-transition mathematical model to predict treatment response and the time to relapse in all CM mice, confirming the applicability of the model to post-chemo therapy disease dynamics. This predictive model has implications to improve therapeutic strategies by targeting transcriptome state-transition critical points in human AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5915bdac-5573-45b8-9134-d9583340bf0d\/@q03B8ZQ2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription,Multiomics,Acute myeloid leukemia,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18443"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lisa Uechi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergio Branciamore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David E.

Current methodology generally relies on detection of multiple low-VAF (variant allele fraction) co-mutations. At low TC and low DNA input (&#60;30ng, 9,000 genome equivalents), many variant sites are not expected to have any tumor-derived fragments or will be only marginally above background noise. A method that does not rely on the positive identification of mutations would be useful for detecting early disease recurrence.<br \/>Methods We developed a maximum likelihood (ML) method for inferring the TC of MRD samples, rather than VAF at individual sites. This method considers the frequency of non-reference reads at each variant site along with estimated error rates. To evaluate our method at low TC, we carried out spike-in simulations of MRD samples across a range of sample TC from 0 to 0.1%. For each simulation, we randomly selected a single normal from a pool of sequenced normal samples to serve as background. Using this background, we randomly selected sites and mutations to represent somatic variants, sampled the existing noise at each site, and the number of ctDNA fragments and reads given the tumor content. Intrinsic error rates were modeled as either the mean error of the sample, the per-reference base error, or the mutation error. An additional randomly selected normal sample was used for extrinsic, per-site error estimates. We created contrived tumor-informed MRD samples by serial two-fold dilution of tumor DNA in a normal background (0.2%-0.0125% sample TC), followed by amplicon sequencing and characterization by our ML method.<br \/>Results In our spike-in simulations, using 32 variants sites, we achieved 99% sensitivity in detecting tumor sequence at a TC of 0.01% (average ~1 tumor fragment per site), 73% sensitivity at 0.005% (average ~0.5 tumor fragments per site), and 99.9% specificity when using extrinsic error from a normal sample. At 16 sites we achieved 95% and 68% sensitivity respectively, and 99.6% specificity. Without the extrinsic error, specificity was greatly reduced to 71% (16 sites) and 77% (32 sites) at .005% TC. This highlights the advantage of extrinsic error in estimating low TC. In our contrived samples, we found that TC estimates from our ML approach correlated well with the expected values (r = 0.99).<br \/>Conclusions With our approach, we were able to accurately quantify TC in both simulated and contrived samples. In simulated samples, we can detect TC well below 0.01% with high specificity and using only 16 sites. Importantly, the TC estimation does not rely on identifying individual positive sites. While modeling the intrinsic sequencing error rates in a sample does increase our ability to characterize TC, extrinsic, per-site error rates are needed to control false positives introduced by constitutively noisy sites.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/499e1156-197e-446e-983c-1f17cf16642b\/@r03B8ZQ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Recurrence,MRD,Bioinformatics,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18444"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew Conley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huazhang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex V.

However, no studies have coupled immune phenotypes classified by spatial analysis of TIL in whole slide images (WSI) with TGF-B pathway analysis on a large-scale database. Here, we hypothesized that the immune-excluded phenotype classified by a deep-learning spatial analysis model, Lunit SCOPE IO, would be correlated with the aberrant TGF-B pathway in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. Aberrant TGF-B pathway was measured by Trimmed Mean of <i>M<\/i>-values (TMM) normalized and transformed to log2 of counts-per-million of previously published gene sets of fibroblast-specific TGF-beta responsive gene signature, using edgeR packages from TCGA RNA-sequencing data (n=6,709) across the 23 cancer types. Lunit SCOPE IO was developed to identify immune phenotypes trained and validated from 3,166 multi-cancer H&#38;E WSI with sections of 2.8e+9 mm<sup>2<\/sup> tumor tissue containing 5.9e+6 TIL annotated by 52 board-certified pathologists. Lunit SCOPE IO classified immune phenotypes as immune-inflamed and -excluded according to the proportion of TIL density either highly conserved in cancer epithelium (CE) or cancer stroma (CS), respectively, and otherwise, classified as immune-desert with low TIL density in CE and CS. Aberrant TGF-B expression was highly enriched in multiple cancer types including pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer, kidney clear cell carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and breast cancer, in ascending order. TGF-B expression was increased in microsatellite-stable tumor samples (p = 7.4e-15) or samples with low tumor mutational burden (TMB, &#60; 10\/megabase, p = 4.9e-8), compared to those with microsatellite instability-high or high TMB, respectively. Interestingly, TGF-B expression was highly correlated with the proportion of cancer stroma in WSI (R = 0.315, p &#60; 2.2e-16) and the proportion of immune-excluded phenotype (R = 0.115, p &#60; 2.2e-16) across multiple cancer types. Tumor samples with SMAD4 mutations (n = 161, 2.4%) had significantly higher TGF-B expression (p = 0.0190), and a higher proportion of immune-excluded phenotype (p &#60; 2.2e-16) in WSI, compared to wild-type SMAD4. Aberrant TGF-B pathway is clearly associated with increased proportion of cancer stroma, and excluded TIL, or immune-excluded phenotype in a large-scale pan-carcinoma analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f7148975-f6e7-4795-8a81-5aa2bf6aedec\/@r03B8ZQ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,TGF-&#946;,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19005"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gahee Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanghoon Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyung-Gyo Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soo Ick Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wonkyung Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, Lunit AI team, <presenter><i>Sergio Pereira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donggeun Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyunghyun Paeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chan-Young Ock<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, radioresistance emerges and a cure is not always achieved. To date, researchers have studied T-cells and lymphocytes to understand response to RT, but little is known about myeloid cells. This diverse group of cells helps mount immunological responses, but can also be immunosuppressive by lessening the strength of T-cells. We hypothesized that our network-based analyses of single cell proteogenomic data generated from tumor-infiltrating immune cells can identify druggable proteins in pathways driving unwanted immunosuppressive changes, particularly among myeloid cells.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Proteogenomic (CITE-Seq) analysis was conducted on CD45+ immune cells from unirradiated and irradiated orthotopic 4T1 murine mammary tumors three- and ten-days after tumor irradiation. Based on select proteins&#8217; surface expression, CITE-Seq generated eight distinct clusters, including three myeloid cell clusters &#8212; monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. We used VIPER (virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon analysis), a machine learning-based algorithm that infers protein activities by taking regulatory gene expression networks and calculating the weighted expression on each protein&#8217;s targets, to create functional subclusters of the eight immune-cell populations. For subclusters enriched by RT, we used OncoTreat to identify active, druggable proteins.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Lymphocytes were depleted with radiation, especially ten days post-irradiation. While monocytes appeared homogeneous, one of three subclusters of macrophages appeared more resistant (i.e. enriched with radiation) and had 4 druggable targets (PSMA4, HSP90AB1, PARP1, APEX1) from OncoTreat. Similarly, three of eight subclusters of granulocytes appeared resistant, with two potential targets (PSMA4, S100A9).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Suppressive populations were identified among the immune cells, specifically myeloid cells. We plan to experimentally test whether drugging the aforementioned targets in macrophages and granulocytes improves the overall efficacy of RT by augmenting an anti-tumor immune response.<br \/><b>Affiliations: Aparna Krishnan<\/b><b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aleksandar Obradovic<\/b><b><sup>1<\/sup>, Catherine Spina<\/b><b><sup>2<\/sup>, Andrea Califano<\/b><b><sup>1,3,4,5,6<\/sup><\/b><br \/><sup>1 <\/sup>Department of Systems Biology*<sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>2 <\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology*<sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>3 <\/sup>Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center*<sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>4 <\/sup>Department of Medicine*<sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>5 <\/sup>Department of Biochemistry &#38; Molecular Biophysics*<sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>6 <\/sup>Department of Biomedical Informatics*<br \/>* Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7bae1399-05a1-4a1c-9c32-f2aa2195e837\/@r03B8ZQ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Network biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Radiation therapy,RNA sequencing,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19006"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aparna Krishnan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksander Obradovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Spina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Califano<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have previously shown that morphological alterations in axillary lymph nodes (LNs), namely the formation of germinal centers in cancer-free LNs, adds prognostic value to TILs in triple negative breast cancer patients (TNBC) for the development of distant metastasis. Extending manual assessment of LNs beyond the detection of cancer requires the integration of robust deep learning pipelines into the digital pathology workflow. In this retrospective study, we used 1,100 Haematoxylin &#38; Eosin-stained (H&#38;E) Whole Slide Images (WSI) from Guy&#8217;s Hospital (London, UK) of metastatic and cancer-free LNs from 151 patients (100 N+) enriched for triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer to implement a supervised deep learning pipeline. A subset of 114 WSI, along with 5 breast cancer LN WSIs from each of Barts Hospital (London, UK) and Tianjin University Hospital (Tianjin, China), and 5 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas LN WSI (Guy&#8217;s Hospital) were used to develop, train and evaluate the segmentation task. For training Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), WSIs manually annotated for both germinal centers and sinuses formed a ground-truth set. Three FCNs were implemented: (i) a standard U-Net architecture; (ii) a U-Net model with an attention gate mechanism; and (iii) a multiscale-U-Net network (MSA-U-Net) that encodes, in parallel, a feature representation of the image at multiple resolutions. The MSA-U-Net achieved the best performance with an average dice score of 0.85 for germinal centers and 0.75 for sinuses. In comparison, the average dice score amongst 4 pathologists assessing 25 LN WSI for germinal centers and sinuses, was 0.67 and 0.61 respectively, demonstrating the robustness of the MSA-U-Net model. To quantify germinal centers and sinuses in LNs across the entire cohort, the trained MSA-U-Net was used in an inference step on all 1,100 WSI. The detected morphological features were initially localized within LNs using image thresholding and contouring techniques, and quantitatively assessed based on their number, area, shape, and Shannon diversity. We found significant morphological differences in metastatic and cancer-free LNs between N0 and N+ patients, with the latter displaying larger germinal centers with more irregular shapes especially in their metastatic LNs. In addition, we found differences in the Sinus area between LNs containing GCs and those without. Here, we propose a robust deep learning pipeline based on a multiscale FCN framework to automatically detect, localize and quantify histopathological immune features in WSI of LNs. By applying our pipeline to LNs of cancer patients, such as breast or head and neck, in prospective studies or clinical trials, we will further evaluate their prognostic and predictive values.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e3f11c0-23c8-4424-ab2d-41138aa31db4\/@r03B8ZQ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Deep learning,Lymph nodes,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19947"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"30623500-f020-4b8f-8813-f8a4981858d7","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30623500-f020-4b8f-8813-f8a4981858d7\/@r03B8ZQ3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gregory Verghese<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengyuan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amit Lohan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikhil Cherian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swapnil Rane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fangfang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aekta Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pat Gazinska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Selvam Thavaraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amit Sethi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anita Grigoriadis<\/i><\/presenter>.

Prediction of pathological stages of cancer can play a critical role in early diagnosis and personalized medicine. This project ventures into the prediction of different stages of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using prioritized DNA methylation patterns. DNA methylation profiles for each HNSCC stage (stage-I-IV) were used to extensively analyze 485,577 methylation CpG sites and prioritize them on the basis of the highest predictive power using a wrapper-based feature selection method, along with different classification models. We identified 68 high-power methylation sites which predicted the pathological stage of HNSCC samples with 90.62 % accuracy using a Random Forest classifier. We set out to construct a protein-protein interaction network for the proteins encoded by the 67 genes associated with these sites to study its network topology and also undertook enrichment analysis of nodes in their immediate neighborhood for GO and KEGG Pathway annotations revealing their role in cancer-related pathways, cell differentiation, signal transduction, metabolic and biosynthetic processes. With information on the predictive power of each of the 67 genes in each HNSCC stage, we unveil a dynamic stage-course network for HNSCC that evolves over the course of the four cancer stages. We intend to further study these genes in light of functional datasets from CRISPR, RNAi, drug screens for their putative role in HNSCC initiation and\/or progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/217eca47-c396-4517-a167-1d572871bbd6\/@r03B8ZQ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Network biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Methylation,Progression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21349"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"77ce83c4-26df-439d-b7f8-bed6f0364102","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/77ce83c4-26df-439d-b7f8-bed6f0364102\/@r03B8ZQ3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arsalan Riaz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faisal Khan<\/i><\/presenter>.

HPV infection specifically the subtype HPV16 is a significant risk factor in the initiation and progression of OPSCC, more prevalent in the western part of the world. This study carries out a computational analysis using protein interactions between HPV16 proteins and protein products of key OPSCC and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) cancer genes, which aims to investigate the influence of HPV16 on OPSCC and OSCC in terms of protein-protein interactions (PPIs).We created a protein interaction network of HPV16 and human proteins followed by retrieval of mutated genes in OPSCC and OSCC from online databases including COSMIC, cBioPortal and the GDC Portal, along with literature mining. We used MCODE and ClueGo tools for cluster and enrichment analysis, respectively. Drug candidates against the common interacted proteins were found using drug databases like PanDrugs and CLUE Repurposing. After annotating the HPV16-Human PPI network with proteins encoded by genes found to be mutated in both cancers, 31 proteins in OPSCC and 17 proteins in OSCC were in direct interaction with the viral proteins especially, E5, E6, and E7. The immediate network (of first neighbors only) appeared to be sparse, but after looking at the broader HPV16-Human network we found 5 highly connected modules, 4 of which were dominated by proteins encoded by genes mutated in OPSCC as compared to OSCC, indicating the influence of HPV16 on OPSCC. Based on module integrity and topological characteristics we identified 4 significant candidates for HPV16-driven OPSCC i.e. MYC, CREBBP, PML, and RB1 which are significantly enriched in cancer pathways. In the South Asian countries, Epstein Bar Virus type 1 (EBV-1) is a more prevalent risk factor for virus-driven Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) as compared to HPV-16, however, knowledge regarding the EBV induced OPSCC and OSCC is scarce. We created a protein interaction network for EBV1 and Human proteins to analyze the topological characteristics especially of proteins encoded by genes mutated in HNSCC using the same methodology and we identified 5 candidate proteins i.e. EP300, CUL3, RB1, DDB1, and CREBBP for further <i>in vitro<\/i> validation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c6f6f339-a2ad-473b-bd35-daa60d3e8825\/@r03B8ZQ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Network biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein-protein interactions,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21350"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"e5ff1bda-4ef7-464c-a0f9-980bf47260aa","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e5ff1bda-4ef7-464c-a0f9-980bf47260aa\/@r03B8ZQ3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Arsalan Riaz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yusra Ilyas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faisal Khan<\/i><\/presenter>.

On the other hand, deep learning tools that employ high-resolution whole slide images and therefore substantially greater compute power and are not easily accessible in low-resource settings. In this study we train and test deep learning models using low-resolution and low-cost digital histopathology images acquired using a 5-megapixel Leica ICC50 camera mounted on a Leica DM500 binocular microscope, at two different magnification levels, Under IRB approvals, we acquired a total of 64 Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&#38;E) stained tissue slides of biopsies taken from patient presenting at Rehman Medical Institute from 2016 to 2020 that were anonymized. A total of 2370 images were captured at two different magnification levels, i.e. 10x and 40x, and were labelled with four classes by at least one expert pathologist (677 well differentiated, 1066 moderately differentiated, 152 poor differentiated and 475 normal) to develop the ESCC image dataset. Preprocessing was performed to clean the dataset, generate patches and resize the images. Deep learning models were trained on the ESCC image dataset for feature extractions. This was followed by machine learning classifier for the diagnosis of ESCC. Deep learning models that were used in this study are Resnet50, VGG16, VGG19, and Inception_Resnet_V2 with Logistic Regression (LR) used as classifier. An ensemble model which stacks up the Inception and Resnet. This model preformed with the highest accuracy at 96% with Precision, Recall, and f1 score values at 96%, 96%, and 96%, respectively. This study reports 1) a local ESCC image repository for research purposes, 2) an ensemble ML\/DL model that predicts ESCC with 96% accuracy and 3) also a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for ESCC with a user-interface which will assist histopathologists in diagnosing ESCC with higher speed, efficiency and accuracy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/24d922ba-7072-4ca4-811a-8b85a23fee16\/@r03B8ZQ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Digital histopathology,Medical imaging ,Artificial intelligence ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21356"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"d68aed41-5d4d-4a57-8023-035a84fea58e","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d68aed41-5d4d-4a57-8023-035a84fea58e\/@r03B8ZQ3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mansoor Alam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ibrar Amin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ayesha Sajjad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Hina Zamir<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saad Zaheer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria T.

This study aims to use domain-domain interaction (DDI) data to produce high resolution protein interaction networks with enhanced topological insights for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as well as the more well studies, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). An extensive literature review identified 65 driver genes for HNSCC and 19 genes for TNBC which collectively had 557 and 316 protein domains. Eventually, 343\/557 and 191\/316 domains had well-annotated somatic mutations reported in COSMIC. PPI networks were created using BioGrid and STRING data and the top two hubs in PPI networks were TP53 for HNSCC and EGFR for TNBC, while the top two hubs in DDI networks were PF12796 (NOTCH) and PF07714 (EGFR) for HNSCC and TNBC networks, respectively. The top nodes in the densest sub-clusters based on module analysis in PPI networks were ERBB4, MET and NOTCH1 for HNSCC, and FGFR1, AR, and EGFR for TNBC. For DDI networks, the top nodes in the densest subcluster for HNSCC were PF06816 (NOTCH1-3), while for TNBC PF07714 domains from FGFR1, ERBB2 and EGFR were the top nodes. Our preliminary results re-emphasize the significance of NOTCH, EGFR and TP53, and their domains, in cancer networks. Next, we attempted to decipher potential candidates for drug repurposing and were able to map 20 out of the 31 FDA approved cancer drugs against proteins within our HNSCC network. EGFR was revealed as a hub gene in both HNSCC and TNBC networks with most of the therapies designed against the PF07714 kinase domain of EGFR. PF07714 is also a common domain in ERBB4, EPHA2, MAP2K1 and MET, and was targeted by different drugs in other cancer types. Next, we attempt to undertake an in vitro drug screen of all candidates against HNSCC cell lines to validate our in silico findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2c39acc5-b723-459a-89a6-6a33ac35b9c6\/@r03B8ZQ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Network biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein-protein interactions,Drug discovery,EGFR,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21375"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"9439d296-5ba0-4c88-ab21-b13e10c074c9","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9439d296-5ba0-4c88-ab21-b13e10c074c9\/@r03B8ZQ3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maryam Shah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arsalan Riaz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faisal Khan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Radiographic imaging techniques provide insight into the imaging features of tumor regions of interest (ROIs), while immunohistochemistry and sequencing techniques performed on biopsy samples yield omics data. These imaging and omics feature data can then be correlated and modeled using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to highlight notable associations between tumor genotype and phenotype. Currently, however, the radiogenomics field lacks a unified and robust software platform capable of algorithmically analyzing imaging and omics features using modifiable parameters, detecting significant relationships among these features, and subjecting them to AI-based analysis. To address this gap, we developed ImaGene, a robust AI-based platform that uses omics and imaging features as inputs for different tumor types, performs statistical analyses of the correlations between these data types, and constructs AI models based upon significantly correlated features. It has several modifiable configuration parameters that provide users with complete control over their experiments. For each run, ImaGene produces comprehensive reports that can contribute to the construction of a novel radiogenomic knowledge base, in addition to enabling the deployment and sharing of AI models. To demonstrate the utility of ImaGene, we acquired imaging and omics datasets pertaining to Invasive Breast Cancer (IBC) and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) from public databases and analyzed them with this platform using specific parameters. In both cases, we uncovered significant associations between several imaging features and 11 genes: CRABP1, VRTN, SMTNL2, FABP1, HAND2, HAS1, C4BPA, FAM163A, DSG1, SMTNL2 and KCNJ16 for IBC, and 10 genes: CEACAM6, IGLL1, SERPINA1, NANOG, OCA2, PRLR, ACSM2B, CYP11B1, and VPREB1 for HNSCC. Overall, our software platform is capable of identifying, analyzing, and correlating important features from tumor scans, thereby providing researchers with a reliable and accurate tool for their radiogenomics experiments. We anticipate that ImaGene will become the gold standard for tumor analyses in the field of radiogenomics owing to its ease of use, flexibility, and reproducibility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f18a43b-93e7-46a5-80ce-b28cec47118b\/@s03B8ZQ4\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Image analysis,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21407"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shrey S.

Metabolic reprogramming using aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), is correlated with increased aggressiveness of cancer cells and poor outcome in patients. Therefore, genes involved in this pathway are promising targets for developing cancer therapeutics.<br \/>Method: MIMs has developed a unique platform of augmented intelligence that combines bioinformatics, systems biology and artificial intelligence. It integrates multi-layered omics data with a knowledge-base that aggregates structured data from more than 140 databases as well as unstructured data from the scientific literature. Using this approach a genetic interaction graph (GI-Graph) is inferred per patient, capturing functional relationships between genes in the specific context of the tumor. The GI-Graphs are subsequently used to train supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting gene functionality and potential as a target. Preliminary analysis was performed on transcriptomic data from 321 LumA and 162 TNBC samples, from the TCGA Data Portal and a predictive model was developed using two GI-Graphs from the two subgroups. Briefly, subgraphs, containing genes with functional interactions with the known genes in OXPHOS and glycolysis pathways, were used to extract gene attributes, and to build an algorithm that predicts involvement of a gene in the Warburg effect. Using a testing gene set extracted from the literature the performance of the model was assessed, which showed a true positive rate of 18% and a false positive rate of 0.36%, and outperformed 5-times the classical bioinformatics tools.<br \/>Results: This model predicted 108 genes as the top 1% genes being involved in the metabolic reprogramming of TNBC. Additional information from MIMs&#8217; platform, including differential gene expression between LumA and TNBC, gene pleiotropy and essentiality and the topological metrics, enabled the life scientists to further refine the gene lists, based on the expected characteristics of a good target in oncology. Following this process, 30 genes were selected as potential targets controlling the metabolic reprogramming of TNBC, among which 4 genes were already evaluated in TNBC clinical trials.<br \/>Conclusion: Our preliminary data strongly supports that the predictive model based on the GI-Graphs has the potential to identify promising therapeutic targets for TNBC.\u0009\u0009","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/839806a3-c141-42b2-8288-56292165753a\/@s03B8ZQ4\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Target discovery,Machine learning,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Glycolysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21513"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah Jenna<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Boucher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liebaut Dudragne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdoulaye Baniré Diallo<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is therefore imperative to use these available image datasets for better diagnosis, increased patient outcomes and recovery from deadly diseases. As a result, this study proposes a Colorectal Cancer classification model for detecting KRAS mutation status of Patients through their Radiomic images using the transfer learning of a deep learning pipeline on Apache Spark. The datasets will be curated from National Cancer Institute (NCI), features extraction or classification of Computed tomography(CT) images into CT- based handcrafted radiomic signatures with a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) using the Apache Spark framework, the system uploads the segmented scanning images to the High Distributed File System (HDFS), Confidence Interval(CI), Area Under Curve(AUC), Precision and Recall for Validation cohort, Docker for app deployment and containerization of the model developed for reproducibility, transfer learning and model reuse. The result would be a real-time model using Deep learning pipelines with Apache Spark and Keras Tensor flow for KRAS Mutation detection using Colorectal Cancer images.

However, both recognition and quantification of growth patterns suffer from high interobserver variability among pathologists. Here, we present a large-scale application to automate the segmentation of histologic patterns and reproduce the IASLC grading system to stratify patients and predict prognosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/>A deep learning model was trained to recognize and segment 6 histologic patterns (lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, solid, and cribriform) on 49 whole-slide images from TRACERx (AbdulJabbar et al. 2020). This model was directly applied to an independent cohort, consisting of 4324 hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from 970 patients (the Leicester Archival Thoracic Tumor Investigatory Cohort, Moore et al. 2019).&nbsp;<br \/>Growth pattern segmentation performance was first evaluated against 2433 hand annotations covering 6 patterns from 9 images at a pixel level using Dice coefficient. The average Dice was 0.502. Predicted predominant pattern per tumor was then compared to a subspecialty pathologist, achieving an overall agreement (51%), comparable to the interobserver rate among pathologists (52%, Boland et al. 2017). Discordant cases were more heterogeneous (p=4.5e-10, Shannon diversity based on pathological scores), underscoring the challenges posed by intratumor heterogeneity.<br \/>Patients with a high proportion of micropapillary in the tumor, identified by deep learning, had significantly worse relapse-free survival (RFS) in multivariate analyses including clinical parameters (p=0.00127, Hazard Ratio (HR)=6.4, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.07-19.8, n=827), consistent with previous publication (Cha et al. 2014). The Kaplan-Meier curve for RFS was significantly differentiated with both automated and pathological IASLC grading (p&#60;0.0001). Moreover, patients with predominantly high-grade patterns (solid, micropapillary, cribriform) identified by deep learning had significantly reduced RFS (p=6.22e-4, HR=1.5, 95% CI=1.18-1.8, n=970). The prognostic effect was stronger using IASLC grading (cutoff: 20%, p=5.56e-6, HR=1.7, 95% CI=1.36-2.2), comparable to the pathological score at IASLC grade 3 (cutoff: 20%, p=2.41e-5, HR=1.8, 95% CI=1.35-2.3). A similar performance was observed for overall survival regarding above analyses.&nbsp;<br \/>To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the largest application of deep learning to recognize tumor growth patterns in lung adenocarcinoma. Histologically heterogeneous growth patterns can be automatically identified using a method trained on an independent cohort. Automated tumor grading is significantly associated with patient outcomes, supporting its potential clinical utility. &nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/138228ee-ee66-46d0-a853-358684832661\/@s03B8ZQ4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Histopathology,Deep learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19990"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaoxi Pan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khalid AbdulJabbar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Coelho-Lima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anca-Ioana Grapa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanyun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ho Kwan Alvin Cheung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah J.

Therefore, the determination of robust biomarkers for accurate prediction of response to immunotherapeutic agents remains one of the grand challenges of 21st century. Our primary goal was to investigate if phenotypic differences due to treatment with ICI can be recognized with minimally perturbative molecular tools and guide personalization of immunotherapy. In this work, we provide first-in-class evidence that Raman spectroscopy (an optical method) and machine learning allows sensitive detection of early changes in biomolecular composition of tumors in response to immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). By studying the widely investigated CT26 murine model of colorectal cancer treated with anti-CTLA-4 (n = 8) and anti-PD-L1 (n = 7) ICIs and controls (n = 10), we revealed new biological insights into the nature and degree of microenvironmental modifications induced by exposure to clinically relevant doses of ICI. Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) decomposition of Raman spectral datasets revealed early changes in lipid, nucleic acid, and collagen content of the tumors following therapy. We trained supervised classification models - support vector machines and random forests on the spectral datasets and showed that the models provided excellent prediction accuracies for response to both ICIs and delineated spectral markers specific to each therapy, consistent with their differential mechanisms of action. On the basis of these findings, we sought to determine if the tumor microenvironment changes delineated by Raman spectroscopy correspond to proteomic alterations via quantitative mass spectrometry. Of the more than 6600 proteins identified, about 136 proteins were found to be significantly different in treated tumors relative to controls (p &#60; 0.05 and log2 fold change of &#62; 2). A subset of these differentially expressed proteins is known to regulate lipid metabolism and extracellular matrix composition, while others are known to control transcriptome dynamics or are associated with response to ICI therapy, thereby corroborating our Raman spectroscopic measurements. Our observation of biomolecular changes in the TME should catalyze detailed investigations for translating such markers and label-free Raman spectroscopy for clinical monitoring of immunotherapy response in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58416c5c-9d76-4f9c-a30e-752f3c134a5b\/@s03B8ZQ4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Imaging,Machine learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21772"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Santosh K.
