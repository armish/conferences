[{"Abstract":"A2A and A2B adenosine receptors have been shown to mediate immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting signals in the tumor microenvironment and their inhibition may be a promising treatment strategy for patients with advanced solid tumors. Dual A2A\/A2B inhibition has shown an acceptable safety profile as monotherapy and early signs of clinical activity in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. M1069 is a novel, orally administered, highly selective dual antagonist of the A2A and A2B adenosine receptors that has recently demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in vivo as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in adenosine-rich tumor models. The aim of this Phase Ia First in Human noncontrolled, open-label, multicentre, dose escalation clinical study (NCT05198349) is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary activity of M1069 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable solid tumors.<br \/>Study Design: Patients aged &#8805;18 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &#8804;1, adequate baseline hematological, renal and hepatic function, and with locally advanced or metastatic disease refractory to, or who have progressed with, standard therapy are eligible. Patients who have had prior treatment with another agent targeting the adenosine signalling pathway or prior anticancer treatment within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives are excluded. The study includes a 28-day screening period, a study intervention period of 21-day cycles, a 21-day dose-limiting toxicity observation period, an end of study intervention visit and a safety follow-up period of 30&#177;7 days. Patients (approximately 21-30) will receive M1069 monotherapy twice daily in 21-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or any criterion for withdrawal from study intervention. The starting dose is M1069 150 mg twice daily, with dose escalation decisions (300, 450, 600 and 700 mg twice daily) made by the safety monitoring committee and supported by results of a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM). The primary objectives of the study are to determine the dose toxicity relationship and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if reached, of M1069 and to determine the recommended dose for expansion of M1069 for further exploratory clinical development. These will be measured by the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events and treatment-related adverse events, and, through analysis of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and post-treatment changes in the tumor microenvironment in available paired tumor biopsies, respectively. The target dose-limiting toxicity probability for the MTD is 30% which will be estimated by the BLRM. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using noncompartmental analysis.<br \/>The study is open and patients are being treated at the first dose level.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f843160b-e403-433c-ab52-ba9b3e98be7a\/@z03B8ZYH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Adenosine,Phase I,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20315"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lillian L.

After intravenous (IV) administration, the AACs are designed to be phagocytosed by endogenous antigen presenting cells (APCs) and the E6 and E7 antigens presented on the APC&#8217;s major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). The concurrent delivery of antigen and adjuvant to the APCs is designed to elicit a potent antitumor T cell response to drive HPV16+ tumor killing. Preclinical experiments demonstrated that post IV administration of mouse AAC-HPV in a HPV16 E7-expressing TC-1 mouse model, E7 specific CD8+ T cells are recruited to the tumor, inhibiting tumor growth, prolonging survival, and forming immunological memory. Murine AAC-HPV treatment was also shown to be synergistic with cisplatin combinations. In vitro studies with human volunteer derived SQZ-AAC-HPV demonstrated to be endocytosed by dendritic cells and drive IFN-gamma production by T cell clones specific to human E7. The Phase 1\/2 study&#8217;s biomarker program investigates whether pharmacodynamic effects observed in nonclinical studies correlate with potential clinical benefit. Immunogenic and pharmacodynamic endpoints include quantification and characterization of TILs and tumor microenvironment, changes in numbers and functions of circulating blood cells. In addition, cytokine responses and cell-free HPV16 DNA will be measured.<br \/>Methods: ENVOY-001 (NCT04892043) is open for enrollment to HLA A*02+ patients with HPV16+ recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors and includes escalation cohorts for monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. The study is divided in two parts, the first will assess the safety in monotherapy dose-escalation following a Bayesian Optimal Interval approach. The second part of the study will assess the safety of SQZ-AAC-HPV when combined with nivolumab 360 mg q3w and\/or ipilimumab 3 mg\/kg q3w x4 or 1 mg\/kg q6w when combined with nivolumab. The cycle length is 3 weeks, and patients will receive SQZ-AAC-HPV for up to 1 year or until available autologous drug product is exhausted. Eligible patients including but not limited to anal, cervical and head and neck tumors will undergo a 200 mL whole blood collection at the study site. The manufacturing process takes less than 24 hours to produce multiple cryopreserve patient doses and this therapy does not necessitate pre-conditioning. The vein-to-vein time for the 1st administration is approximately one week. Patients must have a lesion that can be biopsied with acceptable clinical risk and agree to have a fresh biopsy at Screening and on study. A Data Monitoring Committee is in place.

It is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer, and KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutations occur in 3-4% of colorectal cancers (CRC) and in up to 14% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The investigational agent adagrasib, a potent, covalent inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, irreversibly and selectively binds to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> and locks it in its inactive state. Adagrasib was optimized for favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, including long half-life (~24 h), dose-dependent PK, and central nervous system penetration. Initial results have shown encouraging antitumor activity and tolerability of adagrasib monotherapy or combination therapy in patients with CRC or NSCLC harboring KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutations. Cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 are downstream of signaling pathways that lead to cellular proliferation. Palbociclib, a CDK4\/6 inhibitor, disrupts cancer cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest by preventing the G1 to S phase transition. Preclinical data in KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>mouse models suggest enhanced antitumor activity when combining adagrasib and palbociclib compared with either agent as a monotherapy.<br \/>Trial Design: KRYSTAL-16 (NCT05178888) is a multicenter phase I\/Ib trial evaluating the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of adagrasib in combination with palbociclib in patients with solid tumors harboring a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation previously treated with at least 1 standard therapy. The first stage of the trial will comprise a PK lead-in to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions. Exploration of the dose and regimen will continue for the combination of adagrasib (starting dose 400 mg BID) and palbociclib, with expansion cohorts implemented as applicable to further evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical activity of the combination. Decisions regarding dose escalation, expansion, or de-escalation will be determined using the modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI-2) design. Study endpoints include safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and\/or recommended Phase II combination dose regimen (RP2D), plasma PK parameters, and preliminary clinical activity (objective response rate [RECIST v1.1], duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival). Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, patient withdrawal, or death.

The downstream generation of cytosolic DNA activates the cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS)-STimulator of INterferon Gene (STING) signaling axis in both tumor and nearby immune cells, leading to increased induction of type I interferon (IFN-I) and other immune stimulating molecules. TAK-676 is a novel synthetic STING agonist being investigated (+\/- pembrolizumab) in an ongoing first-in-human phase 1 study (NCT04420884). TAK-676 is a potent modulator of the innate immune system and leads to downstream activation of the adaptive immune system to produce antitumor responses in preclinical studies. In contrast to intratumorally injected STING agonists, TAK-676 is optimally designed for reduced serum degradation and enhanced permeability, allowing systemic IV delivery and access to tumor sites and lymphatics. The addition of TAK-676 following radiation therapy may enhance the immune response by increasing the STING-mediated IFN-I release and further stimulate T cell-mediated antitumor immunity, particularly in combination with anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 therapies. Impaired IFN signaling has been linked to checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) resistance. Preclinical studies show that addition of a STING agonist may reverse the mechanisms of resistance in tumors with prior exposure to CPIs. This phase 1 trial was designed to investigate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of TAK-676 + pembrolizumab following radiation therapy (NCT04879849).<br \/>Methods: Patients aged &#8805;18 years with advanced NSCLC, TNBC, or SCCHN who have progressed on CPIs with &#8805;2 lesions, one of which can be targeted with radiation, are being enrolled. Patients receive 8 Gy x 3 fractions of image-guided radiation therapy followed by (after a minimum of 40 hours) IV pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 plus escalating doses of IV TAK-676 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21-day cycle. TAK-676 dose escalation is guided by the Bayesian Optimal Interval design. Patients receive TAK-676 + pembrolizumab until disease progression, intolerance, or withdrawal of consent. Once pharmacologically active dose levels of TAK-676 have been observed, paired biopsies will be collected in patients with a safely accessible lesion outside the radiation field at screening and between days 15 and 21 of cycle 1. The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of TAK-676 + pembrolizumab following radiation therapy; secondary objectives are to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of TAK-676 + pembrolizumab following radiation therapy, and to assess preliminary antitumor activity both locally (in the radiation field) and systemically (non-radiated lesions). As of January 2022, nearly 10% of the planned patients have been enrolled.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/070a5605-ef5c-48c2-848f-7b312575c0f1\/@z03B8ZYH\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,TAK-676,Pembrolizumab,Phase 1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20318"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin Cooper<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven J.

Recent approaches to develop IL-2 therapies with an expanded therapeutic index have targeted the dimeric form (&#946;\/&#947;) of the IL-2 receptor, which is predominantly expressed on na&#239;ve T cells and NK cells, rather than the high affinity trimeric form (&#945;\/&#946;\/&#947;), predominantly expressed on antigen activated T cells and Tregs. Preclinical data support the hypothesis that this &#8220;non-&#945;&#8221; approach favors activating cells that serve as principal mediators of toxicity (NK cells) over antitumor activity (antigen activated T cells). STK-012 is a pegylated, &#945;\/&#946;-IL-2R selective partial agonist engineered to preferentially stimulate antigen-activated CD25+ T cells and avoid systemic NK and na&#239;ve T cell activation. In syngeneic tumor models, subcutaneously (SQ) injected STK-012 mouse surrogate demonstrated reduced toxicities and improved efficacy relative to mouse wild-type IL-2 or a non-&#945; IL-2. In cynomolgus monkeys, acute lung inflammation was induced by aldesleukin and non-&#945;-IL-2, but not by STK-012. STK-012 is in development as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: This is a first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study in adults with advanced solid tumors (NCT05098132). The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of STK-012 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Dose escalation will follow a standard 3+3 design for STK-012 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. STK-012 will be dosed SQ weekly, and pembrolizumab will be dosed IV every 3 weeks. Eligible participants for dose escalation include individuals with non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer and microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient cancers who are relapsed\/refractory to, intolerant to, or refuse standard of care treatment. Expansion cohorts will enroll participants at selected dose(s) and indications on the basis of dose escalation findings. The primary endpoint of safety includes outcomes such as adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities. Efficacy, a secondary endpoint, will include assessments of tumor response according to RECIST v1.1. Exploratory biomarker assessments will include peripheral and tumor measures of immune cell populations and relevant gene\/protein expression. Enrollment in STK-012 monotherapy dose escalation has been initiated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30a17e7f-5180-4bab-8b3e-b085eec13d53\/@A03B8ZYJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Pembrolizumab,Interleukin-2,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20319"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>David Spigel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Spira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitriy Zamarin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David F.

Unfortunately, these therapies can cause serious immune-related adverse events, including death. In CNS cancers, currently available immunotherapies have limited to no efficacy. Our work in glioblastoma (GBM), which is considered one of the most aggressive cancers as well as being universally fatal, is focused on the CD200 immune checkpoint that modulates the immune system through the inhibitory receptor (CD200R1) and activation receptor (CD200AR). The peptide checkpoint ligand (CD200AR-L) was developed to target the CD200AR that downregulates the inhibitory PD-1\/PD-L1, CTLA4 and CD200R immune checkpoints, permitting immune system activation that is less hampered by the inhibitory effects of GBM. Following a positive clinical trial in dogs that spontaneously developed high-grade gliomas, we initiated a first-in-human Phase 1 Study of the CD200 Activation Receptor Ligand (CD200AR-L) and Allogeneic Tumor Lysate Vaccine (GBM6-AD) immunotherapy for Recurrent Glioblastoma (NCT04642937).<br \/>Methods: This is a single-center, first-in-human, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial utilizing a 3+3 design at three dose levels; 3.75micrograms\/kg, 5micrograms\/kg, and 7.25micrograms\/kg. Adults 18 years and old with recurrent GBM and no pre-exiting immune-related condition plus adequate performance score were eligible. Accrual started in December 2020 at dose level 1 with a second cohort having received treatment on dose level 2. CD200AR-L is administered on days 1 and 2 by suprascapular intradermal injection following the application of topical imiquimod. On day 2, a fixed dose of the allogeneic vaccine is injected intradermally at the same site. The &#8220;Induction Phase&#8221; consists of this injection series weekly for 4 weeks with monitoring for dose-limiting toxicity through Day28. The &#8220;Maintenance Phase&#8221; doses the vaccine series monthly for 2 months, then the &#8220;Booster Phase&#8221; doses every eight weeks for 24 months or until end of treatment. Patients are monitored for adverse events, including immune-mediated intracranial edema and other immune-related complications, and their neurological function is scored per NANO criteria. Correlative studies include immune monitoring (including expression of CD200R1, PD1\/PD-L1, and CTLA-4) and MRI imaging assessment per iRANO criteria.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/92c8c45c-823b-4ce5-8f8e-3a245053b590\/@A03B8ZYJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Glioblastoma multiforme,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20320"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael R.

Combination therapy with modified FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) and immunotherapy has been proposed for first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer to improve tolerability and clinical efficacy, respectively (NCCN, Pancreatic. 2021; Vonderheide, <i>Annu. Rev. Med.<\/i> 2020). The present study evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of modified FOLFIRINOX + giloralimab (CD40 agonist) with or without budigalimab (anti-PD-1) in patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer.<br \/>Methods: Multicenter, randomized phase 1b\/2 study (NCT04807972) in patients (18-75 years) with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. The phase 1b (dose escalation) examines the safety dose level of giloralimab in a triplet of modified FOLFIRINOX + giloralimab + budigalimab using a Bayesian optimal interval [BOIN] design. BOIN design is utilized to guide giloralimab escalation decisions. In phase 2 (dose expansion), patients are randomized 1:1:1 to receive treatment with modified FOLFIRINOX (cohort A), modified FOLFIRINOX + giloralimab (cohort B), or modified FOLFIRINOX + giloralimab + budigalimab (cohort C). Randomization is stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Primary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of modified FOLFIRINOX + giloralimab + budigalimab (phase 1b) and to evaluate overall survival in patients treated with modified FOLFIRINOX + giloralimab with or without budigalimab (versus those receiving modified FOLFIRINOX alone; phase 2). Secondary objectives include characterizing the pharmacokinetics of giloralimab and budigalimab in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX, assessing the efficacy of modified FOLFIRINOX + giloralimab with or without budigalimab, and evaluating the safety\/tolerability of modified FOLFIRINOX + giloralimab with or without budigalimab. Patients will receive giloralimab and budigalimab intravenously in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX in a 28-day cycle. Dose-limiting toxicities are assessed during the first cycle of dosing. Adverse events are evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis are collected at designated time points throughout the study. Responses are assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Survival outcomes are described using the Kaplan-Meier method. Approximately 129 patients are planned to be included.

T Cell Antigen-Coupler (TAC) technology is a novel way to genetically modify T cells and to redirect these T cells to target cancer antigens and to activate T cells naturally by co-opting the natural T cell Receptor (TCR). TAC01-HER2 is an autologous T-cell product comprising T cells expressing the HER2 TAC, a chimeric receptor that is genetically engineered into T cells via lentiviral transduction to furnish T cells with two main functions: redirection to and specific recognition of HER2-positive cells, and T cell activation via the endogenous TCR. In vivo models, TAC T-cells can infiltrate tumors and persist for extended period of time, leading to robust and persistent anti-tumor efficacy, with a favorable safety profile. The safety and efficacy of TAC01-HER2 is investigated in the ongoing (TACTIC-2) first-in-human phase I-II study (NCT04727151).<br \/>Methods: Eligible pts are &#8805; 18 years with HER2-positive solid tumors (1+, 2+ or 3+ by IHC, regardless of amplification status) who progressed after at least two lines of systemic therapy. Upon enrollment, pts undergo leukapheresis to obtain T cells for TAC01-HER2 manufacturing. Bridging therapy can be administered prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC). TAC01-HER2 is a single infusion after LDC with a starting dose of 1-3 x 105 cells \/ kg and escalating based on the keyboard statistical dose escalation method. Data safety monitoring committee meetings will be held after each dose level. Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is identified, an additional 3-6 pts will be treated at that dose level. Current planned phase II expansion cohorts include HER2 3+ breast cancer (N=20), HER2 3+ other solid tumors (N=20), and HER2 2+ breast and other solid tumors (N=10). The primary objective for the trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of TAC01-HER2 with primary endpoints of incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and type, frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs). Secondary endpoints include the RP2D, overall response rate, duration of response, overall survival and pharmacokinetics. Exploratory endpoints include assessment of potential biomarkers of response or resistance and characterization of soluble immune factors and relationship to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity and TAC T cell engraftment. Tumor response assessments are performed at 4 weeks, then at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24. After study completion, subjects are followed for survival and long-term safety for up to 15 years.

Cl II and III represent molecularly distinct BRAF alterations driving dimer-dependent signaling. Cl II alterations include single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels and gene fusions that induce BRAF homodimer formation, leading to oncogenic kinase activation. Cl III alterations, typically SNVs, are low activity alterations that promote RAF dimerization and RAS-dependent oncogenic MAPK pathway signaling. Approved BRAFi have limited clinical activity in solid tumors driven by BRAF Cl II or III alterations, highlighting the urgency to develop effective targeted therapies for these patients. Combinations of a RAFi and a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) show promising results in early clinical trials. KIN-2787 is a potent, highly selective type II pan-RAFi designed to target both monomeric &#38; dimeric forms of the altered BRAF kinase and minimize paradoxical activation, a liability often observed with other RAFi that can adversely impact tolerability &#38; require addition of a MEKi to suppress pathway activation. KIN-2787 has favorable pharmaceutical properties, achieves substantial systemic exposures in pre-clinical toxicology studies, &#38; induces regressions in human cancer xenograft models driven by BRAF Cl I, II, or III alterations. Combinations of KIN-2787 with a MEKi show promising activity in preclinical models.<br \/>Methods: This is a FIH, multicenter, non-randomized Ph1 study (NCT04913285) of KIN-2787 in adult pts with BRAF mutant advanced &#38; metastatic solid tumors (AMST). KIN-2787 will be given orally bid continuously in 28-day cycles until drug intolerance or disease progression. Planned sample size is approx. 155 pts in 2 parts: Part A is a dose-escalation to MTD open to pts with AMST driven by either BRAF genomic alterations (Cl I, II or III ) or by NRAS. Part A1 assesses single agent KIN-2787; Part A2 assesses KIN-2787 in combination w\/binimetinib. Part B will evaluate a selected dose of KIN-2787 in 3 cohorts of pts (MEL, NSCLC, or other AMST), each driven by BRAF Cl II or III alterations. Standard Ph1 enrollment criteria are required (ECOG PS 0-2, normal organ function, prior receipt of standard treatment or medical judgment that such is not appropriate).

Reduced interferon (IFN) signaling, immune escape and immunosuppressive tumor phenotypes have been proposed as resistance mechanisms, suggesting innate immune cell stimulation in the tumor microenvironment as a potential strategy to overcome resistance. Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a cytosolic protein critical for induction of type 1 IFN-dependent innate immunity. Cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) is expressed by tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, including tumor associated macrophages (TAM), and promotes immune escape by limiting CD8+ T-cell infiltration. TAK-500 is an ISAC that consists of three parts: a STING agonist payload based on TAK-676 (currently under phase 1 clinical evaluation [NCT04420884, NCT04879849]), the IgG1 anti-CCR2 antibody (previously evaluated in early phase studies), and a self-immolating maleimide-containing protease-cleavable peptide linker. By targeting STING to CCR2 expressing myeloid cells, TAK-500 has three possible mechanisms of action: activation of IFN response, reprogramming of suppressive intratumoral CCR2+ cells to an inflammatory phenotype, and blockade of suppressive TAM recruitment. TAK-500 thus has the potential to overcome resistance to CPIs in both CPI refractory and immunologically excluded or deserted tumors.<br \/>Methods: This phase 1a\/1b open-label study (NCT05070247) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TAK-500 in patients aged &#8805;18 years with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, mesothelioma or triple-negative breast cancer. Patients must have had progressive disease or intolerance to all standard therapy. In the initial dose escalation phase, patients will receive single-agent intravenous (IV) TAK-500 administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W) in 21-day cycles to determine the pharmacologically active dose (PAD) range. An additional escalation cohort will receive TAK-500 in combination with IV pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W in 21-day cycles, with the initial TAK-500 dose level beginning 1-2 dose levels below the predicted single agent PAD range. Dose escalation in both single agent and combination cohorts will be guided by the Bayesian Optimal Interval design. A subsequent dose expansion phase will evaluate TAK-500 in combination with pembrolizumab. Planned enrollment for both escalation and expansion cohorts is ~106 patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3e2407c0-b930-4083-9e37-9ea2403fa82c\/@A03B8ZYJ\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),TAK-500,STING,Phase 1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20324"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer R.

NL-201 is being developed as a potent activator of CD8+ T cells and NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. Binding to the beta and gamma subunits stimulates dose-dependent expansion and tumor infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells, thereby enhancing the immune response in the tumor. The absence of binding to the IL-2 alpha subunit reduces the undesirable effects of traditional IL-2 therapies, such as vascular leak syndrome and expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. As such, NL-201 is designed to promote the desired immunomodulatory anti-tumor effects of IL-2 with an improved safety profile.<br \/>Methods: NL201-101 is a Phase 1 first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation and cohort expansion study consisting of two parts. Part 1 is a monotherapy dose-escalation study in up to 60 adult patients with advanced and\/or refractory solid tumors to define the safety profile and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of NL-201. During dose escalation, two different schedules will be evaluated: dosing every 21 days (Schedule A), or on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle (Schedule B).<b> <\/b>Tumor response will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 and\/or RECIST for use in cancer immunotherapy trials (iRECIST).<b> <\/b>In Part 2, patients with pathologically proven diagnosis of melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (up to N=30\/cohort), who have advanced and\/or refractory measurable disease and have failed at least one line of treatment, which may include checkpoint inhibitors, will be enrolled.

With limited expression observed in normal tissues, FAP is a promising therapeutic and imaging target for delivery of radionuclides to cancer tissues. FAP-2286, a low-molecular-weight cyclic peptide that potently and selectively binds to FAP, is attached to a linker and tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (DOTA) cage that can be used to conjugate radionuclides such as lutetium-177 (<sup>177<\/sup>Lu) or gallium-68 (<sup>68<\/sup>Ga) for therapeutic or imaging applications, respectively. <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAP-2286 has demonstrated antitumor activity in preclinical studies. The LuMIERE study (NCT04939610) is the first phase 1\/2 clinical trial of an FAP-targeted radionuclide therapy evaluating <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAP-2286 in patients with FAP-expressing solid tumors that are identified with the imaging agent <sup>68<\/sup>Ga-FAP-2286.<br \/>Methods: Eligible adult patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and measurable disease (per RECIST v1.1) will be selected for treatment with <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAP-2286 on the basis of FAP expression using <sup>68<\/sup>Ga-FAP-2286. In phase 1, tumors must be refractory to or have progressed following prior treatment, with no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Phase 1 includes dose escalation of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAP-2286, starting at 3.7 GBq to a maximum of 9.25 GBq. Patients may receive up to 6 cycles of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAP-2286 administered on day 1 of each 6-week cycle. Three to 12 patients will be treated at each dose level in the dose-escalation portion. Tolerability will be assessed across multiple doses for determination of a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), which may be further evaluated in a phase 1 dose-expansion portion. FDG-PET\/CT scans will be collected prior to treatment, and patients will be imaged by planar and SPECT\/CT scans at multiple time points to calculate organ and tumor dosimetry to determine absorbed radiation dose. Disease status will be assessed per RECIST v1.1 every 6 weeks. The primary objective of phase 1 is to evaluate the safety of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAP-2286 and determine the RP2D. Secondary objectives include the assessment of radiation dosimetry, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAP-2286 and the evaluation of safety and tumor uptake of <sup>68<\/sup>Ga-FAP-2286. Phase 2 will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and dosimetry of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAP-2286 in patients with select FAP-expressing solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/244f11dc-3109-4ec9-afc9-3810dfe639ad\/@B03B8ZYK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Phase I,FAP-2286,fibroblast activation protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20326"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jonathan McConathy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mallika Dhawan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajit H.

TLR agonists amplify tumor antigen-specific immune responses in the context of anti-PD-1 therapy. TransCon TLR7\/8 Agonist is designed as a long-acting prodrug to provide localized delivery of resiquimod, a potent TLR7\/8 agonist. TransCon TLR7\/8 Agonist has the potential to improve on challenges of pattern recognition receptor agonist treatments by providing prolonged high local concentrations of resiquimod and promoting potent anti-tumoral responses while reducing systemic drug exposure and related adverse events. TransCon TLR7\/8 Agonist comprises 3 main components: resiquimod, a polymeric hydrogel microparticle carrier, and a linker bound permanently to the hydrogel microparticle carrier on one end and transiently to resiquimod on the other. TLR-mediated T cell activation induces PD-1 expression on T cells, providing a clear rationale to study TransCon TLR7\/8 Agonist alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (pembro). Intratumoral TransCon TLR7\/8 Agonist is expected to stimulate innate and adaptive immune response in the tumor microenvironment and further enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors like pembro.<br \/>Methods: transcendIT-101 is a multicenter, first-in-human, Phase 1\/2 study in 3 parts in adult patients with locally advanced, unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic solid tumors. All patients must have at least 2 measurable lesions by RECIST 1.1 that are predesignated as target-injected and target non-injected lesions, respectively. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, define the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TransCon TLR7\/8 Agonist alone or in combination with pembro. Parts 1 and 2 Dose Escalation (Phase 1) use a standard 3+3 design with increasing doses of TransCon TLR7\/8 Agonist alone (Part 1) or with 200 mg intravenous pembro in solid tumors where pembro monotherapy may have clinical activity (Part 2). Each part will enroll &#8776;20 patients. Part 3 Combination Dose Expansion (Phase 2) will evaluate preliminary clinical efficacy of TransCon TLR7\/8 Agonist at the RP2D determined in Part 2 combined with pembro. Currently planned expansion cohorts are 1) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 2) other HPV-associated tumors (anal, vulvar, cervical, penile, vaginal). Each cohort will be analyzed using a Simon 2-stage design and will enroll &#8776;50 patients. Secondary objectives are TransCon TLR7\/8 Agonist pharmacokinetics and its antitumor activity using ORR, duration of response, time to response by RECIST 1.1 and itRECIST; progression-free survival; overall survival.

HRAS preferentially activates PI3K 5-fold more efficiently than KRAS, while KRAS is a more efficient activator of RAF (Yan et al. 1998). Further, mutant HRAS is insufficient for oncogenic transformation if it is unable to recruit PI3K in preclinical models (Gupta et al. 2007). Conversely, mutant PI3K requires RAS to drive tumor growth (Zhao and Vogt 2008). HRAS mutation\/overexpression and PIK3CA mutations\/amplifications account for up to 50% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Recognition of these interdependencies was the basis for the evaluation of HNSCC PDX models (HRAS-mutant, HRAS wildtype-overexpressed, PIK3CA-amplified, and PIK3CA-mutant) which demonstrated additive and synergistic growth effects that confirmed the codependency of these pathways, thus providing robust rationale for investigating combined pathway inhibition in the clinic. The KURRENT trial is enrolling patients with HRAS and\/or PIK3CA-dependent tumors who will receive combination treatment with tipifarnib (a potent and selective inhibitor of farnesyltransferase, a critical enzyme for HRAS activity) and alpelisib (an inhibitor of PI3K with inhibitory activity predominantly against the PI3K&#945; isoform).<br \/>Methods: The KURRENT trial (KO-TIP-013, NCT04809233) is an ongoing multicenter, open-label, 2-cohort, phase 1\/2 trial designed to evaluate the safety of the combination of tipifarnib and alpelisib, determine the recommended combination dose(s) regimen, and evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with recurrent\/metastatic (R\/M) HNSCC whose tumors are dependent upon HRAS and\/or PIK3CA signaling. Dependency is defined as an overexpression of the HRAS protein, and\/or a PIK3CA mutation and\/or amplification. The trial will enroll 40 HNSCC patients (oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx or hypopharynx, sinonasal, nasopharyngeal, or unknown primary subsites regardless of human papillomavirus status); 20 each into two biomarker defined cohorts (Cohort 1: PIK3CA; Cohort 2: HRAS). Participants must have documented treatment failure from at least one prior therapy in the R\/M setting and have measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. At the starting dose level, participants will receive tipifarnib at 300 mg twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 and alpelisib 200 mg each morning continuously during a 28-day cycle. The trial will use an adaptive dose escalation design (based on a Bayesian logistic regression model) to characterize safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the combination to identify the Optimal Biologically Active Dose (OBAD) while maintaining a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate &#60;33%. No formal interim analysis is planned as the model-based dose escalation process requires decisions based on real-time evaluation of aggregate toxicity and efficacy data. All observed\/available data among each cohort will be evaluated before choosing the combination dose for a subsequent cohort.

TF is a protein overexpressed in many solid tumors and is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. XB002 binds to TF without interfering with the coagulation pathway. With its mechanism of action, XB002 has been designed to improve the therapeutic potential of ADCs targeting TF and has demonstrated activity in several solid tumor xenograft models. The purpose of this ongoing first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies) and preliminary antitumor activity of XB002. Presented here is the trial design.<br \/>Methods: This is a phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and dose expansion study (NCT04925284). Patients must be &#8805;18 years old and have an ECOG performance status of 0-1 and adequate organ and marrow function. Patients will be treated until radiographic progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) or unacceptable toxicity. The dose-escalation stage will use a modified i3+3 design; patients with advanced solid tumors (~21 patients) will receive XB002 IV once every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint for dose escalation is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\/recommended dose (RD) of XB002 per Cohort Review Committee. The MTD\/RD will be further evaluated in multiple tumor-specific expansion cohorts of advanced solid tumors (~30 patients per cohort) using a Simon&#8217;s 2-stage design. Tumor-specific cohorts (number of prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease) include: non-small cell lung cancer (&#8804;3); urothelial cancer (&#8804;3); platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (&#8804;3); cervical cancer (&#8804;2); squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (&#8804;3); and pancreatic cancer (1-2). Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and had radiographic progression during or after their last systemic therapy. The primary endpoint for cohort expansion is objective response rate per RECIST v1.1 by investigator. Additional endpoints include safety\/tolerability, XB002 pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, duration of response and PFS per RECIST v1.1 by investigator, overall survival, and changes in tumor markers from baseline.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/51a463ac-2fe8-46ef-a9dc-8ab7bb53b296\/@B03B8ZYK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Anticancer therapy,Monoclonal antibodies,Tissue factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20329"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melissa Johnson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susanna Ulahannan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrae Vandross<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haeseong Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leo Faoro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raffaella Faggioni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Lin Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shailaja Uttamsingh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Tolcher<\/i><\/presenter>.

Multiple <i>in vitro<\/i> assays have shown that PRS-344\/S095012 inhibits PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling while simultaneously activating 4-1BB signaling on T cells. This resulted in a synergistic effect on both pathways leading to anti-tumor immune responses. PRS-344\/S095012 presents mAb-like pharmacokinetics <i>in vivo<\/i> and non-clinical mouse models demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in anti-PD-L1 refractory tumors. In the higher dose range, complete tumor regression was achieved in PD-L1 high and PD-L1 low expressing xenograft mouse models.

Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 0 or 1, RECIST 1.1 measurable disease and should have documented progression on prior therapy. Prior therapy with 4-1BB agonists is prohibited. Phase 1 is a dose escalation guided by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model and a 28-day dose limiting toxicities (DLT) period. Primary objectives are safety and tolerability of PRS-344\/S095012; secondary objectives include exploration of antitumor activity and evaluation of pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamics and comprehensive biomarker program will be explored. Additional patients may be enrolled to backfill cohort(s)to further explore pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic signals.

IRN-IV is also widely used off-label for a range of adult and pediatric solid tumors including recurrent Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, Wilms tumor, gynecologic cancers, lung cancer and medulloblastoma. Recently, commercially available intravenous irinotecan has been administered orally (IRN-IVPO) in pediatric patients to improve convenience, reduce in-clinic time and overall cost of treatment. Unfortunately, the palatability of the intravenous preparation is poor, leading to reduced compliance especially in younger pediatric patients. Development of an advanced formulation to improve tolerability and patient compliance is an important unmet need. VAL-413 is a novel formulation developed to improve palatability of oral irinotecan. We will report on an ongoing Phase 1-2 first-in-human clinical trial of VAL-413, designed to test the hypothesis that VAL-413 improves palatability without significant pharmacokinetic differences from IRN-IVPO using intra-patient comparison of pharmacokinetic profiles. The evaluation of two dose levels will help to formally define a recommended dose for advanced clinical studies.<br \/>Trial Design: Patients &#8805; 1 year of age or &#8804; 30 years of age with recurrent pediatric solid tumors and adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function, for whom irinotecan therapy is a treatment option, are eligible. Up to 20 eligible patients will receive VAL-413 90mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/day or 110mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/day using a standard 3 + 3 design. During the first cycle of treatment, each patient will receive four daily doses of VAL&#8209;413 and one daily dose of IRN-IVPO, together with five (5) days of concurrent temozolomide. Pharmacokinetic assessments will follow both VAL-413 and IRN-IVPO administration using a limited sampling strategy. During all subsequent cycles, only VAL&#8209;413 will be given with temozolomide in 5&#8209;day courses administered every 21 days. Up to 17 cycles of treatment may be administered on this study.<br \/>Outcome Measures: Toxicity is assessed by NCI CCTCAEv5; tumor response is assessed by RECIST 1.1. A palatability survey instrument will assess palatability of VAL-413 vs. IRN-IVPO; and comparative intrapatient pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites will be assessed in all patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ef585be5-4135-47ae-8eed-c71039f368e1\/@B03B8ZYK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I, II, or III clinical trials in pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Irinotecan,Solid tumors,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20331"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James Geller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javier Oesterheld<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis M.

Here we present data from two independent phase I clinical trials evaluating IL13R&#945;2-targeted CAR therapy (NCT02208362) and C134 oncolytic viral (OV) therapy (NCT03657576) for the treatment of recurrent GBM (rGBM), along with preclinical studies supporting the utility of combining these two therapies. For NCT02208362, locoregional delivery of IL13R&#945;2-targeted CAR T cells were evaluated in heavily pretreated patients with rGBM. Interrogating biomarkers of clinical response revealed that levels of intratumoral T cells prior to treatment were positively associated with overall survival; furthermore, two patients who achieved a complete response had the highest levels of intratumoral CD3+ T cells pre-therapy. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies which increase endogenous immune infiltrates could augment CAR T cell mediated responses. For NCT03657576, intratumoral delivery of C134, a herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) that has been genetically engineered to safely replicate and kill glioma tumor cells, is also being evaluated for treatment of rGBM. We report findings from a patient treated intratumorally with 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> pfu of C134. At 6-7 weeks post treatment this patient had MRI changes that suggested possible recurrence or pseudoprogression, and therefore underwent resection with biopsy assessment. Evaluation of virus-treated areas showed increased immune infiltrates as compared to untreated tumor sites, suggesting that C134 activated host immune responses. These clinical findings provide the rationale for evaluating a combination therapy of C134 OV and IL13R&#945;2-CAR T cells to potentially reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enhance CAR therapy. In orthotopic GBM models in nude mice, we show that co-treatment with the two agents gave no adverse reaction, and more notably pre-treatment with C134 re-shaped the TME by increasing immune cell infiltrates and enhanced the efficacy of sub-therapeutic doses of CAR T cell therapy delivered either intraventricularly or intratumorally. Ongoing preclinical studies aim to provide detailed phenotypic analysis, as well as a mechanistic understanding of this combination approach to support the potential benefit of a soon to be opened combination trial evaluating C134 and IL13R&#945;2-CAR T cells. In this clinical trial in patients with IL13R&#945;2+ rGBM and anaplastic astrocytoma, increasing doses of intratumorally administered C134 will be followed by dual intracranial intratumoral and intraventricular administration of IL13R&#945;2-targeted CAR T cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/552a68e2-ec45-418b-af0c-849559e4b22c\/@B03B8ZYK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Oncolytic virus,Glioblastoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21042"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christine E.
