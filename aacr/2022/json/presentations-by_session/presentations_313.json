[{"Abstract":"The implementation of trastuzumab has revolutionized the clinical management of HER2 positive breast cancers. Unfortunately, 50% of patients are resistant to the treatment. Researchers have already designed alternative anti-HER2 agents, such as pertuzumab and lapatinib. Still, predicting which patients will benefit from the therapy would prevent overtreatment and avoid unnecessary risks of side effects. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, and participate in almost all biological processes, including cancer. Since aberrant miRNA levels can be detected both at tissue level and in the circulation, they are good candidates as predictive and prognostic biomarkers. This study had access to tumor tissue samples from the phase III NeoALTTO trial, aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a HER2 dual blockade with trastuzumab and Lapatinib vs single blocking, in concomitance with chemotherapy, in a pre-operative setting. The primary end-point of the study was pathologic complete response (pCR); the secondary end-point event-free survival (EFS). Focusing on the trastuzumab arm, we identified both a predictive signature (hsa-miR-31-3p, OR 0.70, 95%CI: 0.53-0.92 and hsa-miR-382-3p, OR 1.39, 95%CI: 1.01-1.91) with an AUC value of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.60-0.87), and a prognostic signature (miR-153-3p, HR 1.83, 95%CI: 1.34-2.50 and miR-219a-5p, HR 0.629, 95%CI: 0.51-0.79) leading to a C-statistics of 0.730 (95%CI: 0.63-0.83). Moreover, we identified 2 miRNAs (miR-215-5p and miR-30c-2-3p) associated to EFS with a statistically significant interaction term with pCR (p.interaction: 0.017 and 0.038, respectively). Aiming at deepening the understanding of resistance mechanism, we modulated the expression of miR-31-3p and miR-382-3p <i>in vitro<\/i>, upon trastuzumab treatment in HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines. Given that miR-31-3p negatively correlates with pCR, we transfected it in HER2-addicted SKBr3 cells to appreciate a possible gain of resistance to trastuzumab; conversely, miR-382-3p positively correlates with pCR and was transfected in HER2 non-addicted HCC1954 cells. Western blot analysis of HER2 signaling pathway highlighted that overexpression of miR-31-3p was able to counteract the reduction of phosphorylated HER2 levels induced by trastuzumab treatment in SKBR3 cells compared to control. Interestingly, miR-31-3p upmodulation increased the proliferation of both treated and non-treated SKBr3 cell in a 3D setting. Conversely, miR-382-3p overexpression in HCC1954 cells only slightly increased responsiveness to trastuzumab in the 3D setting, compared to control. Trastuzumab efficacy also relies on the immune system reaction, thus, <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments will likely provide further insights into the mechanism of action of these miRNAs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/336c17af-ed91-4c62-910c-6262490bec42\/@x03B8ZBq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Biomarkers,Breast cancer,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12642"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Giulia Cosentino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Pizzamiglio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara M.

Tumor-only NGS tests of biomarkers typically rely on germline reference sets in order to subtract germline variants from biomarker scores. Many germline reference sets lack sufficient population diversity to ensure consistent test quality for all patients. Informatic strategies such as somatic\/germline zygosity prediction are often necessary to reduce bias introduced from germline variation and population-specific artefacts and mitigate the risk of inflating TMB and MSI scores.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We sequenced germline samples from a curated set of research-consented patients representing diverse ancestries on a hybrid capture panel (N=1047 patients, from 10 populations). The tested groups included: African-American=416, Hispanic=162, Ashkenazi=130, Asian=127, Caucasian=85, Middle Eastern=44, Native American=27, Pacific Islander=25, Indian=25, and African=6. We confirmed that both rare population-specific alleles and population-specific technical artefacts contributed to spurious results from biomarker score inflation in underrepresented populations. To mitigate bias and universally improve scores in both MSI and TMB, we combined 1) an ancestry-diverse panel of germline samples assembled from the targeted panel, 2) population-specific public database filtering, 3) informatic germline variant subtraction, and 4) a heuristic for population-neutral target space selection.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Inter-population comparisons of MSI scores (Kruskal-Wallis p of 4.6*10^-69) and TMB scores (Kruskal-Wallis p of 3.7*10^-6) differed significantly in mutation signature errors prior to the mitigation work described in the methods. Application of the germline knowledge base filters and population-neutral target selection reduced the overall error rate (51% for TMB and 16% for MSI), and reduced inter-population score differences. TMB error rates reduced most for African, Pacific Islander, and African-American patients (100%, 71%, and 58%, respectively). Conversely, MSI error rates reduced most for Caucasian, Hispanic, and Asian patients (24%, 21%, and 20%, respectively).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The incorporation of a diverse population set in this study empowered development of a more equitable bioinformatic approach, and significantly improved TMB and MSI determination across all populations. Qualitative differences in the sources of error per population and per biomarker type were associated with differing responses to each mitigation strategy. &#8203;&#8203;These findings underscore the technical and clinical value of incorporating diverse ancestry reference sets and identifying non-biased assay targets to optimize personalized therapy selection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/07e78749-1f1e-40d4-8468-d4b98482ad93\/@x03B8ZBq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microsatellite instability,Tumor mutational burden,Population bias,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12643"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth R.

CRC is often treated with chemotherapeutic agents 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin, but predictive biomarkers are limited. We hypothesized that tumor expression of genes related to extent of drug exposure, stratified by p53 status, is associated with clinical outcomes on these regimens. To this end, we evaluated the prognostic and predictive significance of genes within p53-independent, p53-dependent, pan-drug, and drug-specific gene signatures established in CRC cells treated with 5-FU, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin. CRC patient samples were analyzed by DNA\/RNA next-generation sequencing at Caris Life Sciences, and real-world survival outcomes were inferred from insurance claims data and Kaplan-Meier estimates. Samples with benign or no <i>TP53<\/i> mutations detected (wt) (n=2983) or <i>TP53<\/i> loss-of-function (LOF) mutations (n=6229) were stratified (high\/low) by median expression of signature genes for comparison. Overall prognostic and predictive values in response to 5-FU, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin, regardless of line of therapy or concurrent therapies, or first-line FOLFOX were evaluated to estimate the contribution of each drug. From signatures established in CRC cell lines, a prognostic effect was observed for genes in p53 wt (n=19) and LOF (n=22) subgroups, with a similar survival effect observed for several genes (n=16). Both prognostic and non-prognostic gene expression had a significant effect on survival outcomes following specific drug treatments. Predictive genes included BTG2, a p53-dependent gene upregulated by 5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin in CRC cells that predicted better outcomes when expressed at high levels in p53 wt patients. Several genes in drug-specific signatures were predictive in a drug-specific manner including RABGAP1L and RAD51B (irinotecan), and SAT1 (oxaliplatin), suggesting their particular relevance for patients receiving these drugs. For some genes such as RABGAP1L and RAD51B, drug treatment downregulated gene expression but high expression predicted better survival in patients, suggesting benefit of combination therapy to limit such effects. From a real-world cohort of p53 wt and LOF CRC tumors, we demonstrate the prognostic and predictive potential of candidate gene expression in response to commonly used chemotherapeutics. Accompanying data on drug regulation of predictive genes provides valuable information in evaluating clinical impact of pan-drug or drug-specific mechanisms. Future directions include associations with clinically relevant features (microsatellite instability, tumor sidedness, and age), establishment of multi-gene signatures to improve clinical utility, and evaluation of other regimens including FOLFIRI and FOLFOXIRI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4189d0b8-7e51-4f68-83a9-defad656c16d\/@x03B8ZBq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Chemotherapy response,p53,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12644"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lindsey Carlsen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Elliott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marzia Capelletti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Micheal Hall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip A.

We have developed and validated the Xerna TME Panel as a novel machine learning-based RNA-sequencing biomarker assay that guides patient selection for tumor microenvironment (TME)-targeted therapies across multiple tumor types. Gene expression data sets from both public sources and clinical practice representing over 5000 samples across 7 different tumor types were analyzed using the Xerna TME Panel. The Xerna TME Panel consists of an artificial neural net that learns complex gene expression interactions between angiogenesis and tumor immune biologies and robustly classifies patient samples into one of four TME biomarker subtypes: Angiogenesis (A), Immune Suppressed (IS), Immune Active (IA), or Immune Desert (ID). The vast majority (&#62;75%) of all samples were assigned a TME class designation with confidence scores in the upper quartile and had nearly bimodal distributions for biomarker-positive versus -negative classifications. When compared to other independent gene signatures, such as those describing angiogenesis\/mesenchymal biology, inflammation, and immune suppression, the expression profiles from the Xerna TME subtypes showed enrichment of those biological processes. Each TME subtype represented between ~15-40% of subjects of each tumor type, indicating balanced representation of subgroups within the patient populations. The Xerna TME designations were prognostic across tumor types, with &#8220;A&#8221; tumors generally associated with the worst survival and &#8220;IA&#8221; tumors associated with the best survival. The predictive ability of the Xerna TME Panel to enrich for tumor responses to targeted therapies in gastric cancer was also evaluated. In a ramucirumab+paclitaxel clinical cohort, the Xerna TME Panel high Angiogenesis score tumors (A and IS) demonstrated a 48% response rate compared to a 31% for low Angiogenesis score tumors (IA and ID). In an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) cohort, high Immune score tumors (IA and IS) showed a response rate of 34% vs. 5% for low Immune score tumors (A and ID). Within the microsatellite stable patients (MSS), which historically have low response rates to ICIs, the Xerna TME Panel was able to enrich for responses between Immune high vs. Immune low score patients (25% vs. 3%). Currently in use to prospectively enroll patients into a Phase 3 ovarian cancer clinical trial and in development as a companion diagnostic (CDx) assay, the Xerna TME Panel is a robust, pan-cancer biomarker assay capable of characterizing TME dominant biologies to further advance the matching of patients with targeted therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3bf357b7-4d18-4302-af93-af7cde2446f2\/@x03B8ZBq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Machine learning,RNA sequencing,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12645"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Seema Iyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luka Ausec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Pointing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matjaz Zganec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Cvitkovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miha Stajdohar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valerie Chamberlain Santos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerry Culm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mokenge Malafa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeeyun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rafael Rosengarten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Benjamin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mark T.

However, limited studies have evaluated markers that might be predictive of response to neoadjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and endocrine treatment). Defining such key markers that are associated with treatment response could offer new insights on the relative molecular mechanisms and provide more tailored treatment regimens to target pathways that might be over-represented. We aimed to identify mRNA expression markers associated with breast cancer patients&#8217; response to neoadjuvant treatment from a pool of studies in which tumor samples were collected at pre-treatment and on-treatment timepoints. We collated 1194 pre- and on-treatment samples (721 unique patients) from 9 publicly available gene expression datasets that met our inclusion criteria. The standardized gene expression values from each study were merged in a global matrix of 1551 genes and 1194 samples. Differential Gene Expression Analysis adjusted for timepoint, pam50 subtype (as predicted by the <i>genefu<\/i> package in R), treatment and batch effects was conducted. 14 significantly (FDR = 0.05) differentially expressed were identified (<i>CCNA2, RFC3, VRK1, PSMB2, ALDH7A1, RRM2, ADRM1, TSPAN4, ZNF473, RNH1, HDAC1, CDK1, SMC1A and TOR1AIP1<\/i>) when responders and non-responders were compared, some of which are known drug targets (e.g. <i>PSMB2<\/i>\/carfilzomib). Using the set of identified genes we performed Monte-Carlo consensus clustering on the full set (optimal number of clusters: 6). Clusters were significantly associated with response (p = 2&#183;10<sup>-8<\/sup>), timepoint (p &#60; 10<sup>-15<\/sup>) and pam50 subtype (p &#60; 10<sup>-15<\/sup>), but not treatment (p = 0.35). We then split our data into a training, a validation and a test set (776, 299, 119 samples respectively) and used the 14 genes (alone or in combination with metadata) as predictors to fit three types of machine learning models (lasso-regularized Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines). Support Vector Machines demonstrated the best classification performance on the validation set (75% classification accuracy) and achieved accuracy of 80% on the test set. Pathway analysis based on the identified genes revealed enriched nuclear membrane organization, protein deubiquitination, DNA replication and histone modification pathways. Prediction of response to treatment at baseline or mid-treatment can aid in patient stratification in the neoadjuvant setting and separate patients who would benefit from treatment the most and could undergo a less extensive surgical operation from patients who are unlikely to respond and should be scheduled for surgery sooner. This kind of early intervention has the potential to lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects from unnecessary treatment administration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae0e9dde-96f4-42b6-a7c5-b36a8e96184c\/@x03B8ZBq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Risk prediction,Machine learning,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12647"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aristeidis Sionakidis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonine D.

Program death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its corresponding receptor (PD-1) are the target of most FDA-approved ICIs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, PD-L1 levels are predictive of response to targeting drugs in lung and other cancers. However, PD-L1 is not predictive in other tumor types including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). PD-L1 is typically measured on tumor biopsies or archival tissues and we hypothesized that the lack of PD-L1 predictive power is due to tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution. To test this notion, we embarked upon the generation of a PD-L1 probe that would enable real time assessment of PD-L1 across sites of disease using molecular imaging. We leveraged atezolizumab, a highly specific PD-L1 therapeutic antibody with a mutant Fc. Atezolizumab (ATZ) was labeled with 89Zr after conjugation with a bifunctional chelator and evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET). In extensive preclinical studies using multiple patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with variable PD-L1 levels, we show that 89Zr-ATZ PET is able to distinguish RCC with variable PD-L1 expression. These data set the foundation for an investigator new drug (IND) approval from the FDA and an ongoing clinical trial in RCC patients (NCT04006522). Consistent with our hypothesis, 89Zr-ATZ PET shows substantial PD-L1 heterogeneity not only across but also within patients at different sites of disease. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that PD-L1 levels may be predictive of response to ICI. By assessing PD-L1 expression in real time, 89Zr-ATZ PET may enable: (1) the identification of patients most likely to respond to PD-L1\/PD-1 targeted therapies; (2) tailored management of the disease across different sites; (3) the evaluation of interventions that modulate PD-L1 levels; (4) insights into toxicities; and (5) probing resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c5e5f28-d643-4d00-843b-fa114546cb5d\/@x03B8ZBq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PET,PD-L1,Heterogeneity,Clinical trial,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12648"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Aditi Mulgaonkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Layton Woolford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roy Elias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kien Nham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bing Guan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guiyang Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Stevens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanina Toffessi Tcheuyap<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sydney Haldeman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Miyata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deyssy Carrillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Qian (Janie) Qin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nirmish Singla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isaac Bowman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Cadeddu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vitaly Margulis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alana Christie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Payal Kapur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Pedrosa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianna Dakanali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Orhan Oz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiankai Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Brugarolas<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although, other immune cell subsets were shown to be associated with clinical efficacy, their relative impact and combined effect in predicting improved long-term survival warrant further investigation. Using computational image analysis of multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) immune marker panels, we sought to identify single and combined biomarkers of the tumor immune contexture in association with long-term OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with Durvalumab.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pre-treatment tumor samples from advanced NSCLC patients (n = 210) enrolled in durvalumab nonrandomized phase 1\/2 trial (10 mg\/kg Q2W, CP1108\/NCT01693562), were stained using IHC and 6-marker mIF panels to detect markers of immune cells, cell functional state and tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) (PD-L1, CD8, PD-1, Ki67, CD68, CD20, CD1c, NKp46, CD66b, ICOS, FOXP3). Cell marker density (cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>), distribution and proximity were quantified and analyzed in association with overall survival.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Computational image analysis of the tumor immune contexture revealed a greater immune inflamed phenotype, both innate (macrophages, dendritic cells) and adaptive (T and B cells), in NSCLC patients with long OS &#62;2 years compared to those with short OS &#60; 1 year (fold change &#62; 2, p &#60; 0.0001).

Specifically, among the key findings, combined biomarkers of CD68+ PD-L1+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells predicts for a significant increase in OS for patients with high vs low marker density (HR = 0.21, 95%CI 0.12 - 0.39, p &#60;10<sup>-7<\/sup>; mOS 39.5 months [high], 6.5 months [low]). Whereas, in patients with high density of either single biomarkers CD68+ PD-L1+ macrophage or CD8+ T cells mOS is 20.2 or 18.4 months respectively. Moreover, high density of CD20+ B cells, reflective of presence of TLS, associates with improved OS (mOS NR [high], 11 months [low], p = 0.003). In addition, TLS enriched tumors show an increased level of macrophages expressing PD-L1 in synapsis with CD8+ T cells (activated PD1+ or proliferative Ki67+ T cells).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These findings demonstrate the importance of both tertiary lymphoid structure and high pre-existing innate-adaptive immunity in driving long-term overall survival of durvalumab-treated patients with NSCLC and highlight the need for the development of multiparametric predictive biomarkers beyond tumor-T cell axis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63ed2e8f-a8dc-4568-be10-1b837e9ef279\/@x03B8ZBq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Durvalumab,Image analysis,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12649"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lina Meinecke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge Blando<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Herz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Surace<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Padel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Azqueta Gavaldon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harald Hessel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Farzad Sekhavati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megha Saraiya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anmarie Boutrin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karma Da Costa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaime Rodriguez Canales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashok Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carl Barrett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary Aaron Cooper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ikbel Achour<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Genomic and transcriptomic profiles of patients who progressed within 12 weeks of treatment (&#8220;PD&#8221; patients) were compared to patients who had radiographic stable disease at 12 weeks (&#8220;SD&#8221; patients).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><b><\/b> Genomic profiles were successfully obtained from 19 PD patients and 31 SD patients.

Eight (26%) of the 31 SD patients had alterations either in MTOR (n=5) or PTEN (n=3), that were predicted to have functional impacts on the protein, while only 1 PD patient (5%) had an alteration in either of those 2 genes. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses performed on tissue from 8 patients revealed that SD patients (n=5) exhibited a gene expression signature of &#8220;PTEN loss&#8221; that was absent in PD patients (n=3) (p=0.016).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b><b><\/b> Taken together, these data suggest that alterations in PTEN and MTOR, two key genes of the PI3K signaling pathway, are potential biomarkers for sensitivity to onvansertib\/abi combination in mCRPC patients with early abi-resistance.

A heterologous prime-boost vaccination approach consisting of Chimpanzee Adenovirus (ChAd) prime and multiple self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) boosts, delivering 20 neoantigens, has been evaluated in a Phase 1\/2 clinical trial in late-stage solid tumor patients in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab (NCT03639714). Neoantigen dynamics, tumor burden and genomic correlates of response were studied over time in 20 patients (8 GEA, 2 NSCLC, 10 MSS-CRC). Exome sequences from archival (sample used for neoantigen selection), baseline (start of immunization) and on-treatment biopsies were analyzed for 20, 16 and 10 patients respectively. Paired pre- and post-vaccine tumor transcriptomes were analyzed for 6 patients. Personalized capture baits were designed for all non-synonymous mutations detected in archival biopsies (mean 146; range: 67-402) for ctDNA monitoring. Longitudinal ctDNA samples were collected monthly on treatment (mean 7; range: 1-18). ctDNA duplex UMI libraries were captured and sequenced to a target mean raw depth &#62;80,000x and reduced to 3x per strand consensus duplex reads. The majority of vaccine neoantigens were detected in ctDNA (87%; range 45%-100%) and mean neoantigen variant allele frequency (VAF) strongly correlated with all monitored mutations VAF (R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.90, p &#60; 0.0001) through treatment. The percentage of vaccine neoantigens detected was higher than that for all monitored mutations in the same samples with a median of 80% (21%-98%) in ctDNA and 70% (44%-100%) in biopsies. Five of 9 MSS-CRC patients with measurable baseline ctDNA achieved molecular responses (MR, &#62;50% reduction in ctDNA from baseline) that correlated with OS and PFS, and in some patients, was accompanied by radiologic tumor shrinkage. One MSS-CRC patient with MR for &#62;7 months acquired novel biallelic loss-of-function mutations in TAP1 following 1 year of study treatment. Differential gene expression analysis from paired pre- and post-vaccine biopsies (including 2 MSS-CRC pairs with MR) demonstrated significant upregulation in gene signatures associated with immune-inflamed tumor microenvironments including interferon alpha and gamma responses. We demonstrate that tumor-informed neoantigen selection and vaccine manufacturing while patients receive chemotherapy is feasible, since the majority of neoantigens are retained in the tumor post-chemotherapy. Further, neoantigen-directed immunotherapy appears to drive clinical benefit in patients with advanced MSS-CRC tumors, where CPI alone has provided minimal benefit. Comprehensive ctDNA longitudinal monitoring enables real time assessment of clinical response and acquired resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/96e2a975-e493-436d-b15f-522136ad1e32\/@y03B8ZBr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Neoantigens,Vaccines,Mutation detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12652"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Desiree Schenck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rita Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexis Mantilla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Spiro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor Patch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrienne Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Navarro Gomez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian S.

Clinical and molecular aberration data were retrospectively collected. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the time from treatment initiation to clinical or radiographic disease progression. Overall survival (OS) was the time from diagnosis of metastatic disease to death. Kaplan Meier method and log-rank test were used for survival analysis. A parametric exponential model was implemented for PIK3CA exon analysis to account for small sample size. Pearson correlation coefficient was determined for correlation between PIK3CA and co-mutations. An additional meta-analysis was performed including prior studies of pts with KRAS wild-type (wt) PIK3CA mutant (mut) mCRC receiving anti-EGFR therapy using random effects model.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among 639 pts with mCRC, PIK3CA mutation was positively correlated with KRAS mutation (r=0.11, <i>p<\/i>=0.006) and negatively correlated with TP53 mutation (r=-0.18, <i>p<\/i>=&#60;0.001).

Median PFS between PIK3CA mut and PIK3CA wt pts receiving anti-EGFR therapy was 10.3 versus 7.2 months (<i>p<\/i>=0.6), respectively. Our study and previously published 12 studies from 2005 to 2015 were examined in a meta-analysis where the included studies lacked significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2<\/sup>=0%, <i>p<\/i>=0.6). Among 1047 pts with KRAS wt mCRC who received anti-EGFR therapy, 104 of them were PIK3CA mut. The estimated risk ratio for response to anti-EGFR therapy was 0.77 (95%CI 0.5-1.1) with prediction interval between 0.4 and 1.6.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> PIK3CA mutation has positive correlation with KRAS mutation and negative correlation with TP53 mutation in mCRC. PIK3CA mutation confers a worse prognosis but is not predictive for response to anti-EGFR therapy in pts with KRAS wt mCRC. The latter finding was confirmed in an updated meta-analysis of 13 studies including ours.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9380a5ea-ad36-4489-b9ea-87c4ba2e057f\/@y03B8ZBr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PIK3CA,EGFR,Cetuximab,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12653"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elaine Tan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenyi Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Schell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ibrahim Sahin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Fleming<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todd Knepper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Xie<\/i><\/presenter>.

T cell factor 1 (TCF1) marks and maintains T cell self-renewal while repressing differentiation and has been associated with increased antitumor activity. These findings suggest ICB may depend on the continued availability of self-renewing TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> progenitor T cells as the source of fresh effector cells.<b> <\/b>We hypothesized that characterizing the immunophenotype of T cells in the peripheral blood, with a focus on markers of self-renewal, might be predictive of ICB response. Utilizing an institution-wide biospecimen repository, we evaluated peripheral blood samples using multi-parametric flow cytometry from patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with single-agent ICB who experienced durable clinical benefit (DCB; &#62;1 year of treatment and\/or clinical response &#62;1 year) or primary resistance (RES; &#60;6 months of treatment with evidence of disease progression). Our analysis focused on a CCR7<sup>- <\/sup>T cell subset, which is characterized by lower proportions of TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> cells but increase during active immune responses. We analyzed samples collected from a cohort of 22 patients, 11 of whom had DCB and 11 with RES. In the pre-treatment samples (n=22), we determined that the frequency of TCF1<sup>+<\/sup>CCR7<sup>-<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells was significantly higher in patients with DCB compared to patients with RES (32.6% v. 19.0%; P = 0.0452). Importantly, the median progression free survival was 17.0 months in patients with TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> frequency above the median compared to 3.0 months in patients with TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> frequency below the median (HR 0.43; P = 0.0185). Among the on-treatment samples (n=19), there was an increased frequency of PD1<sup>+ <\/sup>expression within the CCR7<sup>-<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell subset compared to the paired baseline samples. Examination of those therapy-expanded PD1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells revealed differences in the composition of TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> versus TCF1<sup>-<\/sup> fractions in relation to treatment outcome. The mean ratio of TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> to TCF1<sup>-<\/sup> amongst PD1<sup>+<\/sup>CCR7<sup>-<\/sup> T cells on-treatment was found to be significantly higher in the DCB group (1.483 [DCB] v. 0.4791 [RES], P=&#60;0.0001). In this analysis, we identified a pattern of pre-and on-treatment T cell populations that correlates with durable benefit from ICB in patients with NSCLC. We observed that the frequency of TCF1 expression in the more differentiated effector memory T cell subsets prior to treatment correlates with DCB. While on treatment, both groups experienced expansion of PD1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T cells, but the presence of greater fractions of TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the PD1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T cell population correlates with DCB. This finding suggests that persistence and mobilization of self-renewing progenitor T cells is associated with long-lived ICB-induced anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a6ac9b6-98d8-4746-8587-9536261f47ad\/@y03B8ZBr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,Self-renewal,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12654"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rohan Maniar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter H.

More evidence has shown that tRDFs are associated with cancer progression through cell proliferation. In this study, we took advantage of public database and small RNA sequencing to investigate the diagnosis and prognosis potential of tRDFs as a biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer. We collected 1028 patient samples including adenocarcinoma from TCGA, GEO, and plasma. We gathered all fragments upstream sequences and 5&#8217;-tRF, to be categorized as 5&#8217;-tRDF and fragments 3&#8217;-tRF and downstream sequences, to be categorized as 3&#8217;-tRDF. 52 tRDFs were identified that were common in TCGA and GEO, and clustering results separated two GEO with TCGA as distinct expression pattern. 11 differentially expressed tRDFs were screened out from the GEO data and exhibited excellent diagnostic value. The AUC of two independent validations was up to 0.90. Six tRDFs, 5P_tRNA-Gly-TCC-1-1, 5a_tRF-Ile-AAT\/GAT, 3P_tRNA-Arg-TCG-1-1, and 3P_tRNA-Arg-TCT-4-1, 5P_tRNA-Asn-GTT-2-3, 5a_tRF-Asp-GTC, were named as tRDF signatures and exhibited the same excellent diagnosis ability, and combination had better performance than individual tRDFs. Plasma data validated the diagnostic characteristics of two signatures, 3P_tRNA-Arg-TCG-1-1 and 5P_tRNA-Asn-GTT-2-3, that could serve as novel diagnostic biomarkers. We investigated the relationship between signatures and prognosis by stages and following-up times in TCGA-LUAD. 5a_tRF-Ile-AAT\/GAT were identified to be a significant prognostic value with survival time on 36 months and 24 months among early stages patients. 3P_tRNA-Arg-TCT-4-1 was identified to associate with survival outcome within 12 and six months in early stages. We also assessed the role of tRDFs in transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. 3&#8217;-tRDFs showed more correlation with miRNA than 5&#8217;-tRDFs. A correlation analysis showed signatures, 5a_tRF-Asp-GTC, dominated the most correlation with miRNAs. Enrichment results of six tRDFs signatures presented PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and endocytosis signaling pathways are associated with tRDF target miRNAs. We also analyzed the signaling pathway characteristic of the six signatures tRDFs-target genes and found the tRDFs correlated genes are significantly activated in the cell cycle, oocyte meiosiss. Five signatures were assessed to associate with PD-L1 immune checkpoint and correlated with the genes that targets in PD-L1 checkpoint signaling pathway. Our study is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of tRDFs as biomarkers in lung cancer, investigating the diagnostic and prognostic values of tRDFs, and demonstrated their biological function and transcriptional role as well as potential immune therapeutic value. This work highlights the potential clinical utility of tRDFs in lung cancer therapy and provides evidence of tRDF-target treatment in lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb6790d8-4e02-4554-bc3b-9522edcc9c52\/@y03B8ZBr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,tRNA-derived fragment ,Diagnostic marker,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12655"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zitong Gao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mayumi Jijiwa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masaki Nasu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather Borgard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinwen Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ting Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaoqiu Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuanyuan Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youping Deng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Immunotherapy with checkpoint blockers has shown outstanding benefits in a subset of NSCLC patients, which are not accurately identified due to the lack of robust biomarkers of response.<br \/>We hypothesize that specific molecular alterations of NSCLC tumor cells impact the immune microenvironment. Defining this association could improve the prediction of response to immunotherapy. This work aims to identify a multiparametric biomarker signature. We studied 178 tumor samples from a cohort of early stage NSCLC with complete clinical annotation. We analyzed their molecular aberrations, calculated their Tumor Mutational Burden and described their immune landscape by immunohistochemistry and a dedicated RNAseq panel. We defined novel subgroups of NSCLC tumors with specific immune, molecular and clinical features, showing an association between their molecular genotype and immune phenotype. Based on these data, subgroups were proposed as pro-immunogenic, pro-tumorigenic or mixed. Adenocarcinomas clustered in 4 groups. The pro-tumorigenic group had a significant higher proportion of alterations in <i>ARID1A, FGF10, ROS1<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>. One pro-immunogenic group had a significant higher proportion of <i>MET<\/i> alterations and lower proportion of <i>EGFR<\/i> alterations. An immune mixed group significantly accrued never smokers and had no alterations in <i>FGF10<\/i>. Squamous cell carcinomas clustered in 4 groups. The pro-tumorigenic group had a significant higher proportion of alterations in <i>CCND1, FGF3, FGF10, FGF19, NOTCH1<\/i>, <i>PIK3CA, PIK3CB<\/i>, <i>TFRC<\/i>. A pro-immunogenic group had a significant higher infiltration of T CD4<sup>+<\/sup>, T CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and B cells and a higher overall survival. Another pro-immunogenic group had a significant absence of <i>MYCN<\/i> and <i>NF1<\/i> alterations. Taken together we identified a set of candidate predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy in NSCLC. Genes overexpressed in pro-immunogenic tumors are related to adaptive immune response stimulation (<i>CD28, FCRLA, JCHAIN, LY9, MS4A1, SLAMF7, TNFRSF9, TNFRSF17<\/i>), antigen presentation (<i>CD1C, CD1D, HLA-A<\/i>), apoptosis (<i>FAS<\/i>), immune chemotaxis (<i>CCL20, CCR4, CCR6<\/i>), and immune regulation (<i>CD53, PDCD1, SH2D1A, ZAP70<\/i>). On the other hand, genes upregulated in pro-tumorigenic tumors are involved in angiogenesis (<i>VEGFA<\/i>), cell cycle regulation (<i>BUB1, CCNB2, FOXM1, MAD2L1, TOP2A<\/i>), cell growth\/survival (<i>IGF1R<\/i>), DNA replication\/repair (<i>KIAA0101<\/i>) and iron metabolism (<i>HMBS, TFRC<\/i>). These findings are being validated by Digital Spatial Profiling in a cohort of patients with advanced stage NSCLC that were treated with checkpoint blockers. If confirmed, these results could remarkably improve patient selection and the benefit upon immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/89f04802-5113-47b3-97c7-f6219b934e3f\/@y03B8ZBr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Predictive biomarkers,Multiomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12659"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Javier Ramos-Paradas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Gomez-Sanchez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aranzazu Rosado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alvaro Conrado Ucero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nuria Carrizo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Belen Enguita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Teresa Muñoz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Esther Conde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Paz-Ares<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Maria Garrido-Martin<\/i><\/presenter>.

In 2021, the FDA approved two &#945;PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for addition to fluoropyrimidine\/platinum-containing CTX in this first-line setting. As ICI+CTX enters the clinic, understanding ICI responses and predicting which patients will benefit from ICI addition are key challenges. To address these challenges, we assessed clinical and molecular profiles from the experimental LUD2015-005 trial (NCT02735239, EudraCT 2015-005298-19). Treatment consisted of an initial four-week ICI-only window with durvalumab (&#945;PD-L1) with or without a single dose of tremelimumab (&#945;CTLA-4), followed by 6 cycles of ICI+CTX (CapOx). 38 inoperable patients received treatment (35 EAC; 3 ESCC); median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 13.4 and 9.3 months, respectively. All patients reported at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), with 29 (76.3%) reporting grade 3 or higher TEAEs. EAC patients with available samples (n = 33) were taken forward for biomarker analysis, using tumor and adjacent normal biopsies collected at pre-treatment (PreTx), after four weeks of ICI-only (ICI-4W), and at the end of ICI+CTX (PostTx).<br \/>Transcriptomic comparison of paired PreTx and ICI-4W EAC biopsies (n = 28) revealed ICI-induced upregulation of a novel T-cell inflammation signature (termed INCITE). Stronger INCITE upregulation correlated with greater tumor shrinkage during the ICI-only window, and tumors with minimal INCITE upregulation showed markers of ICI resistance, including Innate PD-1 Resistance (IPRES). Despite correlation with ICI-only responses, INCITE changes were not associated with overall ICI+CTX outcomes.<br \/>To find predictive biomarkers of ICI+CTX outcomes, we conducted comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic profiling of PreTx EAC biopsies (n = 33). First, we generated a novel 65,000 cell scRNA-seq dataset and designed a deconvolution workflow to resolve tumor cell composition. Unexpectedly, monocyte composition was strongly linked with greater overall survival (OS) (HR: 0.40 [0.23-0.69]; p = 0.001; FDR = 0.047). Coding tumor mutational burden (TMB) was also associated with improved OS (HR: 0.50 [0.28-0.89]; p = 0.019). Multivariate modelling suggested monocyte composition and TMB were independent and complementary predictors of outcomes. Neither factor was associated with outcomes in a TCGA cohort of EAC patients not treated with ICI, suggesting these biomarkers may be specific to ICI or ICI+CTX.<br \/>Our findings suggest monocyte composition and TMB may identify EAC patients likely to benefit from ICI+CTX. INCITE upregulation may also serve as a useful monitor of ICI efficacy. These timely findings further our understanding of ICI response and resistance and may help inform patient selection for ICI+CTX.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d4530eb9-2c3c-48ae-b357-93297ae5372b\/@y03B8ZBr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Predictive biomarkers,Molecular profiling,Durvalumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12661"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"6bc798b6-6a22-4498-824b-1c3e1e87416a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6bc798b6-6a22-4498-824b-1c3e1e87416a\/@y03B8ZBr\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thomas M.

We sought to evaluate pre-treatment MSI-H endometrial tumor samples to examine cell subpopulation differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with resistance to pembrolizumab.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Archival tumor samples from MSI-H endometrial cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab at MD Anderson Cancer Center were obtained under an IRB-approved protocol. Twenty-one patients were identified, and pre-treatment archival tumor samples were collected and submitted for RNA-seq and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) with an optimized 38-antibody panel to identify predictive immuno-genomic signatures and cell subpopulations associated with treatment response.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among the 21 patients treated with pembrolizumab, there were 14 responders and 7 non-responders. Based on transcriptomic signatures, TME heterogeneity was observed. The 14 responders consisted of samples with immunologically &#8220;hot&#8221; (5\/5; 100%), &#8220;cold&#8221; (6\/8; 75%), and &#8220;warm&#8221; TMEs (3\/8; 37.5%) while the 7 non-responders consisted of only &#8220;cold&#8221; (2\/8; 25%) and &#8220;warm&#8221; (5\/8; 62.5%) TME samples. There was an enrichment of fibroblasts and endothelial cell transcriptomic signatures in the samples of the non-responders compared to responders (p=0.018) with a trend of increasing enrichment in those signatures as response strength decreased. IMC performed on archival tissue from 20 patients demonstrated similar trend of higher population of activated fibroblasts (SMA<sup>+<\/sup>, MFAP5<sup>+<\/sup>) and endothelial cells (CD31<sup>+<\/sup>) in non-responders. Furthermore, non-responders had significantly higher total regulatory T cells (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FOXP3<sup>+<\/sup>) in the tumor (p=0.027) and stroma (p=0.0282) compared to responders. Additionally, significantly higher activated regulatory T cells (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FOXP3<sup>+<\/sup>CD25<sup>+<\/sup>) were observed in the tumor (p=0.016) and stroma (p=0.008) of non-responders compared to responders. Similar abundance of total and subpopulations of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were observed between responders and non-responders.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The MSI-H endometrial TME is heterogeneous. Increased presence of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and regulatory T-cells in the TME correlate with innate resistance to pembrolizumab. Treatment aimed toward the reduction of these cellular subpopulations may improve sensitivity to PD-1 inhibitors. Future studies are needed to validate these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1014c0eb-179a-419d-9b71-e0eda5042a8f\/@y03B8ZBr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Endometrial cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20909"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeffrey A.

However, identifying the right patients for these therapies across multiple disease types remains a challenge. In ovarian cancer, genomic-scar based measures for homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) are approved diagnostics (genome-wide LOH [gLOH] and genomic instability score [GIS]); however, broader utility has not been established.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A pan-cancer genomic profiling dataset (n = 202,472; Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) was split 70:30 for training and validation of an HRD signature using an XGB machine learning model (mlHRD). A broad set of copy number (Macintyre 2018) and indel features (Alexandrov 2020) were used to identify signatures of HRD. gLOH (Coleman 2017) and GIS (Timms 2014) were calculated using copy number profiles. Biallelic alterations were predicted using a computational zygosity algorithm (Sun, 2018). The nationwide, de-identified Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine ovarian and prostate clinico-genomic databases (FH-FMI CGDB) were utilized for outcomes analysis. The de-identified data originated from approximately 280 US cancer clinics (~800 sites of care). Time to therapy discontinuation (TTD) was estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Hazard ratios were calculated using unadjusted Cox proportional Hazard models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We developed an algorithm to predict HRD status using indel and copy number features (see methods). Across the pan-cancer dataset, the rate of mlHRD was 6.4% with the highest frequency in fallopian tube (30%), ovarian (30%), peritoneal (23%), breast (16%), and prostate cancers (15%). Sensitivity to detect biallelic <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> alterations was high across tumors [ovary (93%), prostate (87%), breast (85%), pancreas (80%)]. Beyond <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>, mlHRD positivity was associated with biallelic alterations in <i>RAD51D <\/i>(OR = 24, p&#60;1E-10), <i>PALB2 <\/i>(OR = 23, p&#60;1E-10), <i>BARD1 <\/i>(OR = 23, p&#60;1E-10), and<i> RAD51C <\/i>(OR = 19, p&#60;1E-10). In the FH-FMI CGDB ovarian cancer cohort, 150 patients were treated with PARPi (mlHRD positive = 73; negative = 77); mlHRD positivity was associated with improved TTD (median 8.9 mo v 3.9 mo; HR = 0.49 [0.34-0.71], p &#60; 0.001), with similar predictive power to gLOH &#62;16% (HR = 0.55 [0.38-0.79], p = 0.001) and GIS &#62;42 (HR = 0.59 [0.41-0.86], p = 0.006). For 62 patients with prostate cancer treated with PARPi (mlHRD positive = 27; negative = 35), mlHRD was associated with prolonged TTD on PARPi (median 6.8 mo v 3.4 mo; HR = 0.56 [0.30-1.03], p = 0.064), trending more predictive than gLOH &#62;8.29% (Sokol 2020) and GIS &#62;42 (HR = 0.64 [0.29-1.40] and 0.80 [0.37-1.73], respectively; p&#62;0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These findings suggest that HRD is associated with genomic scarring beyond ovarian cancer.

However, HRR\/MMR alteration and response for 1L FOLFOX chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) is not fully understood.<br \/>Methods: From 2017 to 2021, a number of 1,225 advanced CRC patients with available HRR\/MRR alteration data were registered in K-MASTER project. After excluding missing data, adjuvant chemotherapy alone, other chemotherapeutic regimen, 390 patients who received 1L FOLFOX chemotherapy were finally analyzed. Targeted sequencing was conducted using Cancer Scan panel, FIRST panel, and K-MASTER Cancer (v1.0 or v1.1) panel for tumor tissue. If tumor tissue was not available, liquid biopsy was performed. HRR gene defined as follow; ATM, ATR, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FANCA, FANCD2, FANCG, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51. MMR gene defined as below; MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6, POLE, ARID1A.<br \/>Results: Among 340 patients, 79 patients harbored HRR\/MMR alteration. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 5.6 months vs 5.7 months in HRR\/MMR alteration and wild-type group, respectively (hazard ratio (HR)=1.19, p-value=0.21). The median overall survival (OS) was comparable between two group (40.6 months vs 34.5 months, respectively; HR=0.71, p-value=0.17). Multivariate cox-proportional hazard model also showed HRR\/MRR alteration status was not an independent factor for both PFS and OS (Both p-value&#62;0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: Patients harbored HRR\/MRR alteration may not be sensitive for 1L oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy than wild-type.

However, most patients receiving ICB do not derive benefit. Therefore, there is a crucial need to identify reliable predictive biomarkers of response to anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 agents, both to develop precision medicine in cancer immunotherapy and to better understand mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance. One pathway that plays an important role in the regulation of immune cell reactivity is L-Arginine (Arg) metabolism, which is essential to T-cell activation. We therefore aimed at evaluating the association of baseline plasmatic level of Arg - serving as a surrogate of Arginase (Arg1) activity - and clinical benefit to ICB.<br \/>Methods: Correlation with Arg levels and efficacy of ICB in the pre-clinical setting was assessed by using a syngeneic mouse model of colorectal cancer (MC38) known to be responsive to ICB. Correlation of Arg levels and clinical activity of ICB was assessed by analyzing the plasma samples obtained before treatment onset in two independent cohorts of patient with advanced cancer and included in two institutional molecular profiling programs (discovery cohort: BIP, NCT02534649, n=77; validation cohort: PREMIS, n=295, NCT03984318). In addition, using matched PBMCs-plasma samples, we analyzed the correlation between Arg level and features of PBMCs that were captured through multiplexed-flow cytometry analysis.<br \/>Results: As expected, treatment of MC38-tumor bearing mice with anti-PD(L)1 antibodies demonstrated a strong anti-tumor effect with tumor rejection observed for app. 40% of mice (11 out of 28). The tumor rejection rate was significantly higher in mice with high baseline Arg level than in mice with low Arg level: 85.7% versus 23.8%, p=0.004. In both discovery and validation cohorts, low Arg level at baseline (42 &#60;&#181;mol\/L) was significantly associated with worse clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis showed that low baseline Arg level isd an independent prognostic factor for both PFS and OS. Finally, PBMCs immunophenotyping showed that low Arg level was significantly associated with increased PDL1 expression in several immune cell subsets from the myeloid lineage.<br \/>Conclusions: Altogether, our results demonstrate that baseline Arg levels are highly predictive of ICB efficacy. Increase in PDL1 expression in myeloid cells upon Arg deprivation could partly underly its suppressive activity. Plasmatic Arg quantification can therefore represent an attractive biomarker to tailor novel therapeutic regimens targeting the Arginase pathway in combination with ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68582f17-5d20-46a6-a5ad-63e129f7855d\/@z03B8ZBs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12665"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jean-Philippe Guegan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florent Peyraud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurelien Marabelle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathalie Chaput<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominique Bodet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laure Fontan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Gaultier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Imane NAFIA<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francois-Xavier Danlos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Planchard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Robert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Even<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed Khettab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lambros Tselikas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luc Friboulet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Charles Soria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabrice Andre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabrice Barlesi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alban Bessede<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Italiano<\/i><\/presenter>.
