[{"Abstract":"<b>Objective:<\/b> Recently, lymph node ratio (LNR) has emerged as an alternative to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) N stage, with superior prognostic value. The utility of LNR in Middle Eastern Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains unknown. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed a large cohort of 1407 PTC patients for clinico-pathological associations of LNR.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to determine the cut-off for LNR. We also performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine whether LNR or AJCC N stage was superior in predicting recurrence in PTC.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Based on ROC curve analysis, a cut-off of 0.15 was chosen for LNR. High LNR was significantly associated with adverse clinico-pathological characteristics such as male sex, extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, multifocality, bilateral tumors, T4 tumors, lateral lymph node (N1b) involvement, distant metastasis, advanced tumor stage, ATA high risk category and tumor recurrence. On multivariate analysis, we found that LNR was a better predictor of tumor recurrence than AJCC N stage (Odds ratio: 1.96 vs. 1.30; p value: 0.0184 vs. 0.3831). We also found that LNR combined with TNM stage and ATA risk category improved the prediction of recurrence-free survival, compared to TNM stage or ATA risk category alone.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The present study suggests LNR is an independent predictor of recurrence in Middle Eastern PTC. Integration of LNR with 8<sup>th<\/sup> edition AJCC TNM staging system and ATA risk stratification will improve the accuracy to predict recurrence in Middle Eastern PTC and help in tailoring treatment and surveillance strategies in these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f32f1369-327f-444c-9b74-45794343a129\/@s03B8ZQw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Lymph node metastasis,Recurrence,Lymph node ratio,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17531"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sandeep K.

However, PTC recurrence is relatively common in loco-regional and distant sites. Although multifocality is a common occurrence in PTC, its prognostic impact remains controversial. In addition, data on prevalence and prognostic significance of multifocality in PTC from Middle Eastern ethnicity is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of multifocality in PTC larger than 1cm and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) in our center.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A cohort of 1515 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Aggressive histopathologic variants of PTC were excluded to avoid their potential confounding effect on clinical outcomes. We identified 1087 patients who had PTC with primary tumor exceeding 1cm and 150 patients with PTMC, with medium follow up of 9.2 years. In each group, we compared patients with unifocal and multifocal disease. Clinico-pathological and molecular correlations were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relation between multifocal tumors and lymph node metastasis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The incidence of multifocality in PTC larger than 1cm was 48.3% (525\/1087), whereas it was 38.7% (58\/150) in PTMCs. In patients with PTC &#62; 1cm, multifocality was significantly associated with aggressive markers such as extrathyroidal extension (p &#60; 0.0001), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.0047), lymph node (LN) metastasis (p = 0.0006), distant metastasis (p = 0.0305) and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutation (p = 0.0113). In analogous analysis of patients with PTMC, multifocality was significantly associated with extrathyroidal extension (p &#60; 0.0001), LN metastasis (p = 0.0005) and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutation (p = 0.0006). In both sub-groups, disease recurrence and overall survival did not differ between unifocal and multifocal group. Multivariate analysis showed that multifocality was an independent predictor of LN metastasis (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00 - 1.71; p = 0.0472 for PTC &#62; 1cm and OR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.00 - 3.54; p = 0.0491 for PTMC).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Tumor multifocality is frequently observed in Middle Eastern PTC and PTMC and is a predictive factor for LN metastasis in PTC. Given the predictive value of multifocality in Middle Eastern ethnicity, aggressive therapy and intensive follow-up should be considered for both PTC and PTMC with multifocality. Regional LN metastasis should be closely monitored and prophylactic central lymph node dissection could be considered in these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7154fa76-599b-4c9b-9639-05f621560a37\/@t03B8ZQx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid\/endocrine-related cancers,Metastasis,BRAF,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17532"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pratheeshkumar Poyil<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdul K Siraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandeep Kumar Parvathareddy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Divya Padmaja<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saravanan Thangavel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rafia Begum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roxanne Diaz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khadija Al-Obaisi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khawla S.
