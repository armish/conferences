[{"Abstract":"<b>BACKGROUND:<\/b> Syngeneic mouse tumor models are widely used as preclinical models for immuno-oncology (I\/O) research. However, their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) <i>in vivo<\/i> is limited, despite the increase in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which is potentially due to low intrinsic immunogenicity. Expression of chicken ovalbumin (OVA) engineered into syngeneic tumors has previously been shown to render the cells more immunogenic and increases the response to ICIs such as anti-PD-1. In this study we investigated the potential to increase the response to ICIs through OVA expression and characterized the model for TILs and T cell-mediated immunity compared with parent cell line.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b> A series of murine cells were transduced by lentiviral vector (pLVX-EF1a_IRES-PURO) with a chicken OVA coding cDNA. OVA expression was confirmed by western blot following single clone selection under puromycin. MC38-OVA, B16-F10-OVA, CT26.WT-OVA and EMT6-OVA cells were subcutaneously inoculated into immunocompetent C57BL\/6 or BALB\/c mice to evaluate the tumorigenicity and their <i>in vivo<\/i> response to anti-PD-1(10mg\/kg, IP) treatment. In the study, blood, spleen and tumors were collected at termination for FACS analysis of the immune cell populations and the OVA-specific T cells. The effects of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte depletion was investigated using anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies in the PD-1 cured EMT6-OVA mice. Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) was evaluated by re-challenge studies in both OVA expressing and WT tumor-bearing mice with isolated T cells derived from OVA untreated mice, anti-PD-1 cured mice or OT-I mice.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b> Anti-PD-1 treatment resulted in complete regression in most mice bearing CT26.WT-OVA, MC38-OVA and EMT6-OVA, whereas an improvement in the response was shown in B16-F10-OVA <i>in vivo<\/i>. T cell and NK cells expansion was observed after anti-PD-1 treatment in peripheral blood with increased T cells, Treg cells and NK cells in both tumor-draining lymph nodes and spleen. In the re-challenge study anti-PD-1 cured mice generated robust tumor specific memory T cell, which successfully inhibited OVA expressing tumor growth following ACT. CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from EMT6-OVA-bearing mice showed anti-tumor immunity <i>in vivo<\/i>. CD4 and CD8 depletion studies provided further insight into the T cell role in PD-1 treatment.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS: <\/b> The panel of OVA expressing murine cell lines displayed increased T cell-mediated immunity and enhanced anti-PD-1 responses compared to WT models for different cancer indications <i>in vivo<\/i>, providing novel immunogenic syngeneic models for preclinical immunotherapy evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c2e4dd29-78aa-4acd-876e-02f431627133\/@C03B8ZGM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Immune checkpoint,Mouse models,Adoptive immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17091"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chenpan Nie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jia Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annie X.

Upregulated NLRP3 inflammasome innate immune pathway is of importance to tumor development. Current efforts are being focused on identifying small molecules that exhibit anti-cancer activity as inflammasome pathway inhibitors. Our previously published work on phenstatin based indole linked chalcone scaffold <b>9a<\/b> with 1-methyl, 2- and 3-methoxy substituents in the aromatic ring revealed <b>9a<\/b> as an anti-oral cancer compound. <b>9a<\/b> was found to act through inhibiting tubulin polymerization at protein level, using in vitro models oral cancer cell line\/ spheroid cells and in vivo animal oral cancer xenograft model. <b>9a<\/b> had also shown significant reduction in radiolabeled-glucose uptake in xenograft mice model. Current study was undertaken to evaluate if small molecule inhibitor <b>9a<\/b> acts through regulating the NLRP3 pathway. Using computation approach, we predicted the binding of <b>9a<\/b> with NLRP3<sup>NACHT<\/sup> domain, which revealed stable interaction as similar to that exhibited by NLRP3 inhibitors MCC950 and ADP. Further, we checked immune mechanistic activity of <b>9a<\/b> on NLRP3 pathway intermediates in oral cancer cells. AW13516 cell line which was human tongue squamous tumor-derived cell line; indigenously developed at our department previously, was activated for NLRP3 inflammasome pathway using LPS and activator Nigericin in presence of <b>9a<\/b>. MCC950 treated cells and only LPS or LPS\/ Nigericin treated cells served as controls. NLRP3, caspase-1 and mitochondrial protein expression was analyzed in these cells by immunofluorescence (IF) and found to be increased upon LPS\/ NIG activation and reduced significantly upon MCC950 and <b>9a<\/b> treatment. Activation led to puncta formation which was found diffused after MCC950\/ <b>9a<\/b> treatment. Similarly treated AW13516 cells were also validated using western blotting experiments. Expression of 118kDa NLRP3 protein was found increased upon inflammasome activation that was significantly reduced in <b>9a<\/b> treated cells and reduction was dose dependent. <b>9a<\/b> had shown significant reduction in oral cancer xenograft of AW13516 in NOD-SCID mice model. We tested formalin-fixed paraffin sections of these tumors by immunohistochemistry. Tumor areas were assessed for expression of NLRP3 pathway markers and there was significant reduction in NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD and IL-1&#946; in <b>9a<\/b> treated tumors compared to control tumors. This reduction was at par with that shown by Adriamycin. Summarizingly, <b>9a<\/b> has been found to be regulating inflammatory immune mechanisms and can be developed further as immunomodulatory anti-cancer agent. Since macrophages are major resource immune cells of NLRP3, further studies are underway to test <b>9a<\/b> on macrophages from nlrp3-\/- and caspase-\/- mice in comparison with normal mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b97b9da-0aad-440d-a920-1b346332c55c\/@C03B8ZGM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Small molecule inhibitor,Oral cancers,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jyoti Kode<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jitendra Maharana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>K.

ICs have gained significant interest in recent years and several antibody-cytokine fusion proteins have entered clinical trials. Compared to recombinant fusion proteins, we have developed an entirely different approach to IC generation based on the site-specific, chemical conjugation of synthetic cytokines to antibodies. Bright Peak generates enhanced and conjugatable cytokines using a novel protein engineering platform based on solid-phase peptide synthesis and subsequent chemical ligation of protein segments. Our synthetic cytokines can then be readily chemically conjugated to specific lysine residues in the Fc region of an existing IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 antibody without the need for prior antibody engineering. Chemical conjugation of cytokine payloads is rapid, enabling the flexible generation of ICs based on different antibodies and payloads within weeks. We applied our technology to more than 10 antibodies and found that neither antigen binding nor payload potency and selectivity are affected by chemical conjugation. Importantly, binding of the Fc domain of ICs to Fc gamma receptors or FcRn is not significantly affected. We are initially focusing on the development of PD-1-targeted ICs to achieve dual-targeting of PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> effector T cells (cis-signaling). Using several anti-PD-1 antibodies and various synthetic IL-2 variants as payloads, we created ICs with different drug-antibody ratios and explored alternative conjugation sites within the Fc region. Resulting PD-1\/IL-2 ICs are highly active showing significantly enhanced potency due to avidity resulting from binding of the cytokine to PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> effector T cells in cis. Our PD-1\/IL-2 ICs induce strong pharmacodynamic effects in vivo, and we are currently optimizing the pharmacological profiles of PD-1-targeted ICs for clinical application. In addition, we are actively exploring cis-signaling ICs targeting different surface receptors and immune cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/39124a38-3d93-4ad2-a62d-1bd4cae2ea65\/@C03B8ZGM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,PD-1,Interleukin-2,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17093"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jean-Philippe Carralot<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matilde Arévalo Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Tam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Armentani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vijaya R.

Wild-type IL-2 acts via binding to the medium-affinity IL-2 receptor &#946;&#947; (IL2R&#946;&#947;) expressed in CD8+ T effector cells and NK cells. At the same time, its efficacy is dampened due to strong activation of regulatory T cells (Treg) expressing the high-affinity IL-2 receptor &#945;&#946;&#947; (IL2R&#945;&#946;&#947;). Furthermore, binding to CD25\/IL2R&#945; on endothelial cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells is thought to be involved in the induction of severe toxicity including vascular leak syndrome (VLS). In addition, aldesleukin exhibits a very short half-life that, combined with its safety risks, requires a burdensome inpatient treatment schedule. We set out to rationally design a variant of human IL-2 that addresses and overcomes the major limitations of aldesleukin. Using our chemical protein synthesis technology, we introduced select modified amino acids including site-specific chemical conjugation handles to optimize the properties of IL-2 for cancer therapy while maintaining high homology to the wild-type IL-2 sequence. Bright Peak&#8217;s enhanced cytokine shows increased binding to CD122\/IL2R&#946; and does not interact with CD25\/IL2R&#945; to improve safety and prevent the preferential activation of Tregs compared to CD8+ T effector cells. Site-specific conjugation to a 30 kDa PEG for half-life extension resulted in the generation of BPT-143, which is equipotent to aldesleukin in activating CD8+ T cells in vitro. In mice, BPT-143 induces a strong expansion of CD8+ T cells with only transient and minor effects on Tregs in vivo and exhibits improved PK properties allowing for a convenient dosing schedule. In the syngeneic CT26 tumor model, BPT-143 showed strong anti-tumor efficacy as a single agent as well as enhanced efficacy in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. BPT-143 induced a 55% complete response rate and, upon tumor re-challenge, all cured animals rejected CT26 tumor cells indicating the development of immunologic memory. In multiple-dose PK\/PD studies in non-human primates (NHP), BPT-143 was well tolerated and induced robust and repeated expansion of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ conventional T cells and NK cells while showing only negligible effects on Tregs and eosinophils. Both <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy studies in murine tumor models as well as PD effects observed in NHP indicate that BPT-143 has a best-in-class profile among &#8220;not-alpha&#8221; IL-2 compounds currently in development.

Binding of IL-2 in a dimeric complex with intermediate affinity or in the high affinity trimeric complex, which also includes IL-2R&#945; and is predominantly expressed on antigen activated T cells and Tregs leads to trans-phosphorylation of signaling motifs on the IL-2R&#946; and IL-2R&#947; intracellular domains by the associated JAK kinases. The function of the wild type IL-2 is to bring the receptor chains in close proximity to produce an optimal level of phosphorylation and activation of associated STAT transcription factors. Here we established a way to bring IL-2R&#946; and IL-2R&#947; chains together in a cytokine-independent manner that results in functional activation.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures:<\/b> Human IL-2R&#946; and IL-2R&#947; specific heavy chain single domain antibodies (VHH) were generated by camel immunization and screening of VHH libraries prepared from peripheral blood cells for binding.

In particular, colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant neoplasm in Chile and according to the WHO, represents the second cause of death from tumors in the world, which is why there is a need to study new strategies for future therapies, like the immunotherapy aimed at inhibiting the immune checkpoints, as Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) receptor in T-cell, that interact with his ligand (PD-L1) in the tumor. However, there is a percentage of patients who don't respond to this therapy, making it necessary to search for alternative or adjuvant treatments. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a mainly cytoplasmic protein, is involved in several cellular processes including the immune response, being involve in tumor progression. Specifically, it has been observed that HDAC6 stimulates STAT3 activity, a transcription factor involved in immunogenicity, which plays a role as a transcriptional inducer of different genes in these pathways, as PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1). The over-expression of PD-L1 on some cancer cells promotes inhibition of T lymphocyte activation which reduces the immune response. Therefore, we will focus on pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 in CRC cell due to its potential as adjuvants to avoid immunotolerance in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we investigate whether HDAC6 affects STAT3 activation in CRC cells, through treatments with Nexturastat A (NextA), a specific HDAC6 inhibitor, that indirectly, decreases the levels of activating post-translational modifications on STAT3 analyzed by Western blot and flow cytometry. In the same context, we analyze by RT-qPCR the decrease in the expression of IL-10 and PD-L1 after NextA treatment. Then to emulate an inflammatory environment, we treat the cells with Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and then with NextA, observing the changes described above over the STAT3 modification and activity. Finally, through a RNAseq assay with the last conditions, showed a reduced the expression of other genes involved in immunomodulatory pathways. These results suggest that treatments with specific HDAC6 inhibitors would reduce the functionality of STAT3 in CRC cells, impacting the expression of immunomodulator genes involved in the immune response, as IL-10, PD-L1 and others. Therefore, the use of specific HDAC6 inhibitors may be a reasonable and an interesting adjuvant strategy for help in checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapy, since HDAC6 inhibitors would indirectly decrease PD-L1 expression, one of the checkpoint inhibitors of immune system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f3d3c1d-9d8c-471a-9944-e7e21d2010e3\/@C03B8ZGM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT),Immunomodulation,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17095"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Constanza Mardones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camila Navarrete<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Estrella Armijo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fernando Rivas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Matias Ignacio Hepp<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This <i>de novo<\/i> protein signals through the IL-2R&#946;\/&#611; complex in an IL-2R&#945;-independent fashion, supporting immune function of both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In syngeneic tumor models of solid tumors, NL-201 demonstrates marked antitumor activity through multiple mechanisms of action, including upregulation of granzyme B in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Here, we further explored the therapeutic potential of NL-201 in preclinical models of B cell malignancies. In cell-based studies, NL-201 augmented antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of Toledo DLBCL (diffuse large B cell lymphoma) cells incubated with human NK cells and CD20 antibodies. Importantly, direct activation by NL-201 was specific to NK cells and did not impact STAT5 phosphorylation nor proliferation of the tested malignant cells. The administration of NL-201 monotherapy in mice bearing A20 B cell lymphoma syngeneic tumors yielded robust inhibition of tumor growth. Tumor xenografts from implanted Pfeiffer cells have also been evaluated to understand the activity of NL-201 in a model closely resembling DLBCL physiology. In summary, NL-201 is active as a single agent and in combination with CD20-targeted therapies <i>in vitro<\/i>, as well as demonstrating monotherapy activity in <i>in vivo<\/i> preclinical models of B cell malignancies as well as in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. The NL-201 enhancement of cytotoxicity by CD8+ T cells and NK cells supports additional exploration aimed at optimizing combinatorial approaches. These findings will inform the design of planned clinical studies with NL-201 in patients with B-cell lymphomas and other hematological malignancies.<b><u><\/u><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2bd1af4f-d830-4d2f-9073-3a0a2487bee5\/@C03B8ZGM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Immunotherapy,Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17096"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justin Huard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christie Mortales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Swanson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carl Walkey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bill Arthur<\/i><\/presenter>.

Enoblituzumab (also known as MGA271 or TJ271) is an investigational, Fc-optimized monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3 and exhibits enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated killing of B7-H3 expressing cancer cells. Here we identified the immuno-modulatory function of TJ271 in different cell subsets and pathways as a new mechanism for cancer treatment.<br \/><b>Experiments:<\/b> The function of B7-H3 and TJ271 in regulating immune response was investigated in human PBMCs stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody with or without plate-coated B7-H3 in the presence or absence of TJ271. Gene expression profiles and immunophenotyping of PBMCs after treatments were evaluated by Nanostring nCounter platform and CyTOF mass cytometry, respectively. IFN-&#947; production from cell supernatant was measured by ELISA. <i>In vitro<\/i> tumor killing activity by TJ271 and urelumab, a 4-1BB agonist, was evaluated by co-culture of B7-H3 expressing tumor cells and PBMCs stimulated with anti-CD3. The tumor cell killing activity was evaluated by 7-AAD staining on the Incucyte platform.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Gene expression of cell lineage markers in antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages and neutrophils was induced, while those in natural killer (NK) cells was suppressed by B7-H3 stimulation, respectively. Furthermore, expression of activation markers and co-stimulatory receptors, including IFN&#947;, ULBP2, GITR, and 4-1BB, was down-regulated while expression of exhaustion markers in CD8+ T cells and NK cells, including PD-L1, PD-L2, and IDO1, and of genes associated with M2-like macrophages were up-regulated by B7-H3. All this B7-H3-induced differential gene expression pattern was reversed by TJ271 treatment. As revealed by CyTOF, TJ271 treatment abolished B7-H3-mediated increase in the frequency of M2-like monocytes (B7-H3+CD68+CD206+CD16<sup>lo<\/sup> or B7-H3-CD68+CD163+CD16+) and led to increased frequency of 4-1BB-expressing CD4, CD8, and NK cells. TJ271 exhibited strong tumor killing activity against ES-2, a B7-H3-expressing ovarian cancer cell line <i>in vitro<\/i>. Consistent with the TJ271-associated increased 4-1BB expression in T and NK cells, activation of 4-1BB by urelumab further enhanced TJ271-mediated tumor killing activity.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data confirm the immunosuppressive function of B7H3 and demonstrate the immunoregulatory function of TJ271 as evidenced by the activation of cytolytic T cell and NK cells, reinvigoration of exhausted cells, and suppression of M2-like myeloid cells. These findings provide rationale for combination therapy with blockade of B7-H3 by TJ271 with other immunotherapies to achieve increased clinical efficacy against cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ab8ff379-10ae-4e4d-a371-6939704ff2fe\/@D03B8ZGN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,B7-H3,Enoblituzumab,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17097"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yanni Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Xuejun Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyun Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhen Sheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengyi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor B.

Recombinant interleukins (IL) have had limited clinical success due to short pharmacokinetics, inefficient tumor targeting and more frequent dosing, leading to toxicities. To address these issues, we have developed a novel platform that delivers immunomodulators in either a mono- or bispecific format. The platform consists of a fully human, albumin-binding scFv domain (F<sub>H<\/sub>AB) that provides an improved pharmacokinetic profile, enhanced tumor targeting by binding over-expressed FcRn, GP60 and SPARC, a dose-sparing effect that further decreases the toxicity risk, and a broader therapeutic index.<br \/>Interleukin-12, IL-15, and IL-18 are among the most potent inducers of anti-tumor activity and have been evaluated in numerous clinical studies. Sonnet's bispecific drug candidates are constructed with IL-12 on the F<sub>H<\/sub>AB platform, and include IL12-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB-IL15, GMcsf-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB-IL12, and IL18-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB-IL12. These bispecific molecules span a broad range of mechanisms of action that bridge innate and adaptive tumor immunity. They are produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells using an intensified perfusion manufacturing process that allows for rapid scale-up for commercial manufacturing. <b><\/b><br \/>The &#8220;cold&#8221; immunosuppressive B16-F10 melanoma tumor model was used for comparing the efficacy of the bispecific candidates administered in a single i.v. dose. All three constructs showed statistically significant tumor size reduction compared to placebo or native interleukin at a 5&#181;g dose: 67% for IL12-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB-IL15, 37% for GMcsf-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB-IL12 and 76% for IL18-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB-IL12. At lower dose levels with nearly equivalent efficacy, mice showed no body weight loss and exhibited reduced toxicity with transient adverse reactions that resolved by Day 8.<br \/>Optimal synergistic efficacy occurred with the IL18-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB-IL12 bispecific. Interestingly, IL-18 upregulates the IL-12 receptor and vice versa. Further, IL-18 also increased levels of chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, which in turn resulted in significant increases in activated NK, NKT, Th1, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, as well as an increase in M1 and decrease in M2 cells in the tumor vs. the spleen. This data points to the potential for changing immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to clinically responsive &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.<br \/>In conclusion, these studies demonstrated that while the powerful anti-tumor effects of IL-12 are evident in the monospecific IL12-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB, in the bispecific format IL-12 can synergize with other cytokines <i>e.g.,<\/i> IL-18 and GM-CSF, resulting in superior anti-tumor activity when compared to their monospecific modalities. Ongoing <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies<i> <\/i>will involve bispecific IL-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB constructs used with various checkpoint inhibitors to further improve the immune stimulation and anti-tumor activities of novel combination therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d67f3dad-1e2a-47a4-94ff-58d66aa5846f\/@D03B8ZGN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Interleukin-12,Bispecific antibody,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17099"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John K.

While crucial to immunity against intracellular pathogens, viruses, and tumors, cDC type I (cDC1) are a relatively rare population and constitute about 0.05% of cells in the blood. Using these rare cells in screening assays can be a challenge, as very small proportions are found in peripheral human blood and since they are difficult to isolate with high viability and purity. Existing methods to generate acceptable numbers of cDC1s require a feeder cell line, which is not accessible to many laboratories.<br \/>Using a systematic approach, we developed a scalable differentiation system to generate a mixed culture containing cDC1 cells from CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells isolated from cord blood that does not require feeder cells. This culture of cells has been phenotypically and functionally characterized to express high levels of CD141 and Clec9a, as well as responsiveness to various activating stimuli including poly (I:C). Cells derived from this culture method express similar levels of CD141 and Clec9a compared to those observed in peripheral blood of healthy donors. Our effort to find a less laborious, more efficient system includes comparison to cDC1 responses from an in vitro differentiation system to cDC1s isolated from humanized mouse bone marrow, with evaluation of both surface marker phenotype and responsiveness to activating stimuli. We also compared the responses of these cells to monocyte derived dendritic cells that express CD141 and Clec9a. These data demonstrate that the HSC-derived cDC1 cultures provide a comparison of unique dendritic cells that may be utilized for screening assays in an industry setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/96d739d5-6032-4253-8363-492be76e6d19\/@D03B8ZGN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,Conventional Dendritic Cell,in vitro Model Development,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17100"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laura L.

This refractory state originates from PDAC&#8217;s unique immunosuppressive microenvironment that is densely populated by suppressive myeloid cells, exhibits poor vascularity, and is highly hypoxic. We previously showed that the hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 (Evofosfamide) reduces intratumoral hypoxia through a tissue remodeling process, initiates tumor vasculature reorganization, and sensitizes aggressive, spontaneous murine models of prostate cancer to ICB. In a clinical trial testing the combination of Evofosfamide with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA-4) blockade (NCT03098160) a subset of metastatic, immune checkpoint blockade refractory patients showed prolonged progression free survival. While these studies highlight hypoxia reduction as therapeutically tractable, we lack complete understanding of the contribution of the tumor vasculature to hypoxia reduction therapy, as well as the downstream consequences of hypoxia reduction on the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment and the responsiveness to immunotherapy.<br \/>We used a transplantable, orthotopic pancreatic tumor model derived from <i>Kras<sup>+\/LSL-G12D<\/sup>; Trp53<sup>+\/LSL-R172H<\/sup>; Pdx1-Cre<\/i> mice and a syngeneic prostate tumor model to study tumor responses to hypoxia-reduction, anti-angiogenic therapy, and combination immunotherapy.<br \/>We find that Evofosfamide with anti-VEGFR-2 (DC101) significantly extends mouse survival. Combination therapy reduces intratumoral hypoxia, improves vessel integrity, and increases intratumoral DNA damage. In response to the improved metabolic microenvironment, CD8 T cells gain enhanced effector function and lose expression of exhaustion-associated features. Like other anti-angiogenic regimens, combination Evofosfamide and DC101 leads to an increased frequency of PD-L1 expressing cells within the tumor, however blockade of PD-1 failed to prolong survival. Bulk-tumor RNA sequencing and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte analysis implicates immature myeloid cells as mediators of resistance. Re-education of the infiltrating myeloid stroma with CD40 agonist could improve responses to hypoxia-reducing, anti-angiogenic therapy. Put together, these data indicate that targeted hypoxic reduction with anti-angiogenic therapy remodels the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. In this setting, CD40 agonist over PD-1 blockade provides an additive benefit in prolonging mouse survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7d80e1f2-edb3-4e84-8c8b-e9233e237a4b\/@D03B8ZGN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Hypoxia,Antiangiogenic therapy,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17101"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arthur J.

PDAC displays a high degree of tumor heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with lower tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). These factors contribute to resistance against chemotherapies and immunotherapies. Immunotherapies have shown activities across different tumor types including chemotherapy or targeted therapy resistant cancers however these options have little efficacy in the PDAC tumor. Here, in this study we tested the efficacy of gemcitabine in combination with Cadi-05 (TLR2 agonist) against established murine PDAC tumor models (Pan02 in C57\/BL6 and 688M in B6129SF1\/J). Animals were randomized to receive gemcitabine, Cadi-05, their combination or no treatment when they had tumor size &#8776; 50 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, 65mm<sup>3<\/sup> and 100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>. The weekly treatment of gemcitabine, Cadi-05 and their combination inhibited the tumor progression across all tumor sizes. At the end of study, PBMC and tumors were collected and analyzed for different immune parameters. Results revealed that Cadi-05 treatment alone was associated with increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in PBMC as well as amongst TIL with significant decrease in their expression of immunosuppressive markers like FOXP3 and PD-1. Its combination with gemcitabine synergized the effect of each other. There was further increase in absolute TIL as well as TIL expressing CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> markers with decrease in FOXP3 and PD-1 expressing CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TIL. Inhibition of tumor progression was associated with improved effector function of PBMC. Synergy between Cadi-05 and gemcitabine was also evident in effector function. In presence of established tumor, TLR2 agonist Cadi-05 improves effector function, increases CD4+ and CD8+ expressing TIL, decreases immune suppressive TIL and retards tumor growth. Our study suggests that combination of gemcitabine and Cadi-05 inhibits the tumor growth irrespective of its size and it is coupled with increased anti-tumor response and decreased immunosuppressive function","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/42e9be4d-5957-4ee8-9639-7e93d02994a7\/@D03B8ZGN\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Pancreatic cancer,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17102"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arpit Dheeraj<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chandreshwar Shukla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhanir Tailor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nayan K.

Several cyclic di-nucleotide (CDN) and non-CDN small molecule STING agonists have demonstrated effectiveness against cancer in preclinical animal models, however their clinical trials showed limited therapeutic efficacy. ONM-501, a dual-activating STING agonist employs PC7A, a synthetic polymer that induces polyvalent STING condensation and prolongs innate immune activation has been recently developed. ONM-501 encapsulates the endogenous STING agonist cGAMP with the PC7A micelles offering dual &#8216;burst&#8217; and &#8216;sustained&#8217; STING activation. The mechanism and effectiveness of intratumorally delivered ONM-501 as an immunotherapy against solid tumors has been demonstrated in preclinical models.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: ONM-501 was recently evaluated for STING activation across different species: STING related <i>IFNB1<\/i> and <i>CXCL10 <\/i>gene<i> <\/i>expression after ONM-501 treatment was measured by RT-qPCR in PBMCs from rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human. ONM-501 antitumor efficacy was evaluated in murine syngeneic tumor models. Abscopal effect was demonstrated by studying antitumor efficacy using both a primary\/distal model and a lung metastatic model. STING knockout mice and STING knockout cancer cells were used to clarify the dependence of STING status to the ONM-501 antitumor immunity. Immune cell dependence was further elucidated by depletion of specific immune cell populations. Pilot safety studies including major organ function and systemic cytokine levels were performed in immunocompetent mice.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: STING activation was observed across different species by measuring <i>IFNB1<\/i> and <i>CXCL10<\/i> mRNA in PBMCs from rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human after ONM-501 treatment. Antitumor efficacy was demonstrated both as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1 in six different syngeneic tumor models. ONM-501 also induced an abscopal effect - tumor inhibition was observed in both primary and distal MC38 tumors in the same animal. Reduction of lung metastasis in an immune &#8220;cold&#8221; triple negative orthotopic breast cancer 4T1 model further confirmed the systemic antitumor immunity. Knocking out host STING (i.e. STING KO mice) rather than cancer cell STING KO resulted in abrogation of tumor inhibition suggesting that the host STING status is responsible for ONM-501-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Immune cell depletion studies further clarified that the antitumor immunity is dependent on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell and dendritic cells (DCs). No alteration of main organ function or systemic cytokine storm were observed in the pilot safety study.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: ONM-501 demonstrated marked anti-tumor efficacy in a panel of syngeneic tumor models. The anti-tumor effect was mediated by host STING and dependent on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and DCs. These results support further evaluation of ONM-501 as a clinical candidate for the potential treatment of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/44695cc0-b728-48eb-8eb9-072552941458\/@D03B8ZGN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Innate immunity,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17106"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Suxin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Wilhelm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Qingtai Su<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaurav Bharadwaj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Miller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katy Torres<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruolan Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tian Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinming Gao<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, poor drug solubility hampered further development of this approach. Here we introduce PPRX-1701, a 6&#8217;-bromoindirubin acetoxime (BiA) containing drug\/polymer nanoparticle formulation which can be injected intravenously at relatively high concentrations. Here we examine the efficacy and mechanism of PPRX-1701 in murine glioblastoma models.<br \/>Methods: In vitro glioblastoma cell proliferation and migration assays were performed using standard approaches. Effects of PPRX-1701 on interferon-&#947; (IFN &#947;) signaling were determined by Western blotting. Delivery to murine GBM was assessed using a luminescent reporter assay, and survival studies were performed in immunocompetent murine glioblastoma models.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>PPRX-1701 effects on glioblastoma cell proliferation and migration were indistinguishable from BiA alone. Our data show that intravenous administration of PPRX-1701 is well-tolerated and can reach intracranial murine glioblastoma as assessed by luminescent reporter assays. PPRX-1701 administration leads to improved survival in the GL261 glioblastoma mouse model (median survival 30 days (control), 47 days (treated), p &#60; 0.0001). Treatment with PPRX-1701 was associated with alterations in the tumor immune microenvironment, with reduced Tregs and pro-tumor macrophages, and increased CD8+ T cells. Further mechanistic studies have shown that PPRX-1701\/BiA blocks the expression of multiple immunosuppressive molecules in GBM downstream of interferon-&#947; (IFN&#947;) including PD-L1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) - a key enzyme in the tryptophan-kynurenine-aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Trp-Kyn-AhR) immunosuppressive pathway. BiA promoted more effective T-cell mediated tumor cell killing using patient derived glioblastoma <i>ex vivo<\/i> co-culture models.<br \/>Conclusion: This data supports further development of PPRX-1701 as a candidate immunotherapeutic agent for glioblastoma treatment.

We have also shown that Bcat1 gene expression is enriched in exhausted CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> intratumoral cells in cancer patients from diverse cancers. Here, we illustrate that the adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of murine CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells treated with ERG245 increased the median survival of CT26 tumor-bearing mice from 25 days, observed with the ACT of untreated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, to 32 days. This suggested that inhibition of BCAT1 prevented the known exhaustion of adoptively transferred CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, induced by the tumor microenvironment of CT26 tumors. To confirm this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro model of generating terminally exhausted (PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>TIM-3<sup>+<\/sup>GZMB<sup>+<\/sup>CXCL13<sup>+<\/sup>) CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells by subjecting the cells to consecutive cycles of &#945;CD3\/&#945;CD28 activation in the presence of TGF-&#946;. Addition of ERG245 in the last activation cycle decreased terminal exhaustion of the cells. Mechanistically, bulk RNAseq experiments indicated and ICP analysis confirmed that inhibition of BCAT1 interfered with metal homeostasis leading to increased concentrations of Fe in the mitochondria and decreased concentrations of Zn in the nucleus of newly activated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. The immediate impact of ERG245 treatment on the cells included a general decrease in the genes of processes depending on proper metal equilibrium such as cholesterol biosynthesis and ribosome biogenesis. Withdrawal of BCAT1 restored or reversed the cell phenotype leading to epigenetically altered CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells with decreased histone acetyltransferase and histone demethylase presence, increased cytotoxicity, and increased ribosome biogenesis. Collectively, the data suggest that temporal inhibition of BCAT1 inhibition induces profound effects on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells including increased cytotoxicity and suppression of terminal exhaustion, thus rendering the cells rescuable by anti-PD-1 therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/80491d56-f1eb-4fb4-8c76-6f8f40c8f834\/@D03B8ZGN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Iron,Immune checkpoint blockade,Ribosomal RNA transcription,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17112"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adonia E.

Combination approaches with other ICI mAbs may improve outcomes, however, systemic administration of immunostimulatory mAb combinations further increases risk for treatment-induced immune related adverse effects (irAEs). We have previously shown that intratumoral (IT) administration of PH-894, a self-delivering RNAi compound targeting BRD4 built on proprietary INTASYL&#8482; technology, imparts tumor control <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> via effects on both T cells and tumor cells. Local priming of the immune response has shown promise toward potentiating the impact of systemic immunotherapy; therefore, we hypothesized that IT PH-894 might potentiate the efficacy of systemic anti-PD-1 mAb therapy. To assess this <i>in vivo<\/i>, an identical inoculum (5e05) of CT26 cells was implanted subcutaneously into the bilateral flanks of BALB\/c mice. Vehicle (PBS; IT), anti-PD-1 mAb (0.1 mg\/dose; intraperitoneal (IP)), PH-894 (0.5 mg\/dose; IT) or combination anti-PD-1 mAb (0.1 mg\/dose; IP) + PH-894 (0.5 mg\/dose; IT) were administered, with IT doses limited to the tumor on the left flank only, on Days 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13. Tumors on the opposite flank were left untreated. Tumor volumes and body weights were recorded. Tumors, spleens, and lymph nodes were isolated for <i>ex vivo <\/i>mechanistic studies. The abscopal effects of IT PH-894 were confirmed in a bilateral Hepa1-6 model of murine hepatoma. In the CT26 model, as expected, growth of both tumors was inhibited with systemic anti-PD-1. Treatment with IT PH-894 provided a similar level of tumor control compared to treatment with IP anti-PD-1 mAb, both for the PH-894 directly-treated tumors, but in addition also towards the PH-894 untreated distal tumors, an abscopal impact. Additionally, IT PH-894 enhanced the antitumor efficacy of systemic anti-PD-1 mAb therapy, not only for the PH-894 locally treated tumors, but for the PH-894 untreated distal tumors. These data show that IT administered PH-894 potentiated the efficacy of systemic anti-PD-1 mAb, both locally and toward PH-894 untreated distal tumors. In addition, PH-894 silencing of BRD4 not only inhibited tumor growth at the local site of therapy, but also elicited an abscopal effect toward distal tumors, with efficacy similar to that provided by systemically administered anti-PD-1 mAb. These results indicate that IT PH-894 can potentiate the efficacy of systemic anti-PD-1 mAb, warranting further investigation of clinical applications in combination with anti-PD-1 mAbs toward improving patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a3f79035-5868-4711-839c-ea4f095bc577\/@D03B8ZGN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,RNAi,Vaccines,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17114"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin Cuiffo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Maxwell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dingxue Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shenghua Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brianna Rivest<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Boone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Cardia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon P.

This results in depletion of T cell, which can limit the efficacy of classical immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here we introduce a novel pharmacological inhibitor that inhibits nanotube-mediated mitochondria transfer from immune cell to cancer cell. Our preliminary study implicates the exocyst complex in the nanotube assembly. We performed molecular dynamic simulations to identify the potential inhibitors for the exocyst proteins. We have identified a drug candidate, TS-1, which successfully inhibits the mitochondria transfer from immune cell to cancer cell. Currently we are exploring the modification of the structural component to increase the inhibitory potential of the drug. TS-1-loaded liposome significantly inhibited tumor growth in a 4T1 metastatic breast cancer mouse model. We observed considerable increase in intratumoral T cell population with treatment. Furthermore, the use of TS-1 in combination with an anti-PD1 inhibitor resulted in effective tumor reduction in the 4T1 model, which typically responds poorly to anti-PD1 therapy alone.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, the inhibition of nanotube-mediated mitochondrial hijacking from immune cells emerges as an approach for the development of next generation of immunotherapy agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a1fac42-e8eb-4eba-b829-0a0fb21e3c2f\/@E03B8ZGP\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Mitochondria,Drug design,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17116"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tanmoy Saha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruparoshni Jaybalan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>HaeLin Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiladitya Sengupta<\/i><\/presenter>.

It also represents an important mechanism of clinical resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Recently, the transcription factor NR4A1 has been shown to be upregulated in tumor-specific T cells and plays a role in driving exhaustion during chronic antigen stimulation of T cells. Pro-oncogenic activities of NR4A1 have long been observed in various solid tumors including colorectal and breast cancers, and co-expression of NR4A1 with known immune checkpoint markers such as PD-L1 have also been observed in various cancer cell lines. These findings have identified NR4A1 as an important target for overcoming resistance to cancer immunotherapy. We hypothesize that multi-targeting to simultaneously block PD-1 signaling and silence NR4A1 gene expression can reverse T-cell exhaustion and expand the clinical benefit of PD-1 blockade in immune therapy resistant solid tumors. Using our SeekR&#8482; RNA therapeutics platform, we combined aptamer binders to PD-1 with siRNA against NR4A1, andNR4A1 and evaluated their ability to reverse T-cell exhaustion and re-activate T-cell based anticancer immunity in solid tumors. Specifically, we created SeekR&#8482; therapeutic RNA molecules with dual flanking RNA aptamers binders to PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors, connected by a double stranded bridge that encodes for siRNA silencers that target multiple immunomodulatory genes, such as NR4A1. The novel anti-PD-1 RNA aptamer component serve to: A) direct and deliver the SeekR&#8482; RNA oligo therapeutics to exhausted T-cells that express PD-1 receptors; and B) internalize the siRNA component into the T-cells. The siRNA components of the SeekR&#8482; serve to silence NR4A1 which lead to reversal of the cytotoxic T-cell exhausted phenotype following chronic in-vitro stimulation. These results demonstrate that dual targeting of PD-1 and NR4A1 has the potential to reverse T-cell exhaustion and the potential to overcome cancer immunotherapy resistance in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e9f24eb2-f056-4fac-b381-dbe05a254e91\/@E03B8ZGP\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"siRNA,T cell,Immuno-oncology,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17117"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marvin O'ketch<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victoria A.

Moreover, CD3 bispecific antibody-mediated tumor targeting as well as T cell engagement have resulted in cytokine release syndrome (CRS), increased on-target\/off-tumor toxicities and poor T cell in&#64257;ltration, which may affect safety and limit therapeutic ef&#64257;cacy. To better understand the relationship between T cell activation and systemic cytokine release in the context of CD3 bispecific antibody treatment, a homozygous human CD3EDG HuGEMM<sup>TM <\/sup>preclinical model was developed.<br \/>Methods: The homozygous CD3EDG HuGEMM mice, which express human CD3&#949;\/CD3&#948;\/CD3&#947; on the surface of T cells, were subcutaneously inoculated with MC38 or MC38-hEpCAM HuCELL&#8482; syngeneic tumors and treated with vehicle, anti-mPD-1 (RMP1-14), OKT3, and anti-hCD3&#215;hEpCAM. For efficacy studies, mouse body weight and tumor volume were measured twice weekly and tumor growth inhibition (TGI%) was determined. To investigate OKT3 or CD3 bispecifics-induced cytokine release, mouse body weight was monitored daily and several inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines in the serum were detected by MSD.<br \/>Results: Firstly, anti-mPD-1 treatment (5 mg\/kg and 15 mg\/kg <i>i.p.<\/i>) of homozygous CD3EDG mice engrafted with MC38 syngeneic tumors led to 42% and 62% TGI, respectively. OKT3 treatment of MC38-hEpCAM bearing homozygous CD3EDG HuGEMM promoted tumor growth (TGI= -80%), likely due to activation-induced cell death (AICD) of T cells. In addition, CRS was induced within 24 hours of OKT3 dosing, with IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; peaking 2 hr post the 1st dose, and IFN-&#947;, IL-10 and IL-5 peaking 6 hr post the 1st dose. In contrast, no significant cytokine release was observed upon anti-hCD3&#215;hEpCAM treatment despite remarkable TGI, indicating that the delicate balance of <i>in vivo<\/i> T cell activation and T cell cytotoxicity is crucial for effective tumor killing by CD3 bispecific antibodies or engagers.<br \/>Conclusions: Our CD3EDG HuGEMM and HuCELL models provide a predictive platform for <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy and safety assessment of CD3 bispecific or trispecific antibodies. The uncoupling of systemic cytokine release and T cell cytotoxicity via CD3 bispecific or trispecific antibodies provides a biological rationale to clinically explore preventative treatment approaches to avoid or reduce CRS-related toxicity, as well as combination approaches to increase selectivity and efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/18601fd2-3acc-43b0-a39f-119d9d433133\/@E03B8ZGP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,AICD,Cytokine release,CD3 Bispecifics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19393"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel XF He<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
