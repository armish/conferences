Her lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center performed the first gene editing experiment, expressing a rare-cutting endonuclease to generate a DNA double-strand break (DSB) in the mammalian genome and developing genetic and molecular assays to identify DSB repair events. These experiments established a crucial role for both homologous recombination, also called homology-directed repair (HDR), and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) in DSB repair: A DSB repaired by NHEJ leads to a variety of mutations in the genome, while a DSB repaired by HDR leads to a predetermined modification. With the approaches established in the lab, the breast cancer suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2 were determined to be crucial for HDR repair, thus implicating HDR as a tumor suppression mechanism. The lab also has a major effort directed at understanding the generation and repair of programmed DSBs during meiotic progression which are essential for genome transmission. Dr. Jasin is a member of NAS, NAM, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was awarded the Basser Global Prize for BRCA Research in 2018  and the Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine in 2019.","PresenterDisplayName":"Maria Jasin, PhD","PresenterKey":"e1be12fd-91c7-47ef-b2c8-2868bf53b05b","PresenterPhoto":"https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/assocphotos\/101\/e1be12fd-91c7-47ef-b2c8-2868bf53b05b.profile.png","SearchResultActions":null,"SearchResultBody":"Homologous recombination deficient mutation cluster in tumor suppressor RAD51C identified by comprehensive analysis of cancer variants","SearchResultFooter":"","SearchResultHeader":"Apr 11 2022 10:15AM","SessionId":"80","SessionOnDemand":"False","SessionTitle":"The Shape-Shifting Cancer Genome","ShowChatLink":"false","Start":"4\/11\/2022 11:10:00 AM","Status":"Presenting","Tags":null,"ThumbnailUrl":null,"Title":"Homologous recombination deficient mutation cluster in tumor suppressor RAD51C identified by comprehensive analysis of cancer variants","Topics":null,"cSlideId":""},{"Abstract":"There is no abstract associated with this presentation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Other","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":".
