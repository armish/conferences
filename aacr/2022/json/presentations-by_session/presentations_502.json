[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Genotoxicity which is an important indicator of DNA damage, repair and cell rejuvenation has been a predisposing factor to cancer development evidenced by bone marrow suppression in leukemia and studies have proven the effect of several agents inclusive of natural products to induce, prevent and treat genotoxicity through experimental models and clinical trials.<br \/><b>Aim:<\/b>The genotoxic preventive potential of <i>Annona muricata<\/i> ethanol leaves extract on N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (NEU) pro-leukemia carcinogen in mice model using micronuclei formation in bone marrow was assessed.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> 48 mice weighing 18-24g were randomly divided into six groups of eight mice each comprising of the; mice intravenously administered 20mg\/kg of NEU 48 hourly 3 times (A); 80mg\/kg of NEU 48 hourly 3 times (B); negative control fed with feed and water only (C); 0.2ml (0.1g\/ml) ethanolic leaves extract of <i>Annona muricata <\/i> for 3 weeks prior to administration of low dose of NEU (D); 0.2ml (0.1g\/ml) ethanolic extract of <i>Annona muricata <\/i> for 3 weeks prior to administration of high dose of NEU (E); and <i>Annona muricata<\/i> (ethanolic leaves extract) and commercial diet for adverse\/ toxicity group (F). After six weeks of last exposure, animals were ethically sacrificed, bone marrow harvested, smeared, stained using MayGrumwald and number of micronucleus polychromatic erythrocyte (MNPCEs) were determined microscopically.<b>Result<\/b>: Groups exposed to various dosage of the NEU yielded significantly increased MNPCEs with group B producing higher MNPCEs than A. The groups treated with extract displayed a significant reduction in the MNPCEs despite the prior exposure concentrations of NEU. The<br \/>adverse group displayed no difference in MNPCEs when compared with the negative control (Table 1).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The extract displayed profound capacity to prevent genotoxicity thereby alleviating leukemia condition and it is well tolerated.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{45B5C0DD-E341-4A84-93D8-5583F36B3F56}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Week <\/b><b>Number<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\"><b> Groups (Mean&#177;Standard deviation of MNPCE)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>A<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>B<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>C<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>D<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>E<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>F<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14.13&#177;0.56<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">50.45&#177;2.31<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.52&#177;0.34<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.15&#177;0.49<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.11&#177;1.11<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.53&#177;0.45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.01&#177;0.18<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">53.77&#177;1.95<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.61&#177;0.67<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7.85&#177;0.98<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20.34&#177;2.34<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.62&#177;0.23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16.11&#177;0.22<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">56.95&#177;2.01<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.91&#177;0.88<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.01&#177;1.01<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25.11&#177;1.67<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.63&#177;0.45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.64&#177;1.68<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">68.23&#177;1.56<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.82&#177;0.75<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.07&#177;0.67<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30.54&#177;2.34<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.92&#177;0.67<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d6e3cf04-ab91-4097-a214-1f9699c87aa6\/@x03B8ZPn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoprevention,Genotoxicity,Leukemia carcinogen,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15452"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Olufemi Emmanuel Akanni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunice Oluwaseyi Bamisaye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunday Anthony Fashina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fatai Adesina Abdulraheem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Solomon Olufemi Fadiora<\/i><\/presenter>.

The use of technologies, such as next generation sequencing (NGS), have led to the discovery of tumor biomarkers that are currently being used to guide personalized treatments to improve overall survival. Although several studies have characterized breast cancer tumors in Caucasian and European patients, a comprehensive genetic profiling of tumors from Puerto Rican Hispanics (PRH) has not been performed. In order to have a better understanding of the tumor biology of breast cancer among PRH, in this study we aimed to characterize the mutational landscape of breast cancer tumors from PRH and compare them to data available from other racial\/ethnic groups from the mainland U.S..<br \/>Methods: A retrospective study design with data provided by CARIS Life Sciences was used to: 1) Estimate the prevalence of somatic mutations among breast cancer tumors from 189 Hispanics from PR (PRH) that underwent NGS testing from 2015 to 2020; and 2) Compare the mutation prevalence of PRH tumors with the breast cancer mutational profiles available through the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas Clinical Data (TCGA) and the AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE), both databases can be accessed through the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Descriptive statistics were performed to characterize the database.<br \/>Results: Among the top mutated genes for breast cancer tumors among PRH were<i> TP53<\/i> (65.9%, n=126), <i>PIK3CA<\/i>(22.7%, n=141), <i>ARID1A<\/i> (14.7%, n=68), <i>NF1<\/i> (9.4%, n=64), <i>RB1<\/i> (9.3%, n=108), <i>PTEN<\/i> (8.3%, n=133), <i>GATA3<\/i> (7.3%, n=137), <i>CDH1<\/i> (5.8%, n=139), <i>MAP3K1 <\/i>(5.6%, N=125), and<i> BRCA2<\/i> (5.1%, n=136). The most frequent gene amplification for PRH were <i>ZNF703 <\/i>(15.0%, n=107), <i>NSD3<\/i> (13.9%, n=108), <i>ADGRA2 <\/i>(12.2%, N=98),<i> FGFR1<\/i> (11.2%, N=107),<i> CCND1 <\/i>(11.1%, n=108), <i>MCL1 <\/i>(10.2%, N=108),<i> FGF3 <\/i>(9.7%, N=93),<i> NOTCH2 <\/i>(9.4%, N=106),<i> FGF4 <\/i>(9.1%, N=99),<i> FGF19 <\/i>(8.8%, N=102),<i> DDX5 <\/i>(6.5%, N=108),<i> EGFR <\/i>(5.7%, N=106),<i> <\/i>and <i> ERBB2 <\/i>(5.6%, N=108).<br \/>Conclusion: This is the first study to report the mutational profile of breast cancer tumors from PRH and to describe the difference in their mutational frequencies when compared other racial\/ethnic populations using data from TCGA and GENIE databases.

We are currently evaluating in a Phase I trial, the combination of Temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy with methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) modified &#947;&#948; T cells (Drug Resistant Immunotherapy, or DRI) during maintenance TMZ in patients receiving the Stupp protocol. In this report, we examine both DRI graft and circulating lymphocyte phenotype and function during the treatment phase.<br \/>Methods: Patients meeting enrollment criteria undergo tumor resection, placement of a Rickham catheter in the tumor cavity, and an apheresis collection immediately prior to standard chemoradiotherapy (CRT). DRI follows TMZ on Day 1 of maintenance and consists of 150mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV TMZ and concurrent intracranial injection of 1.0 x 10<sup>7<\/sup> DRI &#947;&#948;T cells. Peripheral blood (PB) was collected at apheresis and immediately prior to the start of each 28-day maintenance cycle. Flow cytometric (FACS) analysis of PB and DRI grafts using antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16\/56, CD19, TCR-&#947;&#948;, V&#948;1, V&#948;2, CD197, CD27, CD28, CD57, CD45RA, Th1\/Th2\/Th17 PB serum cytokines, and DRI cytotoxic graft function were obtained. When applicable, FFPE sections of recurrent resected GBM tissues were examined for immune infiltration.<br \/>Results: DRI grafts contained 74-93% activated &#947;&#948; T cells with 0.3-0.5 MGMT copies\/cell. Cytotoxicity against K562 ranged from 30% to 75% at 40:1 (E:T). Peripheral lymphodepletion was evident throughout TMZ treatment in the Stupp protocol. T cell counts fell precipitously after CRT and cycle 1 (1647<u>+<\/u>774 vs 609<u>+<\/u>214 cells\/mL) and remained low throughout maintenance phase (range 214-1450 T cells\/mL). NK counts remained normal and showed uneven recovery through the first three cycles but failed to recover for the remainder of maintenance phase. &#947;&#948; T cells also recovered modestly through the first two cycles but failed to recover after additional cycles. Interestingly, CD45RA+CD27- effector T cells showed only slight increases for each patient throughout TMZ maintenance. Cytokine analysis did not show a clear trend except for consistent T cell expression of perforin and IP-10. One patient with recurrent GBM was successfully resected 110d following DRI. Histopathology revealed widespread necrosis with significant infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and &#947;&#948; T cells in the tumor parenchyma.<br \/>Conclusions: Standard of care TMZ is lymphodepleting and DRI therapy can be conducted in an environment favorable to T cell persistence and sustained immune response. One treated patient demonstrated infiltration of both &#945;&#946; and &#947;&#948; T cells 110 days following a single dose of DRI &#947;&#948; T cells. TMZ maintenance during the Stupp regimen prolongs lymphodepletion, thereby presenting a favorable setting for adoptive cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/016c1c00-651a-468b-ad54-1a4a0c611443\/@x03B8ZPn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Combination therapy,Immunotherapy,T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15455"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lawrence S.

MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase whose primary function is to inhibit p53 activity by impeding p53 transcriptional activity, promoting nuclear export, and inducing p53 degradation. The use of investigational MDM2 inhibitors such as milademetan (RAIN-32) may provide a therapeutic strategy for select tumors with wildtype (WT) TP53. Gene amplification (amp) represents a mechanism for cancer cells to upregulate expression of critical cancer related genes and can serve as a predictive biomarker for targeted therapies. Previous work established a gene copy number (CN) threshold of &#8805; 12 for the MANTRA-2 basket study of milademetan in advanced solid tumors (Tirunagaru et al., AACR-NCI-EORTC 2021). We used publicly available AACR-GENIE data and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to explore MDM2 amp in relation to TP53 status and other genetic biomarkers across solid tumors.<br \/>MDM2 amp occurs in most cancer types, with the most frequent rates of MDM2 amp occurring in sarcomas, bladder, hepatobiliary, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric\/esophageal, breast, and melanoma cancers. MDM2 was mutually exclusive of TP53 mutations at CN &#8805; 12 with OR = 0.21 (p = 5.3 x 10<sup>-8<\/sup>). Tumors with WT TP53 and MDM2 CN &#8805; 12 comprised 1.19% of all solid tumors in the TCGA (n=9,090) and 1.22% in the AACR-Genie dataset (n=42,125). The MDM2 and CDK4 genes are located on chromosome 12q13-15 and these genes are frequently co-amplified in LPS and other sarcomas; however, MDM2 and CDK4 co-amp is variable in other tumors with less frequent co-amp occurring in NSCLC and melanoma and rare co-amp occurring in bladder, breast cancer and gastro-esophageal tumors, particularly at MDM2 CN &#8805; 12. We also evaluated co-mutations in known oncogenes (filtered for oncogenic variants using cancerhotspots.org) in tumors with MDM2 CN &#8805; 4. Co-alteration of MDM2 amp in this group of tumors was &#60;15% for all MDM2 amp tumors and did not vary significantly with increasing MDM2 CN. OS survival analysis revealed that prognosis for patients with all levels of MDM2 amp was worse compared to non-amp tumors and OS at MDM2 CN &#8805; 12 [41.7 months(m)] was similar to tumors harboring TP53 mutations (55.0m) as compared to patients with tumors harboring WT TP53 and MDM2 CN &#60;12 (118.8m).<br \/>In conclusion, MDM2 amp was mutually exclusive of TP53 mutations at CN &#8805; 12 and occurred in 1.2% of all cancers and occurred across multiple tumor types, supportive of a tumor agnostic therapeutic strategy for milademetan. CDK4 was not co-amplified with MDM2 in many tumor types and oncogenic alterations occurred infrequently with MDM2 amp. MDM2 amp was associated with a poor prognosis consistent with an unmet need in these cancer patients.

Mechanisms underlying response to treatment are not well understood. We previously performed bulk multi-omics analysis aimed at identifying biological differences between poor (PR) and excellent responders (ER) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Although differences were found, these were not as extensive as we had anticipated, suggesting that important molecular differences between such tumors may not be fully evident by bulk analyses. Thus, we carried out in-depth spatial analysis of HGSC to explore heterogeneity of disease and determine how the dynamic behavior between the tumor and the tumor microenvironment varies between PR and ER groups.<br \/><b><i>Methods:<\/i><\/b> We selected a cohort of patients with highly annotated HGSC samples categorized by response to NACT (PR and ER) and analyzed pre-treatment tumor tissues using bulk RNA sequencing (bRNASeq) and Visium Spatial Gene Expression. The definition of PR was stable or progressive disease after 3-4 cycles and\/or suboptimal interval cytoreduction after NACT. ER was complete response or only microscopic disease left at the time of interval surgery.<br \/><b><i>Results:<\/i><\/b><i> <\/i>To generate expression profiles, we used an unsupervised approach and identified nine distinct clusters, with at least 20 cell types. A comparison of the cell populations identified more stroma-dominated cell groups in the PR group. ER tumors contained more immune-related areas, with a high proportion of T, B and natural killer cells. This finding supports the established role of cytotoxic immune cells in strengthening chemotherapy response and better overall survival. In comparison with bRNASeq, we observed a <i>blending<\/i> phenomenon that hides deeper heterogeneity of the tumor. Some pathways, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), were statistically enriched in specific clusters of PR compared with the ER group, proving that deep characterization of tumor heterogeneity can be achieved only when exploring specific clusters of cells. The spatial distribution of the clusters showed that in the PR group, the clusters tended to be physically larger and distributed throughout the whole tissue. The ligand-receptor analysis revealed that co-expression of specific ligand-receptor pairing exists depending on their geographical localization, with closer interactions leading to stronger co-expression patterns.<br \/><b><i>Conclusion:<\/i><\/b> Two important findings emerged: importance of the stromal component as a potential driver of poor response to NACT; and identification of differential clusters (distribution and composition) in ER compared with PR tissues. Comparison of the in situ technique with bRNASeq allowed characterization of specific cell subpopulations that might be important determinants of lack of response to therapy, representing candidate therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4663bb66-a449-4694-bf95-fbb720f6f6d6\/@y03B8ZPo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Chemotherapy response,Tumor heterogeneity,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15458"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elaine Stur<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Corvigno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingchu Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ken Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanghoon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinsong Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilly Ricco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Fleming<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emine Bayraktar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Kraushaar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianhua Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anil K.

Whilst population level genomic analyses can estimate the proportion of driver events within a given gene, they cannot categorize individual variants. Reliable annotation remains a significant barrier to unlocking the full utility of cancer genomics. GENIE (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange) data was used to generate codon recurrence scores (CRS) for known cancer genes. GENIE was parsed to remove duplicates, sequencing artefact (recurrent variants reported by one institution, invariably associated with amplicon-based sequencing) and hypermutated samples (&#62;15 mutations per megabase). For missense mutations, a codon recurrence of &#8805;10 was used to classify driver mutations.<br \/>The table shows proportion of missense mutations classified as drivers by gene and cancer type, comparing population-based non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratio; dN\/dS (Martincorena 2017, PMID 29056346) <i><\/i>with assessment of individual variants by CRS. This comparison demonstrates a high degree of concordance. For a few genes, CRS under called driver mutations (ie <i>VHL<\/i> in renal cancer) likely due to reduced power with small sample numbers. Importantly, CRS is able to assign driver status to individual missense mutations. Comparison with informatic analyses (PMIDs 28115009, 29247016, 30365005, 31034466) showed equivalent or superior performance of the GENIE approach. These findings demonstrate how a large (and expanding) real-world dataset can be used to predict the driver status of somatic missense mutations at the n=1 variant level. This process is amenable to implementation as a rules-based classification process for somatic missense mutations as part of an automated annotation pipeline.<br \/><table border=\"1\"

This process is labor-intensive and (among other challenges) involves accurately translating between variation representation conventions from one resource to the next. For example, differences in representations of Copy Number Variation (CNV) from genomic regions, cytogenomic bands, or gene features create challenges in knowledge matching due to lack of standards covering all of these modalities of observed variation.The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH; ga4gh.org) is an international collaborative of genomic data sharing initiatives (Driver Projects) developing genomic data sharing standards within a human rights framework. GA4GH recently published the Variation Representation Specification (VRS; pronounced &#8220;verse&#8221;), a standard for the computational representation of biomolecular variation. VRS is a terminology, schema, and associated conventions for creating uniquely identifiable and federatable representations of molecular variation. VRS has formal data classes well-suited to differentiating between variation on a single molecule (e.g. tandem duplications) from variation measured at a systemic level (e.g. genome-wide copy number variation). In addition to molecular sequence variation, VRS also supports variation on cytogenetic coordinate systems and genes, making it well-suited to representing variation associated with cancer biomarkers.We demonstrate the use of VRS to model reported gene-associated CNVs from the AACR Project GENIE cohort, to aid in the computational discovery of evidence from clinico-genomic knowledgebases with genomic or cytogenomic CNV representations. We highlight the use case of knowledge matching to the Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology (&#8220;the Atlas&#8221;; atlasgeneticsoncology.org), a cytogenetics resource historically driven by user website navigation. Using VRS search tools we developed for the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC; cancervariants.org) GA4GH Driver Project, we found that 64% of GENIE samples with reported CNVs matched clinically relevant knowledge in the Atlas. This work was enabled by programmatic search tools leveraging standard VRS object structures, demonstrating how VRS enables collection of real-world evidence across more resources without manual interpretation or custom normalization methods.

VS-6766 produced clinical responses as a single agent in gynecological cancers and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Guo Lancet Oncology 2020). Clinical responses were also observed with VS-6766 in combination with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor defactinib in patients with low-grade serous ovarian cancer and KRAS mutant NSCLC. In patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma, mutations in the RAS\/RAF\/MEK\/ERK (MAPK) pathway occur mainly in BRAF (41%), NRAS (27%), NF1 (25%) and CRAF (2.6%) (AACR Genie v10). Although several selective BRAFV600<\/sup> inhibitors (BRAFi) are FDA-approved alone or in combination with MEK-only inhibitors (MEKi) for melanomas with BRAFV600E\/K<\/sup>, there is still a need for agents to improve response rate, duration of response, and tolerability. There are no targeted therapy options for melanoma patients carrying NRAS or NF1 mutations following progression on immune checkpoint inhibitors. Using low passage cell lines derived from patients with metastatic melanoma and extensively profiled for genomic alterations together with commercially available immortalized human melanoma cell lines, all of which carried mutations in the MAPK pathway, we tested the activity of VS-6766 alone or in combination with other agents. <i>In vitro<\/i> proliferation assays showed that VS-6766 is as potent as BRAFi in BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> melanoma cell lines and is more potent than pan-RAF inhibitors in melanoma cell lines bearing NRAS, NF1 or CRAF mutations. We next tested rational combinations of VS-6766 with other agents in specific genetic backgrounds. In BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> melanoma cell lines, combination of VS-6766 with BRAFi (encorafenib, vemurafenib, dabrafenib) showed greater synergy than combination of MEKi (binimetinib, cobimetinib, trametinib) with BRAFi. Since ~65% of BRAF or NRAS mutant melanomas co-express mutations in the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway, we tested the combination of VS-6766 with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. VS-6766 was synergistic with everolimus in reducing the viability of melanoma cells harboring BRAF or NRAS mutations. Because CDK4\/6 pathway activation has been correlated with poor progression-free survival in melanoma patients treated with BRAFi combined with MEKi, we tested the combination of VS-6766 with the CDK4\/6 inhibitor abemaciclib. We found that VS-6766 was synergistic with abemaciclib in reducing viability of melanoma cell lines. Additional combinations with VS-6766 are currently being tested and will be reported. These preclinical data support clinical testing of VS-6766 in rational combinations for treatment of cutaneous melanoma with BRAF, NRAS, NF1 or CRAF mutations. In clinical trials, a recommended phase 2 dose has been defined for the combination of VS-6766 with everolimus.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f8c68fc4-ea45-40e9-a711-8dc504304262\/@y03B8ZPo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,melanoma,RAF\/MEK inhibitor,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15462"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Antonella Bacchiocchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Silvia Coma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjib Chowdhury<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mario Sznol<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruth Halaban<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan A.

Broad kinase selectivity profiling identified ERK1\/2 and NLK as targets of CC-91516. Crystal structure of CC-91516 in complex with ERK2 reveals that its 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenyl moiety binds to a unique back pocket of the adenosine-5&#8242;-triphosphate (ATP) binding site of ERK2, which is not accessible to other ERK inhibitors such as BVD-523 and GDC-0994. This unique binding mode of CC-91516 leads to a slow off-rate for its ERK binding with long residence time disrupting both the active and inactive ERK forms. Consequentially, CC-91516 causes sustained inhibition of the MAPK pathway in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer cells. In addition, CC-91516 also regulates Wnt\/&#946;-catenin and YAP pathways in multiple cancer cell lines. CC-91516 shows potent yet selective anti-proliferative activity against a large panel of cancer cell lines. Activating mutations in BRAF or CTNNB1 gene associate with sensitivity to CC-91516-mediated anti-proliferative activity while mutations in RB and PI3K\/PTEN pathway associate with resistance. CC-91516 inhibits ex vivo colony formation of PDX models with BRAF and CTNNB1 mutations. In addition, CC-91516 potently induces apoptosis, inhibits survival, and overcomes resistance to MEK inhibitor trametinib of BRAF or CTNNB1 mutant cancer cells in long-term culture assay in vitro. CC-91516 has good oral bioavailability and shows excellent anti-tumor activity in vivo against both BRAF and CTNNB1 mutant xenograft models. DMPK and toxicology studies showed robust oral exposure across preclinical species. In summary, CC-91516 has demonstrated preclinical anti-tumor activities and DMPK and safety profiles in support of its clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f3b0446-cf67-45db-9129-e9a2393b33b2\/@y03B8ZPo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,&#946;-catenin,ERK \/ NLK inhibitor,CC-91516 (CC0776314),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15463"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shuichan Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tam Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Mikolon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Leisten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Chamberlain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurie LeBrun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sogole Bahmanyar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ning Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingjing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mehnaz Malek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ellen Filvaroff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather Raymon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Hubbard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Boylan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Currently, there are no approved targeted therapies for patients with <i>NRG1<\/i> fusion-positive cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated that NRG1 fusions signal through <i>ErbB<\/i>\/HER<i> <\/i>family members and that HER2 inhibition has anti-tumor activity in <i>NRG1<\/i> fusion driven cancers. However, NRG1 binds HER4 in addition to HER3, and the role of individual HER proteins and <i>NRG1<\/i> fusion partners have not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that HER2 and HER4 signaling may have important roles in <i>NRG1<\/i> fusion driven cancers, and pan-HER targeting therapies may be more effective for <i>NRG1<\/i> fusion positive cancers than HER2-specific inhibitors alone. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the frequency of the NRG1 fusions across cBioPortal and AACR project GENIE datasets and MD Anderson&#8217;s GEMINI databases and found that the incidence of <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions in all tumor types was 0.1%. <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions were observed in 3.3% of patients with cervical cancers and in 1.8% of breast cancers and 1.3% of non-small cell lung cancers. The most common fusion partner was <i>CD74<\/i> (9%) and the second most common fusion partner was <i>SLC3A2<\/i> (4%). To determine the role of <i>ErbB<\/i> signaling in NRG1-fusion positive cancers, we engineered Ba\/F3 cells to express various ErbB\/HER family members and the most common NRG1 fusion partners. Then, we evaluated different strategies of targeting NRG1-fusion positive cell lines using drugs that predominantly target EGFR, HER2, EGFR\/HER2, dimerization, or drugs that are pan-HER inhibitors. In Ba\/F3 cells, poziotinib, a pan-HER TKI, showed potent activity against cells harboring <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.19 - 0.36 nM and relative IC<sub>50<\/sub> values (IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of NRG1 fusion\/IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of WT EGFR) of 0.04 &#8211; 0.07. TKIs targeting predominately EGFR\/HER2 (afatinib, dacomitinib and neratinib) we observed modest activity with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 6.8 &#8211; 42 nM and relative IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.11 &#8211; 0.68. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of HER2-specific TKIs (58 &#8211; 122 nM) were higher than EGFR\/HER2 targeting TKIs, but the relative IC<sub>50<\/sub> values (0.005 &#8211; 0.015) were lower than poziotinib. Among antibodies, targeting HER2 dimerization with pertuzumab had better single agent activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 95 &#8211; 156 &#956;g\/ml) than trastuzumab which had no in vitro activity. Lastly, an additive effect was seen when trastuzumab was used in combination with pertuzumab, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.79 &#8211; 1.0 &#956;g\/ml, and poziotinib with trastuzumab and pertuzumab further potentiated activity. Taken together, these data suggest that pan-HER inhibition with agents such as poziotinib alone and in combination with inhibition of dimerization appears more effective than selective EGFR\/HER2 inhibition and highlights the potential of combining agents with multiple mechanisms of HER family targeting. This pan-HER strategy merits further investigation in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0ff4263-9573-460f-8d2c-72d6f15e7e60\/@y03B8ZPo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuregulin,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Antibody,Fusion genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15465"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hibiki Udagawa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqulyne P.

Intra-tumoral microbial activity and events of cellular turnover and trafficking contribute to shedding of microbial nucleic acids into the blood stream. Here we characterized microbial signatures (mbDNA) present in primary-tumor tissue and in the blood of patients affected with different cancer types, with particular focus on lung cancer, and we demonstrated the discriminatory power of such microbial signatures for the identification and classification of lung cancer versus other cancer types. We further validated our findings using plasma-derived cell-free microbial DNA (cf-mbDNA) to discriminate between lung cancer and cancer-free control samples.<br \/>Methods: We examined The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) compendium of treatment-na&#239;ve, whole genome and transcriptomic sequencing datasets to extrapolate genetic signatures of microbial origin associated with 33 different tumor types collected from 10,481 patients, which included non-neoplastic tumor-adjacent tissue and blood samples. 7.2% of TCGA sequencing reads were classified as non-human, of which 35.2% could be taxonomically classified using a reference database containing 59,974 total microbial genomes. These taxonomically assigned data sets were then used to train machine learning models (using a 70\/30 train\/test split for all cancers) to discriminate between and within types and stages of cancer.<br \/>Results: We demonstrated that mbDNA signatures from whole blood can be used to accurately classify the tissue of origin of 20 unique cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. For lung adenocarcinoma we reported high discrimination between paired tumor tissue and normal-adjacent tissue (Avg. {AUROC,AUPR}={0.85,0.95}) and between primary tumor tissue and all-other cancer types (Avg. {AUROC,AUPR}={0.96,0.69}, n=32 cancer-types). We also demonstrated the high performance of blood-derived mbDNA when discriminating among TCGA cancer types: Avg. {AUROC,AUPR}={0.97,0.80}. Subsequent liquid biopsy results using plasma-derived cf-mbDNA offer compelling evidence that cf-mbDNA signatures can robustly discriminate adenocarcinoma lung-cancer samples from non-cancer controls.<br \/>Conclusion: mbDNA holds considerable promise as a truly orthogonal means of detecting and classifying lung cancer independently from host genomic alternations. Using only mbDNA signatures we have demonstrated robust discrimination between cancer-free controls and lung cancer samples and have provided early evidence of the applicability of this approach to liquid biopsy. Our present efforts analyzing plasma cf-mbDNA with an expanded sample cohort will serve to fully validate this new class of liquid biopsy biomarkers for lung cancer detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b901d741-e997-45f9-84bc-974ba7fdb148\/@y03B8ZPo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-11 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15467"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gregory D.
