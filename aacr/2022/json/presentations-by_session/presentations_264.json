Little is known about the concordance between tissue- and blood-derived genomic assessments and the factors that contribute to their discordance, underlying the need for further investigation of sequence alteration profiles for successful adoption of noninvasive tumor profiling. We explored the genomic landscape, including concordance between tTMB and bTMB, in samples from patients who were screened for enrollment into CheckMate 848, a prospective, phase 2 study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab monotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with high TMB (NCT03668119).<br \/>Of 1954 screened patients, 212 were randomized, with a cap of 15% per tumor type. Tissue- (FoundationOne<sup>&#174;<\/sup> CDx&#8212;based Clinical Trial Assay) and blood-based (Foundation Medicine bTMB Clinical Trial Assay) genomic data were utilized for analysis of genomic variants, tTMB, and bTMB. In total, 1438 unique tissue and 1720 unique plasma samples were analyzed during trial screening (June 2021 database lock). Of over 100 screened disease ontologies (taken from the tissue diagnosis), pancreatic (9.7%), breast (8.8%), and ovarian (6.1%) cancers, as well as cholangiocarcinoma (5.2%), were the most common. A total of 1141 tissue and 1573 plasma samples passed established quality control criteria, resulting in ascertainment levels of 79.3% for tTMB and 91.5% for bTMB. A correlation between tTMB and bTMB scores was identified across 1017 tissue and plasma sample pairs (Spearman&#8217;s r, 0.48; P &#60; 0.0001). Median (range) tTMB and bTMB were 3.8 (0&#8212;452.6) and 3.5 (0&#8212;1027.5) mutations per megabase (mut\/Mb), respectively. High microsatellite instability (MSI) was detected in 25 (2.5%) MSI-evaluable tissue samples; in these patients, median tTMB was 25.2 mut\/Mb. At the prespecified cutoff of 10 mut\/Mb, 15.8% and 20.7% of samples had high tTMB and bTMB, respectively; the positive (PPA), negative, and overall percentage agreements between assays were 60%, 88%, and 84%, respectively. TMB correlation (Spearman&#8217;s r, 0.54; P &#60; 0.0001) and PPA (66%) were improved among 806 (79.3%) sample pairs with plasma maximum somatic allele frequency &#8805; 1%.<br \/>In CheckMate 848, data from paired biopsies revealed the complementary nature of TMB assessments from tissue and blood, suggesting that both approaches may have the potential to identify high mutational burden in samples obtained from patients with advanced solid tumors. Further interrogation of the biological and analytical factors affecting tumor- and blood-derived genomic profiling is warranted to support their implementation in clinical settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor mutational burden,Predictive biomarkers,Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jie He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natallia Kalinava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Parul Doshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dean C.

We explored the association between tumor gene expression signatures and clinical outcomes.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In patients with tumor RNA-sequencing data, we analyzed the association of the 18-gene T-cell-inflamed gene expression profile (Tcell<sub>inf<\/sub>GEP) and 10 other signatures (angiogenesis, glycolysis, gMDSC, hypoxia, mMDSC, MYC, proliferation, RAS, stroma\/EMT\/TGF&#946;, WNT) on a continuous scale with outcomes using logistic (ORR) and Cox proportional hazards (PFS; OS) regression. For Tcell<sub>inf<\/sub>GEP, 1-sided (pembro) and 2-sided (pac) <i>P<\/i> values were calculated (prespecified significance, &#945; = 0.05). For the 10 non-Tcell<sub>inf<\/sub>GEP signatures, 1-sided (pembro) and 2-sided (pac) multiplicity-adjusted <i>P<\/i> values were calculated (prespecified significance, &#945; = 0.10). Clinical data cutoff was October 26, 2017.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>There were 274 patients with tumor RNA-sequencing data (n = 137 in each arm). Association with clinical outcomes for gene expression signatures are reported in the Table.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>In this exploratory analysis of patients with previously treated GC from KEYNOTE-061, tumor Tcell<sub>inf<\/sub>GEP showed some association with clinical outcomes for pembro (ORR and PFS) but not pac (ORR, PFS, and OS). The Tcell<sub>inf<\/sub>GEP-adjusted mMDSC signature was negatively associated with clinical outcomes for pembro (ORR, PFS, and OS), while the Tcell<sub>inf<\/sub>GEP-adjusted glycolysis, MYC, and proliferation signatures were negatively associated with OS for pac. This exploratory biomarker analysis suggests that myeloid-driven suppression may play a role in resistance to PD-1 inhibition and supports a strategy of considering immunotherapy combinations intended to target this myeloid axis.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{12E4878D-9A20-439B-9A1A-E0A13A8CB903}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\"

We evaluated the performance of a blood-based cancer screening assay in select tumor types where we believe cancer screening can save lives. The assay interrogates cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation signatures for early-stage cancer (stage I\/II) detection and tissue of origin identification.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Whole blood samples from individuals with (N &#62; 1,500) and without (N &#62; 1,800) cancer were obtained from multiple cohorts. Plasma-derived cfDNA was profiled using a custom assay that enriches fragments with dense CpG methylation and further depletes uninformative background molecules. A broad genomic panel (16 Mb) targeting regions with low rates of methylation in healthy individuals was used to capture and sequence tumor-associated molecules while maintaining high sensitivity at low sequencing cost per sample. A cross-validated analysis was used to estimate out of sample performance of the predictive model. Classification thresholds corresponding to 90% and 95% specificities were established using a set of samples from individuals without a cancer diagnosis.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>To evaluate the performance of this screening assay in cancers with guideline-directed screening protocols, colorectal and lung cancers, detection was assessed at 90% specificity. At this threshold, sensitivity for stage I\/II colorectal and lung cancer was 90% and 87%, respectively. For other cancers with no current guideline-directed screening paradigms, pancreatic and bladder cancers, a specificity threshold of 95% was applied. Sensitivity was 73% and 52% for stage I\/II pancreatic and bladder cancer, respectively. Tissue of origin prediction evaluated at 98% specificity had accurate identification in 99% of colorectal, 94% of lung, 88% of bladder, and 86% of pancreatic cancers.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This multi-cancer targeted screening assay provides robust and sensitive detection of early-stage cancer at thresholds optimized for current screening paradigms with accurate tissue of origin identification.

Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) comprises 1\/3 of all HNSCC and is predominantly HPV(-). Depending upon clinical stage, OCSCC treatment involves surgical resection +\/- neck dissection, followed by radiation +\/- chemotherapy. Our group and others previously described four mRNA expression patterns (classical, atypical, basal, and mesenchymal), each with unique genomic features and prognosis. Here, we further examine the clinical utility of gene expression subtyping in HNSCC and introduce the potential for predictive applications in HPV(-) HNSCC according to clinically relevant subgroups including oral cavity cancer.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures:<\/b> Multiple independent HNSCC datasets were obtained from public repositories, totaling 562 patients, including from MD Andersen (MDA) (GSE41117) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) sourced from the Genome Data Commons. Cases were included for further analysis if they had N stage and overall survival values. Samples were assigned molecular subtypes (basal, mesenchymal, atypical or classical) using a reduced gene set version of the classifier reported earlier. HPV status was determined by HPV gene expression. The clinical endpoint was overall survival at censured at 36 months. Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots and logrank tests were used to investigate associations between clinical variables and survival. Cox models were used to adjust for potential confounders. All statistics were performed using the survival package in R.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of the 418 training patients from the TCGA dataset that met analysis criteria, nearly 20% presented with stage I and II tumors. In the clinically relevant subgroup of node(-) OCSCC patients, mesenchymal subtype was associated with worse survival (HR 2.4, p=0.021), offering a novel and potentially actionable biomarker in otherwise early-stage and low risk disease. Associations in the MDA validation cohort confirmed the association. Node(-) non-mesenchymal OCSCC patients had far better survival (no deaths observed) compared to node(-) mesenchymal and all node(+) patients which had similarly poor survival. Differential responses as a function of radiation will be presented.<br \/><b>Summary and Conclusions: <\/b>This study confirms that the mesenchymal subtype is associated with worse outcomes across all cases of HNSCC. However, we demonstrate that mesenchymal subtype is associated with poor survival, even in the clinically relevant setting of early-stage, node(-) OCSCC treated with surgical resection. These findings highlight the potential value of gene expression subtyping as an adjunct to pathology for deciding which treatment option is best suited for patients with HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Genomics,Predictive biomarkers,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>D.

Liquid biopsy may also provide representative clonal sampling through the disease course, but current clonal deconvolution methods are ineffective in plasma samples with &#60;1% tumor content, common in the localised or MRD setting.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We analysed 1071 plasma samples from 198 TNM I-III NSCLC patients in TRACERx who underwent multiregion exome sequencing of primary tumor and relapse tissue, with 416 standard of care surveillance scans. Seventy-four patients suffered a relapse. We targeted a median of 200 tumor-specific mutations per patient consisting of clonal and subclonal variants and sequenced cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using anchored multiplex PCR to a median unique depth of 2230X with 5 supporting duplicates. We used library-specific trinucleotide background models to call MRD. We developed ECLIPSE (Extraction of CLonality from LIquid bioPSiEs), to perform formal clonal deconvolution in &#60;1% purity plasma samples by leveraging copy number and mutation clone identities from tumor tissue.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Median MRD lead time was 119 days (range 0-1137) in patients with pre-operative circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection. In the 13% of relapse patients lacking pre-operative ctDNA detection the median MRD lead time was 0 days (range 0-589). MRD lead times positively correlated with clonal ctDNA fraction doubling times (DTs). Cancer cell fractions (CCFs) of subclones estimated in plasma with ECLIPSE and tissue collected concurrently were proportional (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001, R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.6). Subclonal mutations that would appear clonal in single biopsies could be separated from true clonal mutations using their CCF in plasma (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001, OR = 0.44), distinguishing clonal from subclonal mutations, where the latter are unlikely to represent effective therapeutic targets. Where cfDNA and tissue was available at relapse we detected 28\/29 metastatic tissue subclones in cfDNA with an additional 8 cfDNA-unique subclones. These subclones were more frequently estimated as present in only a subset of metastatic cells using cfDNA (<i>P<\/i> = 0.008, OR = 5.5) consistent with localisation to unsampled metastatic sites. Metastatic competent subclones had higher CCFs in pre-operative plasma (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001, OR = 4.5). Shifts in clonal dynamics were concurrent with treatment. Finally, patients with cfDNA-detected polyphyletic metastatic seeding had shorter disease-free survival than those with monophyletic seeding (HR = 2.89, 95% CIs 1.46-5.73).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Tumor-informed anchored multiplex PCR most commonly detected MRD before clinical relapse and allowed determination of clonal ctDNA DT. Using ECLIPSE, plasma samples of &#60;1% purity allow formal measurements of clonal dynamics from diagnosis to relapse, which impacts patient outcome and has the potential to guide personalised medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Clonal evolution,Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander Mark Frankell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Abbosh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Garnett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judit Kisistok<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Harrison<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morgan Weichert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abel Licon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Selvaraju Veeriah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bob Daber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mike Moreau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aamir Shahpurwalla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Odell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrian Chesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Litchfield<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilia Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel E.

Here, we report exploratory biomarker analyses from the trial with a potential to identify patients who may benefit from NIVO. Archival or fresh tumor samples were collected before treatment and subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES) (400\/730: 55%) for genetic alterations including high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and WNT\/beta-catenin pathway components, as well as whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (469\/730: 64%) for analysis of individual genes, inflammation signatures and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Associations between biomarkers and best overall response (BOR), progression free survival (PFS) and OS were evaluated at a minimum follow-up of 33&#183;6 months. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that high Gajewski inflammation gene signature score of &#8805;0.47 (30% of tumors) was associated with an improvement in BOR (p=0.0043), PFS (p=0.00065) and OS (p=0.0073) within the NIVO arm only. Upon comparison of NIVO versus SORA, only patients whose tumors were inflammation high demonstrated NIVO benefit for BOR (p=0.017), PFS (p=0.0063) and OS (p=0.037). Responses to NIVO were associated with higher expression of CD8A, CD8B, PDCD1 (PD-1) and other inflammation-associated genes within the tumor (false discovery rate, FDR&#60;0.01). GSEA of 50 hallmark gene sets for ORR showed that responders to NIVO and SORA were enriched in similar gene sets such as inflammatory response, interferon alpha\/gamma response, E2F targets and G2M checkpoint (FDR&#60;0.01). In contrast, GSEA for OS showed inflammatory response and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling gene sets were associated with benefit from NIVO, but shorter OS for SORA (FDR&#60;0.01). WES analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of MSI-H was low (12\/400: 3%) and insufficient to confirm relationship to clinical outcomes (no radiographic responses observed in 9 NIVO- and 3 SORA-treated patients). Alterations within beta-catenin gene were not associated with survival outcomes for NIVO. Overall,<b> <\/b>patients with advanced HCC whose tumors had high Gajewski inflammation gene signature demonstrated improved outcomes with NIVO versus SORA. NIVO responders had higher expression of individual inflammation-associated genes. Expression of inflammatory response and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling gene sets showed association with longer OS for NIVO, but not SORA. These exploratory analyses support further studies of tumor inflammation-related biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit from PD-1 inhibition in advanced HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nivolumab,Biomarkers,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jaclyn Neely<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masatoshi Kudo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard S.
