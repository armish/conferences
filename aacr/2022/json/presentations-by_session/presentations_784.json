[{"Abstract":"Background: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution tissue-imaging modality that enables real-time imaging up to 2mm deep. The Perimeter B-Series OCT System combines wide field-OCT (WF-OCT) with an artificial intelligence system, ImgAssist, to assist clinicians in the detection of lesions suspicious for breast cancer. The objective of this investigational device trial is to assess adjunctive Perimeter B-Series OCT System use compared to standard care in identifying and addressing positive margins intraoperatively.<br \/>Design: Prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-arm trial in females with biopsy-confirmed cancer undergoing breast conservation surgery (BCS) (NCT05113927). Following lumpectomy and standard-of-care intraoperative margin assessment participants will be randomized to a device or control arm (2:1 schema). Controls may undergo intraoperative pathology or frozen section analysis, per routine. WF-OCT will be done on all device arm specimens, with an opportunity to excise tissue from the lumpectomy cavity post-analysis. The new margin will be imaged with WF-OCT and the surgeon may take up to a maximum of 6 total shaves, including up to 2 shaves in each orientation.<br \/>Eligibility: Adult females undergoing breast conservation surgery for biopsy-confirmed Stage 0-III invasive ductal and\/or DCIS are eligible, including post-neoadjuvant therapy. Pregnant or lactating, those with Stage IV cancer, lobular carcinoma as primary diagnosis, previous ipsilateral breast surgery, multi-centric or bilateral disease, use of cryolocalization, or any treatment affecting margin integrity will be excluded.<br \/>Specific Aim: The study hypothesis is that use of the Perimeter B-Series OCT System in BCS will reduce the proportion of subjects with at least 1 unaddressed positive margin. The primary endpoint is occurrence of aat least 1 unaddressed positive margin for a subject. The secondary endpoint is the number of unaddressed positive margins per subject. Safety includes Adverse Events; false-positive shaves per subject (device arm); and BREAST-Q Satisfaction with Breasts subscale. Other outcomes are total excised tissue volume, initial and all procedures including repeat surgeries; margin-level effectiveness (sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV); and operative time.<br \/>Statistical Methods: The study was powered via the primary endpoint, assuming a 15% unaddressed margin rate, 90% power, 2:1 device-to-control ratio, and 10% loss of subjects due to screen or device failure. Both the primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints are based on within-subject comparison of the 2 treatments in the device arm (SOC+WF-OCT).<br \/>Planned Accrual: 309 subjects (206 device, 103 control) will be enrolled at 8 centers over approximately 12 months.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/985cbdab-304d-4529-ae59-0c3f6b95062a\/@w03B8ZYY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-03 Phase III clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Breast,Imaging,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20357"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Rempel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Berkeley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Moos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison A.

These data indicate that TTFields with GnP warrant phase 3 evaluation. Methods: PANOVA-3 (NCT03377491) is a prospective, randomized, phase 3 trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of TTFields concomitant with GnP in patients with LAPC. The planned enrollment is 556 patients. Eligibility criteria include unresectable LAPC (per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and no prior progression or treatment. Patients will be stratified by performance status and geographical region, and randomly assigned 1:1 to TTFields plus GnP or GnP alone. Based on a recent protocol amendment, a smaller and lighter-weight (reduced from 6 to 2.7 lbs) TTFields device will be used. Standard doses of nab-paclitaxel (125 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) and gemcitabine (1000 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) will be administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. TTFields (150 kHz) will be delivered &#8805; 18 h\/day until local disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V1.1. Follow-up will be performed every 4 weeks and a computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen every 8 weeks. After local disease progression, patients will be followed every month until death. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), local PFS, objective response rate, 1-year survival rate, pain- and puncture-free survival rate, rate of resectability, quality of life, and toxicity. The sample size was estimated per log-rank test comparing time to event in patients treated with TTFields plus GnP with published clinical trial data on patients treated with GnP alone. PANOVA-3 is designed to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 in OS. Type I error is set to 0.05 (2-sided) and power to 80%. The trial is currently recruiting at 104 sites in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and USA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b2d808d2-b3b5-466c-8215-c26964021da3\/@w03B8ZYY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-03 Phase III clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),PANOVA-3,Phase 3 trial,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20361"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Vincent J.

MDM2<i> <\/i>induces degradation of p53 and promotes tumorigenesis. <i>MDM2<\/i> amplification occurs in many cancers but is documented in up to 100% of well-differentiated or de-differentiated liposarcomas (WD\/DDLPS) [Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. Cell 2017]. Inhibition of the MDM2-p53 interaction is a promising therapeutic approach to restore p53 tumor suppressor activity in WD\/DDLPS. Milademetan (RAIN-32) is a small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor that inhibits the MDM2-p53 interaction and restores p53 function at nanomolar concentrations. In a phase 1 study, milademetan showed promising efficacy in 53 patients with WD\/DDLPS when administered on an intermittent schedule (260 mg QD on Days 1-3 and 15-17 on a 28-day cycle), with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.4 months [Gounder et al. AACR-NCI-EORTC 2020]. WD\/DDLS are relatively resistant to chemotherapy, and systemic treatment options for patients with advanced disease are limited. MANTRA (RAIN-3201) is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 registration study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of milademetan versus trabectedin in patients with unresectable or metastatic DDLPS with disease progression on &#8805;1 prior systemic therapies.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients are &#8805;18 years of age with histologically confirmed unresectable and\/or metastatic DDLPS, with or without a WD component, who have received &#8805;1 prior systemic therapies, including &#8805;1 anthracycline-based regimen, with radiographic evidence of progression by RECIST v1.1 within 6 months before study entry. Prior treatment with trabectedin or an MDM2 inhibitor is not permitted. Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive milademetan (260 mg once daily orally Days 1-3 and 15-17 on a 28-day cycle) or trabectedin (1.5 mg\/m<sup>2 <\/sup>as a 24-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Randomization is stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 or 1) and number of prior treatments for WD\/DDLPS (&#8804;2 or &#62;2). Tumor response will be evaluated by RECIST v1.1 at Weeks 8, 16, 24, and 32, and then every 12 weeks. Primary endpoint: PFS by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints: overall survival; disease control rate; objective response rate; duration of response; PFS by investigator assessment; safety; health-related quality of life. Exploratory endpoints: molecular markers in peripheral blood and\/or tumor tissue; milademetan pharmacokinetics. To demonstrate a 3-month increase in PFS (from 3 to 6 months) corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.5, approximately 160 patients will be required to observe 105 events with 93.9% power and 2-sided significance level of 5%.
