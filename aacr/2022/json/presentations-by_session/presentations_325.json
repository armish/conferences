[{"Abstract":"Purpose: Data are lacking on the distribution, factors associated with, and long-term impact of diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at diagnosis in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors (&#8805;2 years post cancer diagnosis). Our goal was to fill this gap in knowledge.<br \/>Methods: A cohort of AYA (15y - 39y) cancer patients treated at MD Anderson between 2000-2016 who had survived at least 2 y was identified from our Institutional Tumor Registry. HRQoL was assessed at diagnosis with the SF12v1 questionnaire. Demographic and behavioral risk factors, tumor type, and vital status were ascertained. Physical composite summary (PCS) and mental composite summary (MCS) scores were generated from SF12 responses following mean-based normalization; PCS or MCS &#60; 50 indicated &#8220;poor&#8221; HRQoL. Statistical tests included ANOVA, quantile regression, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards.<br \/>Results: 2,609 AYA cancer survivors (75% diagnosed between age of 26-39 y; 67% White, 18% Hispanic and 9% Black) were included. Breast cancer was the most frequent diagnosis (25%), followed by sarcoma (12%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (10%). Median follow-up for participants was 10.5 y. Overall mean PCS and MCS scores at diagnosis were 45.3 (SD: 11.4) and 47.0 (SD: 10.5), respectively. Female AYA cancer patients had significantly higher PCS, yet lower MCS compared to their male counterparts (both P&#60;0.001). A positive association between age at diagnosis and PCS was observed (P&#60;0.001), in contrast to the inverse association with MCS (P&#60;0.001). Differences in PCS (P&#60;0.001) and MCS (P=0.001) were also evident by tumor type. For example, women with breast cancer reported the most favorable PCS (51.5) at diagnosis, yet among the lowest MCS (46.1) of the nine tumor types analyzed. The Black AYA population had a larger burden of poor PCS at diagnosis with 61% of patients reporting scores &#60;50 compared to 55% of Hispanic and 51% of non-Hispanic whites. Significant predictors of diminished PCS in AYA cancer survivors in the bottom 25% of PCS scores were younger age at diagnosis (P=0.003), male gender (P&#60;0.001), diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy versus solid tumor (P&#60;0.001), smoking (P=0.003) and not consuming any alcohol currently (P&#60;0.001). Overall, low PCS (&#60;50) at diagnosis (HR=1.57, P&#60;0.001), and diagnosis of a solid tumor compared to a hematologic malignancy (HR=2.33, P&#60;0.001) were associated with lower survival.<br \/>Conclusions: In this large, diverse AYA cancer survivor cohort, physical and mental HRQoL at diagnosis were impacted by AYA&#8217;s age at diagnosis, gender, tumor type, and smoking status. Low PCS at diagnosis was an independent predictor of diminished survival among AYA cancer survivors &#8805;2y post diagnosis. Our findings suggest that patient-reported poor physical well-being at diagnosis is a biomarker of poor prognosis for AYA cancers. Further studies are needed to identify interventions to improve outcomes for this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0789c273-6b75-412a-8038-a1486f891d16\/@x03B8ZCc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-01 Adolescent and young adult oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Survival,Cancer,Solid tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12168"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Goldy C.

However, there have been few population-based estimates of cancer risk among children with well-described patterns of recurrent multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs). VACTERL association is one such pattern that is defined by the presence of &#8805;3 of the following in the absence of a genetic diagnosis: <u>v<\/u>ertebral defects, <u>a<\/u>nal atresia, <u>c<\/u>ardiac defects, <u>t<\/u>racheo<u>e<\/u>sophageal fistula, <u>r<\/u>enal, and <u>l<\/u>imb anomalies. VACTERL occurs in approximately 5% of children with Fanconi anemia (FA), a known cancer predisposition syndrome. In spite of this, there are no population-based estimates of cancer risk in children with VACTERL. Therefore, we investigated if VACTERL confers an elevated risk of pediatric cancer by examining a birth cohort of &#62;7 million children from three U.S. states (Texas, North Carolina, and Oklahoma) for the period 1997-2013.<br \/>Methods: Demographic and diagnostic data from birth certificates, birth defects registries, and cancer registries were linked in each state and pooled for analysis. For this analysis, children with chromosomal anomalies were excluded. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the risk of cancer before 19 years of age in three birth defect groups: (1) VACTERL; (2) &#8805;3 major anomalies but not VACTERL; and (3) 1 to 2 major anomalies. A hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each group for: (1) overall cancer risk and (2) risk of embryonal tumors (e.g., neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, hepatoblastoma) based on reported associations between birth defects and these pediatric cancers.<br \/>Results: In our cohort of 7,767,786 births, we identified: 2,090 children (0.02%) with VACTERL; 32,558 children with &#8805;3 non-VACTERL defects; and 201,871 children with 1 to 2 defects. Respectively, these three groups had 10, 167, and 684 cases of cancer. Compared to children without birth defects, children with VACTERL (HR=3.9, 95% CI: 2.1 - 7.2), &#8805;3 non-VACTERL defects (4.2, 3.6 - 4.9), and 1 to 2 defects (2.7, 2.5 - 2.9), were all more likely to develop cancer. Risk was higher for embryonal tumors among children with VACTERL (10.4, 4.7 - 23.1) than for those with &#8805;3 non-VACTERL defects (5.6, 4.2 - 7.4) or 1 to 2 defects (3.9, 3.4 - 4.5).<br \/>Conclusion: In this population-based assessment, we demonstrated that children with VACTERL were more likely than other groups to develop cancer, particularly embryonal tumors, although the absolute cancer risk was &#60;1%. Surprisingly, acute myeloid leukemia, a common malignancy among individuals with FA, was not diagnosed in any of the children with VACTERL, suggesting these associations are distinct from FA. These findings demonstrate that VACTERL subtypes and other recurrent MCAs may represent novel cancer predisposition syndromes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/52119790-fca7-4580-8dfd-8d5eac92b0d0\/@y03B8ZCd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Pediatric cancers,Birth Defects,VACTERL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12167"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander Renwick<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy M.

The adenovirus Delta-24RGD and the imipridone ONC201 have demonstrated safety and effectiveness in preclinical models and clinical trials. Thus, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of the Delta-24-RGD\/ONC201 combination and analyzed possible changes in the tumor microenvironment in preclinical models of pHGGs and DMGs.<br \/>Experimental procedures: A battery of pHGGs (SF188 and CHLA-03-AA), human DMG (SU-DIPG IV), and murine DMG cell lines (XFM and NP-53) were used. We assessed the viral replication by hexon titration, the protein expression amount (E1A, fiber, and mTORC1 key proteins)by immunoblotting, and oxygen consumption by Seahorse Analyses. Viability was measured by MTS. CHLA-03-AA and XFM were engrafted orthotopically in athymic nude mice and Balb\/c mice, respectively. To assess<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vivo<\/i> efficacy, the animals were treated with Delta-24-RGD (10<sup>7<\/sup> PFU\/animal) or PBS, followed by ONC201administration (125 mg\/kg\/twice\/weekly). The tumor immune microenvironment was evaluated by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: First, the potential adverse interactions between both agents were checked<i> in vitro,<\/i> showing that ONC201 cotreatment did not interfere with the Delta-24-RGD replication capacity. As expected, ONC201 treatment led to a reduction in oxygen consumption, which was also observed in the combination treatment. Evaluation of cytotoxicity in a panel of cell lines showed that the combination was significantly better than either agent alone.<i> In vivo<\/i>, CHLA-03-AA bearing mice treated with the combination showed a significant increase in the median overall survival (PBS: 48 days; ONC201: 54.5 days; Delta-24-RGD: 62 days; Delta-24-RGD\/ONC201: 95 days (<i>P=0.0008<\/i>)), leading to 20%long-term survivors, free of disease. Evaluation of the combination in an immunocompetent orthotopic DMG model also revealed the superior efficacy of the Delta-24-RGD\/ONC201 (PBS: 11 days; ONC201: 12 days; Delta-24-RGD: 12 days; ONC201+Delta-24-RGD: 15 days (<i>P=0.02<\/i>)). Of importance, the combination treatment resulted in the reshaping of the tumor microenvironment towards a proinflammatory phenotype (T cells, NK cells, macrophages, granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and microglia).<br \/>Conclusions: Our data indicate that the combination Delta-24-RGD\/ONC201 generates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that ultimately leads to a superior therapeutic effect in preclinical pHGG and DMGs models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/430a4e7c-a3b5-499b-b4f1-78383d7e05b1\/@y03B8ZCd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ONC201,Oncolytic adenovirus,Pediatric cancers,Brain tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12153"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel De la Nava<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javier Marco-Sanz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virginia Laspidea<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Labiano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iker Ausejo-Mauleon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reyes Hernandez-Osuna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Mueller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javad Nazarian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua E.

The median survival of DMG patients is only 9 months, being the leading cause of pediatric death caused by a brain tumor. On this project we set to characterize the efficacy of Delta-24-RGDOX, an oncolytic adenovirus based on Delta-24-RGD platform, which has demonstrated safety and a therapeutic benefit in different pediatric tumors, armed with the ligand of OX40. The binding of OX40 to OX40L leads to the co-stimulation of CD4 and CD8 cells, generating effector and memory T cells. Therefore, the aim of this project is to improve the antitumor effect of the virus, providing a greater co-stimulation in the tumor.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: Murine and human DMG cell lines were used. Viral protein expression was measured by western blot, viral replication was analyzed using a method based on hexon detection and the oncolytic effect by MTS assay. OX40L expression was measured by flow cytometry and qPCR. For in vivo<i> <\/i>experiments, cells were injected in the pons of mice using a screw-guided system. The adenovirus was administered once into the tumor using the same procedure. Tumor immune populations were analyzed by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: We first confirmed the oncolytic effect of Delta-24-RGDOX in DMG murine and human cell lines in vitro. The virus was able to infect the cells, produce viral proteins, and to cause cell death in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we observed effective viral replication in human cell lines but not in mouse cells, as previously described. We then measured OX40L expression in infected cells both at protein and mRNA level, observing that at 50 PFU\/cell almost 100% of cells expressed the ligand on their membrane. More importantly, the OX40L was functional as it activated CD8 lymphocytes in vitro. Once we confirmed that the viral administration in vivo was safe, we assess the efficacy of the virus in murine DMG models. We observed a significant survival benefit in mice bearing NP53 tumor treated with Delta-24-RGDOX, which lead to 30% of long-term survivors (<i>P=<\/i>0.003, median OS PBS 25.5 days vs 35.5 days for treated mice). More importantly, we administered the virus in an already stablished tumor model using XFM cells and also obtained a significant improve of survival (<i>P=<\/i>0.018, median OS PBS 9 days vs 12.5 treated mice). Finally, we analyzed the immune mechanisms underlying the survival benefit, both in the tumor and in spleen. We observed a significant increase of activated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment 7 days after the viral administration. In addition, splenocytes from virus-treated mice were also significantly more activated.<br \/>Conclusions: These data show that Delta-24-RGDOX adenovirus expresses a functional OX40L that can modulate the immune response, leading to a significantly improved survival outcome in DMG models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/285acb9a-2b46-4d73-a518-0ada36ae6548\/@y03B8ZCd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Pediatric cancers,Brain tumors,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12173"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Virginia Laspidea<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Labiano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sumit Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iker Ausejo-Mauleon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel De la Nava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc García-Moure<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javier Marco-Sanz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reyes Hernández-Osuna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oren J Becher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Fueyo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Patiño-García<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Candelaria Gomez-Manzano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta M Alonso<\/i><\/presenter>.

We sought to characterize genetic risk factors for sepsis among individuals with DS-ALL.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed a germline genome-wide association (GWAS) study for sepsis among 264 subjects with DS-ALL treated on Children&#8217;s Oncology Group (COG) protocols AALL0932 (N=181) and AALL1131 (N=83), for newly-diagnosed standard risk and high risk B-ALL, respectively. Sepsis was defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.0), with a microbiologically confirmed grade 4 or 5 sepsis event reported during any phase of treatment to define the case and comparison groups. Germline genotyping on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 or Illumina Omni 2.5Exome arrays was imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel and filtered for quality control. Logistic regression models were used to compare individuals with DS-ALL who experienced sepsis to those who never developed sepsis during treatment. Models were adjusted for principal components of population structure and COG protocol. Analyses included autosomal variants with a minor allele frequency &#62;1% and excluded chromosome 21.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified 29 individuals (10.9%) with DS-ALL who developed one or more sepsis events during treatment. In genome-wide analyses, we observed 52 variants in eight genomic loci associated with sepsis at <i>P<\/i>&#60;10<sup>-5<\/sup> among individuals with DS-ALL. Our top signal was rs77917748 (<i>P<\/i>=6.02x10<sup>-7<\/sup>), an intronic variant in a regulatory region of <i>TMEM163<\/i>, a protein that is essential for zinc homeostasis. Additionally, we identified a strong linkage signal at rs56288508 on chr6p21.2 (<i>P<\/i>=5.29x10<sup>-6<\/sup>). According to data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, this locus is associated with whole blood expression of <i>ZFAND3<\/i>, a zinc finger protein and transcriptional regulator. Additionally, this variant is associated with intestinal infections (<i>P<\/i>=0.012) in the UK Biobank. Finally, a third variant we identified in our GWAS is on chr6q24.2 (<i>P<\/i>=4.33x10<sup>-6<\/sup>) and shows strong linkage in GTEx with peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression of <i>APOBEC3A<\/i>, a viral deaminase that lacks zinc binding activity. Notably, this variant is associated with respiratory failure (<i>P<\/i>=0.0099) in the UK Biobank.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We identified evidence of genetic associations for sepsis risk in DS-ALL. These findings suggest zinc homeostasis may be an important factor mediating risk of sepsis during treatment of individuals with DS-ALL.

Despite a 90% five-year survival rate, survivors of childhood ALL often suffer from late effects, including cardiometabolic disorders. Contributing factors such as inflammation and oxidative stress, combined with drug treatments, can induce premature aging and cellular senescence with a significant impact on cardiometabolic disorders. Premature aging can lead to decreased thymic T-cell production, resulting in decreased circulation of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). Because diet has been associated with cardiometabolic disorders, we hypothesized that the quality of diet in children who had survived ALL was related to the immune aging biomarker TREC, in concert with inflammatory status.<br \/>Methods: Adolescent and young adult survivors of pediatric ALL of the PETALE cohort (n=241, 22.1 &#177; 6.3 years at diagnosis, 49.4% male) were examined in their profile for TREC levels (by qPCR) and for adherence to 6 diet quality indices.<br \/>Results: Adjusted linear regressions revealed that the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) was associated with TREC levels (&#946;=50.0, p=0.005, adjusted p=0.03). After performing a conceptual relational analysis (CAR) for data mining of various biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, endotoxemia, and endothelial or adipose dysfunction; interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were found to be negatively associated with TREC levels (&#946;= -80 and -80.1, p=0.017 and 0.026, respectively) but not with HDI. Further analysis revealed that IL-6 and CRP levels were moderators, but not mediators, of the association between HDI and TREC.<br \/>Conclusion: This study supports the positive impact of a healthy diet on premature immune aging and the moderating role of inflammation in this association.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/45720062-c11d-48d5-82a2-8c1484435b8c\/@y03B8ZCd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-05 Survivorship, late effects, and second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diet,T lymphocytes,Aging,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12171"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Abderrahim Benmoussa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tibila Kientega<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia Morel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guillaume Cardin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Bérard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mickael Wajnberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petko Valtchev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandre Blondin-Masse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Curnier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maja Krajinovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Laverdière<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Sinnett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emile Levy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Marcoux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francis Rodier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valérie Marcil<\/i><\/presenter>.

IJC, 2020) and perform in depth molecular analysis (WES, RNAseq, array-based DNA methylation profiling) and central pathology review. Between April 2019 and July 2020, 71 patients were recruited from nine sites within six European countries. In total, 48 patients were evaluable. The remainder (32%) failed quality control, mainly due to poor quality of the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Median age at diagnosis was 19 years (range 6 to 28 years), including 25 cases of newly diagnosed sarcoma and 23 cases of recurrent sarcoma.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Central pathology review was performed for all evaluable patients. The local diagnosis was confirmed in 41 cases (85.4%) and changed in 7 cases (14.6%), including new diagnoses of BCOR sarcomas (n=3) and teratoma (n=1). DNA methylation analysis was performed for all cases with adequate DNA (n=46), and profiles were categorized according to the Heidelberg classifier (Koelsche et al., Nature Communication, 2021). The classifier confirmed the diagnosis of central pathology in 32 cases (69.6%). The remaining cases showed discrepancies mainly due to poor DNA quality. Whole-exome and RNA sequencing were performed on all samples where DNA and\/or RNA quality permitted (98% and 48% respectively).Pathology and molecular profiling results were discussed at a monthly combined clinico-pathological tumor board, with the goal of adapting treatment strategies based on molecular profile either for this treatment episode or for future progression. Actionable molecular alterations were identified in 39 cases. Treatment was adapted in 3 cases and confirmed in 1. Treatment was not adapted in the remainder because they were undergoing primary treatment (n=14), undergoing an alternative treatment for progression (n=10), due to death prior to molecular tumor board (n=10) or loss to follow-up (n=1).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Despite expected logistic challenges associated with sample quality and analysis, actionable alterations were identified in 81.2% of evaluable patients, confirming that there is an unmet clinical need in this population. Moreover, we have identified remediable organizational factors to reduce sample failures and increase the turnaround speed of recommendations in this overlooked AYA cancer population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/791f0a20-d186-4060-ba77-36e964fa3452\/@y03B8ZCd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-01 Adolescent and young adult oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Personalized medicine,Screening,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12148"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marie Morfouace<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Horak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Kreutzfeldt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Shenjere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Wardelmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evgeniya Denisova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Stevovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco J.

With MLN8237 no longer being developed due to toxicities related to AURKB inhibition, testing of a highly selective AURKA inhibitor, LY3295668, is warranted.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>LY3295668 (Chemie Tek) and venetoclax (Selleck Chem) were tested alone and in combination in six NB PDX models using 2-3 mice\/arm. Five Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models tested (COG-N-424x, COG-N-453x, NB-1643, Obelix-Rx and Obelix-2x) were <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified and one xenograft model (SK-N-AS) was MYCN-non-amplified. First, a comprehensive toxicity study, testing LY3295668 at 30mg\/kg with venetoclax at 100mg\/kg, 75mg\/kg, 50mg\/kg, and 25mkg\/kg, was performed. Based on tolerability of combination, an optimal dose of 30mg\/kg for LY3295668 and 50mg\/kg for venetoclax was selected and administered once daily, seven days a week, via oral gavage for 60 days. These were the maximum tolerated doses when tested in combination, that did not result in weight loss greater than 15% or other overt signs of toxicity.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>LY3295668 (30mg\/kg) and venetoclax (50mg\/kg) were well tolerated as monotherapy, and when administered in combination showed a maximum weight loss of 13%. Single agent therapy resulted in minimal if any growth delay. Four of five <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified PDX models demonstrated maintained complete responses and one showed significant tumor growth delay. No effect was observed in the <i>MYCN<\/i>-non-amplified model with single agent or combination treatment compared to vehicle.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Dual targeting of AURKA and BCL2 with LY3295668 and venetoclax is tolerable and demonstrates compelling anti-tumor activity in <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified NB PDX models, validating our earlier findings (<i>Ham et al)<\/i>. These preclinical results provisionally support clinical development of this combination for NB patients with <i>MYCN<\/i> amplification.

Osteosarcoma is the most frequent bone tumor and it mainly affects children and adolescents. The main treatment option is a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Research into new therapeutic strategies to improve the quality of life of patients is currently underway. The development of the anti-tumor immunostimulant drug Mifamurtide is part of this research. There are very conflicting opinions on the therapeutic validity of this drug. Therefore, we tested experimentally the effectiveness of Mifamurtide in three cell lines of osteosarcoma (MG-63, HOS, 143B) with different grades of malignancy, grown in co-culture with macrophage to allow the correct internalization of the drug. Through in vitro experiments, we analyzed the effects of Mifamurtide on tumor cell viability, on cellular signaling pathway and on macrophage polarization. Results show that Mifamurtide loses its effectiveness as the tumor malignity increases. The most aggressive tumor cells are not affected by the therapy, probably because they implement methods of resistance to apoptosis. Furthermore, they would be able to affect the tumor microenvironment to their own advantage.<b> <\/b>To better understand Mifamurtide impact on tumor microenvironment, we also performed a cytokine assay on the culture medium in which the cells grew. The most significant results were identified in the interleukine-10 (IL-10): IL-10 is expressed in higher quantities in the highest-grade osteosarcoma cells. This anti-inflammatory cytokine can inhibit the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokine and suppresses the antigen presentation capacity of APC cells. This allows cancer cells to evade immune surveillance mechanisms. In vivo and in vitro results show that the synergic use of an anti-IL-10 antibody in combination with Mifamurtide can improve its efficacy. Here, we provide experimental evidence that the addition of an anti-IL-10 antibody to Mifamurtide causes a significant death rate in more aggressive osteosarcoma cells and lower metastasis, compared to Mifamurtide only. In conclusion, considering our data, it could be proposed a new treatment protocol for metastatic osteosarcoma that includes the use of an anti-IL10 antibody integrated with the administration of Mifamurtide to increase its effectiveness in this clinical context.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0c474cd-c865-4eee-875d-cc0a2fd15ca7\/@z03B8ZCe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Macrophages,Interleukin-10,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12152"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicoletta Nastasi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Subbiani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Letizia Taddei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucia Scala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Tamburini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudio Favre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maura Calvani<\/i><\/presenter>.

Beside surgical resection established treatment options are lacking for FL-HCC. Recently, the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript was identified as the oncogenic driver of tumor pathogenesis in 100% of FL-HCC patients. Here, we investigated the role of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion protein as a source for immunogenic neoepitopes and showed first immunotherapeutic application of these antigens in a FL-HCC patient.HLA class I- and class II-presented neoantigens derived from the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion protein were predicted <i>in silico<\/i> using NetMHCpan 4.1 and SYFPEITHI 1.0, or NetMHCIIpan 4.0, respectively. With this workflow nine binding cores of nine amino acid length for a total of 1290 different HLA class II alleles, as well as 13 HLA class I ligands for the 20 most frequent HLA class I allotypes (European population, iedb.org) were identified. Cellular processing and HLA presentation of DNAJB1-PRKACA-derived peptides was proven by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) of <i>DNAJB1-PRKACA<\/i>-transduced HCC cell lines. Immunogenicity of DNAJB1-PRKACA-derived peptides was assessed for the HLA class II peptide (P<sub>II-1<\/sub>) and the HLA-A*24 peptide (P<sub>A*<\/sub>24) by <i>in vitro<\/i> priming experiments which showed an induction of multifunctional peptide-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, respectively, with expression of CD107a, IFN&#947;, and TNF upon peptide-pulsing. Furthermore, P<sub>A*24<\/sub>-specific T cells showed antigen-specific lysis of autologous peptide-loaded target cells and single-cell next-generation sequencing (10x Genomics) of P<sub>A*24<\/sub>-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells further enabled the identification of DNAJB1-PRKACA-reactive T cell receptors. Based on these preclinical data we applied a peptide vaccine, consisting of three HLA class I ligands (P<sub>A*02<\/sub>, P<sub>B*44<\/sub>, and P<sub>C*05<\/sub>) and P<sub>II-1 <\/sub>spanning the<sub> <\/sub>DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion region, to a 15-year old patient with histologically confirmed FL-HCC, who experienced multiple tumor relapses after early liver transplant due to unresectable FL-HCC not responsive to chemotherapy. After two vaccinations <i>in vivo<\/i> induction of multifunctional CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells targeting P<sub>II-1 <\/sub>and P<sub>B*44<\/sub> was observed by IFN&#947; ELISPOT. Single-cell RNA sequencing of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells revealed distinct gene expression clusters of T cell activation and high TCR clonality. DNAJB1-PRKACA-specific T cells persisted in peripheral blood and were accompanied by relapse free survival of the patient until now, more than one year post vaccination. These findings identified the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript as novel prime source for broadly applicable neoepitopes and corresponding TCRs and provide first evidence for their application in cancer immunotherapy of FL-HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8eb80ade-9ca0-4d63-b9c4-8b10614c57fe\/@z03B8ZCe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion proteins,Mass spectrometry,Cancer immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12155"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jens Bauer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Köhler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yacine Maringer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Bucher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatjana Bilich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Zwick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Severin Dicks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annika Nelde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marissa Dubbelaar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Scheid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcel Wacker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas J.

MPNSTs respond poorly to most chemotherapeutics due to molecular heterogeneity and altered signal transduction pathways. Ref-1 and STAT3 are highly expressed in MPNST patient samples offering druggable pathways. Inhibition of one singular protein, like Ref-1 to block the activity of many important transcription factors (TFs), STAT3, HIF1a, and NFkB is key to improving success in MPNST therapy. Inhibition of both Ref-1 and STAT3 in MPNST lines resulted in decreased proliferation, wound healing, tumor signaling, and deactivation of MPNST survival genes. Further, knockdown of Ref-1 or STAT3 resulted in a concordant decrease in NFkB activity. Ref-1 redox inhibitor, APX3330 that completed Phase I clinical trial (NCT03375086), potently inhibited <i>in vitro<\/i> growth of a panel of MPNST cells. We have also been developing new more potent analogs of APX3330 for inhibition of Ref-1 redox function and potent cell killing in our panel of MPNST cells. Several of these analogs significantly and potently reduced NFkB and HIF1a activity at concentrations where cell killing was minimal, pointing toward an on-target effect. Based on the role of Ref-1 in transcriptional regulation of MPNST, RNA sequencing after knockdown of Ref-1 was used to determine mechanistic effects on MPNST gene expression. We have identified 443 genes up-regulated and 758 genes down-regulated in two MPNST cell lines with siRef-1. The pathways enriched by the commonly up-regulated genes included RNA polymerase, P53 downstream, glycerophospholipid, and other lipid metabolism pathways; the pathways enriched by the commonly down-regulated genes included cell cycle, adaptive immune response, and VEGF signaling pathways. From this data, we also found that OXPHOS (Oxidative Phosphorylation) pathway genes (like NDUFS2, SURF1, COX15) were down with siRef-1 along with others like AURKA, RNASEH2A, CDC20, GINS4, TIMELESS that were identified in our previous publication to be MPNST survival genes. Based on our published observations that Ref-1 inhibition dramatically affects metabolic pathways, we used OXPHOS deficient and proficient osteosarcoma cells and confirmed the impact of Ref-1 redox activity on metabolism. Furthermore, if we combine Ref-1 inhibition with a-ketoglutarate (aKG) and target the tumor cells&#8217; dependence on aspartate biosynthesis, the tumor cell death was dramatic (p &#60; 0.0001). Two new xenolines were established from patient PDXs and are being validated for growth inhibition and downregulation of MPNST survival genes with Ref-1 knockdown and redox inhibition using APX analogs both in vitro and in vivo. Successful derailing of MPNST survival pathways by targeting Ref-1 redox function is our aim to treat this rare but deadly cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/59d899f6-8989-4b19-90df-ad721b4e2c96\/@z03B8ZCe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Redox,Transcription factor,Targeted therapy,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12156"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Silpa Gampala<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Babb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikkitha Umesh Ganesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven D.

Clinically approved MEK inhibitors are effectively used to target RAS-pathway driven cancers in combination with RAF inhibitors in <i>BRAF<\/i> mutant cancers such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. However, single agent treatment with MEK inhibitors is not typically sufficient for clinical benefit. Therefore, combination therapy approaches will be required for maximal efficacy in most advanced cancers. Here, we sought to identify MEK inhibitor-based combination therapy approaches in the setting of <i>RAS<\/i>-mutant neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a cancer that arises in the developing peripheral nervous system. Children with low-risk disease frequently benefit from therapy, but 50-60% of children with high-risk disease will ultimately relapse, and relapsed disease is generally incurable. We performed genome-scale functional genomic drug modifier screens and identified mediator kinase module members <i>CCNC <\/i>and <i>CDK8<\/i> as two genes that when lost sensitize <i>RAS<\/i>-mutant NBL to MEK inhibition. We used small molecule inhibitors of CDK8 and found that combined inhibition of MEK and CDK8 leads to an improved therapeutic response <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> in a xenograft model of neuroblastoma. Using transcriptional profiling, we established that CDK8 loss and MEK inhibition induce opposite transcriptional signatures. When combined, CDK8 loss prevents the compensatory upregulation of the pro-growth gene expression program induced by MEK inhibition, while the downregulation of MAPK signaling is maintained. Finally, we show that this combination is effective in a subset of other <i>RAS<\/i>-mutant cancers including pancreatic and lung cancers. Together these data suggest that the mediator kinase module is critical for the adaptive pro-survival transcriptional response induced by MEK inhibition in <i>RAS<\/i>-mutant neuroblastoma and other RAS-driven malignancies, and that the addition of a CDK8 inhibitor may improve clinical response to MEK inhibitors. Our data supports a model where agents with antagonistic transcriptional programs can have synergistic therapeutic effects when combined, which may be a broadly relevant approach in combination therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/992a2282-06ff-4370-acc1-1b446f3e6a43\/@z03B8ZCe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-06 Therapeutic dosing, resistance, and combination therapy approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,MEK inhibitor,CDK8,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12157"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Clare F.

Thus, there is a critical need to identify therapies targeting specific molecular signatures in OS. Hyperactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4\/6) has been identified by us and others as a top actionable marker in OS. CDK4\/6 binds to cyclin D resulting in a complex that mediates RB phosphorylation leading to cell cycle progression. While CDK4\/6 inhibitors (CDK4\/6i) have shown promise clinically, one drawback is that CDK4\/6i induces cell cycle arrest rather than cell death. Furthermore, prolonged CDK4\/6 inhibitor therapy can confer therapeutic resistance in RB1-proficient (RB+) tumors where compensatory pathways such as PI3K\/mTOR are activated. To mitigate such CDK4\/6i resistance in OS, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of CDK4\/6 and PI3K pathways will promote cytotoxicity in hyperactivated CDK4\/6 OS models. RB+ OS cell lines and a TT2-77 xenoline were evaluated in vitro. Combination index and Bliss independence analyses indicated that inhibition of OS growth by exposure to CDK4\/6i (Palbociclib or Abemaciclib) and PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor (PI3K\/mTORi-Voxtalisib or LY3023414) was additive-to-synergistic and lead to increased apoptosis at clinically relevant concentrations. Short-term pharmacodynamic study of vehicle- versus Palbociclib-treated TT2-77 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) was analyzed by global\/phospho-proteomics and kinome profiling. RB1 and MKI67 phosphopeptides as well as the total protein levels of CDK1 were reduced by Palbociclib, thus, confirming modulation of the cell cycle. Kinome profiling analysis of PDX from Palbociclib-treated mice indicated<b>&nbsp;<\/b>increased activity of AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase linked to PI3K pathway activation. Increased activity of the autophagy marker PIK3C3 was also evident. OS PDX models TT2-77 and HT96 (RB+, CDKN2Anull, CCND3 amplified) were treated with Palbociclib (50 mg\/kg), Voxtalisib (50 mg\/kg) or Palbociclib + Voxtalisib. In TT2-77 PDXs treated for four weeks, tumor growth was significantly reduced in single-agent and combo groups compared to vehicle (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05, Two-way ANOVA; Holm-Sidak). We observed a trend that the combo was more efficacious than single agent, but statistical differences were not evident. Increasing the dosing timeline to six weeks may be beneficial. In HT96 PDXs, tumor growth was significantly decreased in single-agent and combo groups compared to vehicle. Notably, Palbociclib + Voxtalisib was more efficacious than single-agent (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05, Two-way ANOVA; Holm-Sidak). These data highlight the need to optimize CDK4\/6i+PI3K\/mTORi dosing schedules and provide evidence that Palbociclib + Voxtalisib therapy is safe, efficacious, and can decrease CDK4\/6i resistance in aggressive PDX models of OS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/034979d5-c652-4995-9a9c-8ea9d30daa61\/@z03B8ZCe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,PI3K,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12158"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Farinaz Barghi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pankita H Pandya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>M.

Despite intensive multi-modal therapy, 5-year survival rates for patients with high-risk disease remain at approximately 50%. Neuroblastomas typically have low mutational burden and harbor few recurrent mutations making the identification of new therapeutic targets challenging. To characterize the proteomic landscape of high-risk neuroblastoma, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based deep expression proteomics and phosphoproteomics on 30 neuroblastoma tumors from 26 patients with high-risk disease. Our integrated analysis identified four distinct proteomic subgroups of high-risk neuroblastoma that were not otherwise apparent based on clinical or genomic features. The four subgroups were named based on their defining proteomic signature: C1-Mixed, C2-Neuronal, C3-Functional MYCN and C4-Stromal. Only one third of C3-Functional MYCN tumors had amplification of MYCN. Segmental chromosomal losses and gains were enriched in, but not exclusive to, C1-Mixed and C3-Functional MYCN tumors. The activities of multiple kinases including CDK2, CDK7 and MEK2 differed significantly between subgroups. C3-Functional MYCN and C4-Stromal tumors were enriched for immune and stromal cells, respectively. Focal adhesion signaling was specifically upregulated in C4-Stromal tumors suggesting increased extracellular matrix interactions in this tumor subgroup. C2-Neuronal tumors were enriched for axon guidance and neurotrophin signaling pathways. Rho family GTPase signaling was also evident in multiple tumor subgroups. C1-Mixed and C3-Functional MYCN tumors had elevated expression of RNA processing proteins which was associated with increased alternative splicing. Splicing analysis also identified multiple novel protein coding splice events that were shared amongst multiple neuroblastoma tumors and outliers compared to both the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset and a panel of commercial reference tissues. Protein domain analysis of these novel splice variants suggested that these novel protein isoforms may have aberrant functions that contribute to tumorigenesis. In conclusion, phosphoproteomic analysis can identify candidate pathways for the development of new therapies for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e4212e07-182e-43d5-ab25-d1d7466a4bb3\/@z03B8ZCe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Proteomics,Splice variants,Kinases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12160"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kristin L.

Some CMN patients develop a highly proliferative multinodular phenotype leading to chronic intense pruritus, and the causes for that specific phenotype progression are poorly understood. Genotypically CMN are mosaic single gene disorders. Thus far only two recurrent variants have been described as clearly causative: <i>NRAS<\/i> missense variants affecting codon 61 accounting for 68% of cases, and <i>BRAF<\/i> missense variants affecting codon 600 accounting for 7% of cases. Small numbers of cases of CMN have been reported to carry gene-fusions, and in 2 cases in the world literature (one <i>BRAF<\/i>-fusion and one <i>RAF1<\/i>-fusion) these have been shown to be clonal and therefore likely causal. We sought to address the issue of causation of the remaining 25%. From an initial large cohort study, skin biopsies from 19 patients were shown to be double wildtype for <i>NRAS\/BRAF<\/i> and had sufficient tissue for further study after deep whole exome sequencing. These 19 samples then underwent transcriptome-wide paired-end RNA sequencing with bioinformatics analysis (STAR-Fusion v1.6 and Fusion Inspector v2.3) for gene fusion transcripts. 11\/19 patients were found to have <i>BRAF<\/i>gene fusions, of which 7 had the multinodular proliferative phenotype. Fusions were confirmed on Sanger sequencing of the cDNA across the fusion junction, specifically demonstrated in 8 children from more than one separate skin lesion, confirming clonality. In the fusions identified, <i>BRAF<\/i> was fused to 11 different partner genes (<i>GOLGA4, QKI, STRN3<\/i>, <i>AGAP3, MKRN2, PHIP, LCA5, EEA1, AKAP9, SEC31A, MIER3<\/i>). This resulted in loss of the 5&#8217; regulatory domain of <i>BRAF<\/i> but preservation of the kinase domain, such that expression was driven by the 5&#8217; fusion partner. This structure follows the pattern of somatic <i>BRAF<\/i>-fusions reported previously in solid tumors including melanoma. Potential dimerization domains in the partner genes were identified in 9 cases. We identify here mosaic <i>BRAF<\/i> fusions as a recurrent cause of multiple CMN allowing genetic diagnosis in a further 15% of cases and linking this genotype to a highly proliferative pruritic phenotype.<i> In vitro<\/i> data from melanoma cell lines have suggested that higher expression levels of the fusion protein as well as dimerization domains in the partner gene correlate with resistance and\/or paradoxical MAP-kinase activation after treatment with RAF and MEK inhibitors. This may have implications for the use of targeted therapies for attempted reduction of the nodular phenotype, or where melanoma arises in CMN patients caused by mosaic <i>BRAF<\/i>-fusions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58bbcc1e-e5da-484d-84b3-551561e8f8d3\/@r03B8ZCf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-06 Therapeutic dosing, resistance, and combination therapy approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Genetic mosaicism ,MAP\/ERK signalling pathway,Gene fusion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12162"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara Barberan Martin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satyamaanasa Polubothu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alicia Bruzos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil Bulstrode<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gavin Kelly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Kinsler<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this project, we have investigated the prognostic potential of Aurora kinase expression in ES patients and evaluated the activity of Aurora kinase inhibitors in ES cell lines and patient derived cultures.<br \/>The prognostic value of Aurora kinase A (AURKA), Aurora kinase B (AURKB) and Aurora kinase C (AURKC) was determined through interrogation of the online GSE17618 dataset using Cox models and Kaplan Meier plots. RNA seq data was obtained from the CCRG dataset for expression analysis (Roundhill et al., 2021, Cell Oncol, 44(5), 1065-85). Viable cell number was determined using the trypan blue exclusion assay on the Vi-CELL XR. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of inhibitor (Table 1) or DMSO vehicle control for 48h. Protein was extracted after 48h for western blotting.<br \/>In ES patients, high RNA expression of AURKA and AURKB is associated with a 5- and 3-fold increased risk of death respectively (n=42). Risk of an event was increased 3- or 2-fold with high expression of AURKA or AURKB respectively (n=42). High AURKC expression was not prognostic. Expression of AURKA and AURKB was confirmed at the RNA level in ES cell lines and patient derived cultures, and at the protein level in cell lines. Aurora kinase inhibitors (Table 1) decreased viable cell number of ES cell lines and patient derived cultures. Western blotting confirmed a decrease in AURKA and MYC-C expression with increasing concentration of inhibitor. AMG900 was the most potent inhibitor in TC32 cells (Table 1) and decreased viable cell number of patient derived cultures (n=5, p&#60;0.01).<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{F539A901-D85C-408F-8823-C90DB95F2A6C}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Aurora Kinase Inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Concentration Range Used (nM)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Target Kinases(IC50, nM)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">EC50 TC32 Cells (nM) (n=3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P value (EC50 AMG900 vs EC50 another inhibitor)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">References<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AMG900<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.25-50<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AurA (5), AurB (4), AurC (1) + 10 kinases<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.57<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Payton et al., 2010, Cancer Res, 70(23), 9846-54<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MLN8237<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5-300<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AurA (1.2), AurB (396.5) + 22 kinases<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29.48<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0468<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Manfredi et al., 2011, Clin Cancer Res, 17(24), 7614-24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CCT137690<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5-300<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AurA (15), AurB (25), AurC (19) + 3 kinases<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">97.56<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0004<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Bavetsias et al., 2010, J Med Chem, 53(14), 5213-28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">LY3295668<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">31.25-1000<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AurA (0.8) AurB (1038)AurC (98) + 2 kinases<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not able to calculate<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gong et al., 2019, Cancer Discov, 9(2), 248-263<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\">Table 1.

Due to the high unmet medical need in this indication, there is an urgent requirement to identify respective osteosarcoma cell-surface antigens and evaluate the antitumor activity of an ADC that can deliver tailored cytotoxic payloads to osteosarcoma tumors expressing these targets.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used an integrated proteomic and transcriptomic surfaceome profiling approach to identify cell-surface proteins that are highly expressed in osteosarcoma but minimally expressed on normal tissues. uPARAP (MRC2) was found to be enriched in osteosarcoma at both protein and mRNA levels. The cell-surface expression of uPARAP (MRC2) was further validated by IHC and flow cytometry with osteosarcoma cell lines, PDX models, and patient tumor tissue microarray. As a proof of concept, three MRC2 targeted ADCs with different Microtubulin- and alkylating agent types of payloads were tested in 8 osteosarcoma PDX models. uPARAP (MRC2) ADC, control ADC, or vehicle control was administered IV to mice harboring flank tumors at a dose of 3mg\/kg, weekly X 3 (ADCE-003), 2mg\/kg on Day 1 (ADCE-010), and 10mg\/kg weekly X 2 (ADCE-011). EFS for treatment (T) and control (C) groups, minimum relative tumor volume (minRTV), and objective response measures were analyzed.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Western blotting confirmed the expression of uPARAP (MRC2) in 8 osteosarcoma cell lines and 8 PDX models. Flow cytometry further validated cell-surface localization and expression levels of uPARAP (MRC2) in 7 osteosarcoma cell lines. We then performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining using an osteosarcoma tissue microarray from 37 patients and 19 PDX models. uPARAP (MRC2) was expressed in 97% of the patient samples and 95% of the PDXs. 51% of the patient samples and 39% of the PDXs had an overall H-score of 100 or higher. Mice tolerated ADCs well with minimal toxicity. All 3 ADCs significantly prolonged EFS in 6\/8 osteosarcoma models. Complete response (CR) or maintained CR were observed in 2 models in ADCE-010 and ADCE-011 groups, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> uPARAP (MRC2) is highly expressed in most osteosarcoma samples, which makes it a viable target for respective antigen targeting ADC therapies.

The survival rate for metastatic and relapsed OS patients is &#60;30% and there is currently no standardized salvage therapy. Lack of efficacy is attributed to extensive genetic complexity present in OS that is partly due to moderate levels of replication stress (RS). While high levels of RS can induce cell death, moderate RS levels may cause genomic instability that contributes to progression of OS. Therefore, induction of RS to high levels, especially in genetically complex cancers like OS, could be a promising therapeutic strategy. Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins (BRD2,3,4) are a family of epigenetic readers that not only regulate gene expression networks, but also regulate DNA replication and RS. BRD4 directly regulates major factors involved in DNA replication and checkpoint signaling. Thus, disruption of BRD4 function should exacerbate RS to levels that cause cell death. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that BET inhibition potentiates the efficacy of current salvage therapy through RS induction in aggressive OS. The effects of BET inhibitors (BETi), AZD5153 and OTX-015, as single agents and in combination with drugs used in salvage therapy such as topotecan were evaluated for effects on OS cell growth, PARP cleavage, and the DNA damage repair network. BET knockdown experiments were performed to evaluate target selectivity and dependency. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy and safety studies focused on patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of relapsed OS. TT2-77 xenoline, Saos2, G292, and U2OS cell lines were selected for <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments. Combination index and Bliss independence analyses demonstrated additive to synergistic cell growth inhibition upon treatment with clinically relevant concentrations of BETi+topotecan. Significant increase in PARP cleavage was observed in the combination compared to single agent, indicating enhancement of apoptosis. Moreover, Western analyses demonstrated that BETi induces its effect, at least partly, via decreased CHK1 activation and increased DNA damage. Selective siRNA treatments illustrated that transient knockdown of individual BET proteins was not sufficient for potentiation of topotecan-induced cell death in OS cells, indicating that simultaneous knockdown of BETs may be required. Dose-finding studies of AZD5153 in relapsed OS PDXs that harbor replication stress signatures (TT2-77 and PDX96) indicated that daily doses of 1.25 or 2.5 mg\/kg AZD5153 were well tolerated and effective in partially suppressing tumor growth compared to vehicle (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05, Two-way ANOVA; Holm-Sidak). <i>In vivo<\/i> combination treatments of BETi+topotecan are in progress. These data collectively suggest that BET inhibition alongside salvage therapy holds promise as a novel treatment strategy for inducing RS-mediated cell death in aggressive OS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2f1d86dd-825c-4da7-b85a-509a131ac671\/@r03B8ZCf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Replication Stress,BET inhibitors,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12170"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Niknam Riyahi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pankita H.

Though several genomic drivers have been identified, the development of targeted therapy for treating this aggressive pediatric malignancy has yet to be realized. Thus, there exists an urgent need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies for treating aggressive and metastatic NB. One novel approach is to therapeutically target anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which are multi-functional tyrosine kinases implicated in neural development and play an important role in growth and metastasis of several cancers. Genomic aberrations of ALK such as overexpression, amplifications, and mutations, have been reported in NB. The role of FAK has also been delineated in NB as well as associated with disease metastasis. Using in silico analysis of sequencing data from NB patients procured from Pediatric MI-ONCOSEQ (precision oncology program), we found a cohort of patients that express high ALK and FAK expression. Given the potential roles of ALK and FAK in NB, we evaluated the efficacy of a novel compound ESK440, which is a dual ALK and FAK inhibitor. ESK440 has passed Phase 1 clinical trials in adult patients with solid tumors. It is capable of crossing the blood brain barrier and binds to several mutated forms of ALK, thus making ESK440 an attractive therapeutic candidate for treating NB. A wide panel of NB cancer cell lines were screened with ESK440, and a CellTiter-Glo&#174; Luminescent Cell Viability Assay was used to determine the IC-50s. Our results revealed that NB cells with ALK genomic aberrations (mutations and amplifications) showed low IC-50 values. Further, treatment with ESK440 inhibited ALK and FAK associated signaling pathways. We also observed decreased expression of MYCN. Intriguingly, ESK440 studies in NB xenograft model (NB-1) resulted in tumor regression in treated animals. Altogether, our study has discovered the therapeutic potential of dual ALK and FAK inhibitor in NB, and our findings may provide the foundation for initiating clinical trials targeting this disease in pediatric patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a19d1506-5f73-4fde-8e38-528b72fdadff\/@r03B8ZCf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Neuroblastoma,Therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12172"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seema Chugh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean C.

While it is expressed minimally on normal tissues, it is expressed on nerve cells and, anti-GD2 (dinutuximab) treatment can cause neuropathic pain. To increase tumor specificity, we developed a bispecific SNIPER antibody to simultaneously target two tumor antigens (GD2 and B7H3). B7H3 is overexpressed on multiple tumor types, with minimal expression on most normal cells and is absent on nerve cells. The goal of this SNIPER is to enhance tumor-specificity, while reducing toxicity, ultimately improving efficacy for cancers expressing both targets.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: SNIPER specificity was tested by flow cytometry for binding to GD2 +\/- B7H3 expressing cells. Using an Incucyte S3, we tested antibody internalization properties [compared to anti-B7H3 and dinutuximab monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)] and antibody dependent cellular-cytotoxicity (ADCC) capabilities. Mice bearing variants of GD2\/B7H3-expressing tumors were intravenously injected with <sup>89<\/sup>Zr- radiolabeled SNIPER and its longitudinal <i>in vivo<\/i> biodistribution was monitored via positron emission tomography imaging. <i>In<\/i> <i>vivo<\/i> efficacy studies of SNIPER were tested against mice bearing either melanoma or neuroblastoma tumors that express both GD2 and B7H3.<br \/>Summary of Data: <i>In vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor specificity testing confirmed that SNIPER specifically targets B7H3+\/GD2+ cells, but it does not bind to GD2+\/B7H3- cells (which simulate nerve cells). We observed high internalization of anti-GD2 mAbs; we did not observe antibody internalization of either the SNIPER or anti-B7H3 mAbs. SNIPER was as effective at ADCC as the dinutuximab, but we saw minimal ADCC with the anti-B7H3 mAbs. An afucosylated version of SNIPER showed significantly enhanced ADCC compared to dinutuximab. Our <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy studies found that SNIPER was as as dinutuximab when given at the same dose.<br \/>Conclusions: The Fab arms of SNIPER targeting GD2 and B7H3 each have low-to-moderate affinity. SNIPER binds with strong avidity when both arms bind to their antigens on the same cell. Stronger avidity through both arms binding results in high-tumor specificity. Because SNIPER should not bind to nerves, it may be possible to administer increased doses of SNIPER beyond the tolerable dose of dinutuximab, which could further improve efficacy. Ongoing studies include antitumor efficacy testing, nerve binding assays and assessing reduction of pain in vivo with SNIPER.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/45a9f9cb-127b-44ea-bdd9-00150e8cc7e0\/@r03B8ZCf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-02 Childhood cancer drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Neuroblastoma,Toxicity,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12175"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amy K.

It is the most frequent STS in children and accounts for around 5-8% of total childhood cancers. The improvement of chemotherapeutic regimens has raised RMS survival chances over the last decades. However, the mortality rate remains exceptionally high in high-risk RMS patients. Duocarmycins have arisen as an opportunity for targeted therapy in cancer. These ultrapotent anticancer agents have been reengineered to generate bioprecursors that are selectively activated bycertain cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (e.g. CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2W1). The overexpression of these isoforms in tumors provides the possibility to locoregionally bioactivate duocarmycin prodrugs only in the tumor site. Previous studies have shown that duocarmycins can be chemically modified and deactivated by removal of a hydroxyl group in the pharmacophore, which can be reinstalled by CYPsto generate a potent DNA-targeted cytotoxic metabolite. In the past, a consistent CYP2W1overexpression in patient-derived RMS biopsies as compared to matched, non-transformed tissue was revealed.<br \/>Results: Ongoing studies are focused on measuring CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and CYP2W1 expression levels in RMS cell lines and in three-dimensional spheroids as well as evaluating the antiproliferative activity of duocarmycin bioprecursors in these models. With the exception of RH30 cells (IC50=0.2&#181;M forICT2700) the IC50 for CYP1A1- and CYP2W1-bioactivated duocarmycins (ICT2700 and ICT2706,respectively) lie in the low micromolar range in RMS monolayer cultures, suggesting that CYP1A1 andCYP2W1 might not be a suitable target in these 2D cancer models. Consistently, only RH30 cells displayed a high CYP1A1 expression in monolayer cultures among the RMS cell line panel, and noCYP2W1 expression could be identified. However, preliminary data suggests that CYP1A1 and CYP2W1enzymes might be restored when spheroids are generated from RMS cell lines. A functional 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay has been validated to analyze CYP1A1- and CYP1B1-specific enzymatic activity in RMS cell lines. Vorinostat (SAHA) is an epigenetic drug currently used in the clinic for cancer treatment, and it has been associated with modulatory effects on CYP1expression. Our data suggests cell line-dependent synergistic or antagonistic effects of SAHA when combined with ICT2700, and these correlate with SAHA-induced CYP1A1 upregulation and downregulation respectively at both gene and protein levels.<br \/>Conclusion: Evaluation of CYP target expression in RMS is being established to assess if duocarmycin bioprecursorscan be progressed as a novel type of therapy in RMS. Interestingly, CYP450 expression in RMS cell lines seems to vary depending on the complexity of the in vitro model used.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad86a531-ac78-42c7-9828-563102de27b0\/@r03B8ZCf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Cytochrome P450,Drug sensitivity,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18393"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Enric Arasanz Picher<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Klaus Pors<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here we describe a case of an adolescent with a constitutional pathogenic <i>BRCA2 <\/i>variant who was diagnosed with a Wilms tumor and developed PEL while undergoing treatment. We provide evidence that both malignancies are distinct and arose from the same clone. A 16-year-old boy presented with a diffusely anaplastic Wilms tumor metastatic to liver. He was treated with radical nephrectomy, partial hepatectomy, radiation, and multiagent chemotherapy. Six months into treatment he developed new lung and liver lesions along with cytopenias. A bone marrow aspirate confirmed a diagnosis of PEL. His disease progressed after one cycle of myeloid leukemia-directed chemotherapy and he died of disease shortly after. Samples from his initial renal tumor, blood at Wilms tumor diagnosis, and diagnostic bone marrow for PEL were characterized by whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing. Two sequence variants were shared in both tumors but were not found in the constitutional tissue (blood at first presentation): a promoter variant in <i>TERT <\/i>(c.-124C&#62;T) and a missense variant in <i>PDE4DIP <\/i>(p.Gln1045His). Although neither variant has been reported in Wilms tumor or PEL, the <i>TERT <\/i>variant has been well described in other tumor types and is associated with decreased survival in some carcinomas. Both tumors also had pathogenic <i>TP53 <\/i>variants albeit a different one in each tumor (p.Arg175His in the Wilms tumor, p.Asp228* in PEL). Loss of heterozygosity at <i>TP53<\/i> was present in both malignancies via copy number loss of 17p with a shared breakpoint. Furthermore, while both malignancies had complex and distinct karyotypes, 7p loss and 22q loss with identical breakpoints were present in both. None of these variants or copy number variants were present in constitutional tissue. RNA sequencing data confirmed the histologic finding that these were distinct malignancies as the expression patterns for each malignancy were consistent with previously published expression data for Wilms tumors and myeloid leukemias respectively. Although the patient had a constitutional pathogenic <i>BRCA2<\/i> variant, loss of heterozygosity at that locus was not found in either tumor. Chromosome fragility testing for Fanconi anemia was uninterpretable due to the concomitant use of chemotherapeutic agents at the time of testing, however the patient had no phenotypic features to support this diagnosis. In this case there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting that a Wilms tumor and PEL arose from the same clone including shared <i>TERT <\/i>variants and copy number variant breakpoints. Kidney and hematopoietic tissue both arise from the embryonic mesoderm suggesting that the earliest alterations occurred in this tissue. The contribution of each shared pathogenic variant (<i>TERT<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, 17p loss) to tumorigenesis and the role of chemotherapy in PEL development are still under investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6451be4a-0018-4652-9ba4-d718404f6b0b\/@s03B8ZCg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Clonal evolution,Genetic susceptibility,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20555"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Anita Villani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Winnie Lo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yisu Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed Abdelhaleem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Shago<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federico Comitani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>My Linh Thibodeau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Alexander<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uri Tabori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Malkin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Shlien<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jack Brzezinski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Pharmacometric tools are proposed as powerful quantitative techniques to leverage and integrate the collected data from pediatric clinical trials. Here we demonstrate and discuss the applications of nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) models through a detailed example of oral vinorelbine (VNR) in pediatric cancers.Methods:A multicentric, open-label, single-arm intervention phase II study was conducted. Patients with recurrent\/progressive Low-Grade Glioma (LGG), were included. Patients received 60 mg\/m&#178; of oral VNR on days 1, 8 and 15 during the first 28-day treatment cycle and 80 mg\/m&#178; from cycle 2 to 12. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed using a NLME modeling approach on Monolix&#174;. Fifty SNPs on PK-related genes were genotyped. The Influence of demographic, biological and pharmacogenetic covariates on VNR PK parameters was investigated using a stepwise multivariate procedure.Results:PK analysis included 36 patients with a median age (range) of 11 (6-17) years. A three-compartments model, with a delayed double zero-order absorption and a linear elimination, best described VNR pharmacokinetics. Typical population estimates (between-subject variability, between-occasion variability) for the apparent central volume of distribution (Vc\/F) and elimination rate constant (k<sub>10<\/sub>) were 803 L (47%, 41%) and 0.60 h<sup>-1<\/sup> (18%, 16%), respectively. Lower area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) levels were observed among children in comparison to adults. Following covariate analysis, BSA, leukocytes count, and ABCB1-rs2032582 SNP showed a dramatic impact on Vc\/F. Additionally, ABCG2-rs2725264 A\/G or G\/G carriers and UGT2B7-rs7668258 T\/T carriers showed higher k<sub>10 <\/sub>values. Conversely, age and sex had no significant effect on VNR PK.Conclusion:Higher doses may be necessary for children with LGG. A personalized dosing strategy, using BSA, leukocytes and ABCB1-rs2032582 SNP, could help to optimize the efficacy\/toxicity balance of VNR in children. Model-informed drug development enabled efficiently a better understanding of PK of oral VNR in children and identifying several factors likely to explain the variability in VNR exposure and subsequent clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0c5ad56-1b01-469d-a422-8db740690fc9\/@s03B8ZCg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-02 Childhood cancer drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,vinorelbine,p-glycoprotein,pediatric drug development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20752"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mourad HAMIMED<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre LEBLOND<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurélie DUMONT<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florence GATTACCECA<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emmanuelle TRESCH-BRUNEEL<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alicia PROBST<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pascal CHASTAGNER<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne PAGNIER<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilie DE CARLI<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natacha ENTZ-WERLÉ<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacques GRILL<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle AERTS<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Didier FRAPPAZ<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Isabelle BERTOZZI-SALAMON<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline SOLAS<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas ANDRÉ<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Joseph Ciccolini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
