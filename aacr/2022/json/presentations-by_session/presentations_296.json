[{"Abstract":"Context: There is a growing interest in drug repurposing and pathological complete response (pCR) that may influence the progression and treatment of breast cancer (BC). However, few studies focus on the influence of comedications, i.e., non-anticancerous drugs taken for coexisting conditions in cancer patients on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and even less regarding the impact of response to treatment and relapse in breast cancer.<br \/>Objectives: To assess whether the use of comedications modifies pCR and patient relapse probability in BC.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris, France). Characteristics from 664 patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Response to chemotherapy was assessed by pathological complete response (pCR). We analyzed comedication according to levels 1 and 2 of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC). A chronic comedication was defined by a comedication declared at diagnosis, excluding local and\/or non-continuous administration. To estimate the average causal effect of comedication on pCR, we employed Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Super Learner strategy to pick the best regression model. We used a Cox multivariate regression model to analyze the average causal effect of comedications on relapse probability.<br \/>Results: 664 patients were included in this study. The median age at inclusion was 51.4 years. Of 664 patients, 194 patients (29.2%) had at least one comedication (433 total comedications). The repartition of comedications, according to the 1st level of ATC, was as follows: Cardiovascular system (C): 40.2% (n=174), Nervous system (N): 23.8% (n=103) and Alimentary tract and metabolism (A): 15.2% (n=66). Among the population with collected pCR, 112 tumors achieved pCR (18 .6%). After IPW adjusted for clinical, pathological, and treatment variables, C03 (Diuretics) was associated with an increased likelihood of positive pCR (C03 versus no C03, OR = 5.0, CI95% [1.25-12.2]). By contrast, N06 (Psychoanaleptics) was associated with a decrease in pCR rates (OR= 0.3, CI95% [0.1-0.6]). The multivariate survival analysis showed a significant effect on the relapse probability of Selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, NO6) (OR = 2.3 CI95% [1.2-4.4], p = 0.01).<br \/>Discussion: In this observational analysis, the use of chronic cardiovascular diuretics (C03) during NAC was associated with improvement of pCR rates. On the contrary, Psychoanaleptics (N06) were significantly associated with lower pCR rates and a higher probability of relapse. This finding prompts for further research on the interactions between chemotherapy, nervous system drugs such as SSRIs, and pathological complete response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8e41d9c2-eec5-4e2d-9006-3632971d8665\/@s03B8ZAp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Chemotherapy response,Comedications,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15475"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anne-Sophie Hamy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amyn Kassara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hamid Hocini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clementine Garin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Teixeira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Cuvier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Gougis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elise Dumas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabien Reyal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Grandal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadir Sella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Daoud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurélien Latouche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thierry Dubois<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annabelle Ballesta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samar Alsafadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elaine Del Nery<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Élodie Anthony<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Marande<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cedric De Bazelaire<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne De Roquancourt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Michel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvie Giacchetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Espie<\/i><\/presenter>.

Many factors, including psychological stress, define the onset\/progression of the disease. Although psychological stress can cause several health problems, preclinical and clinical reports regarding its role in cancer have been mixed. Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine the role of psychological stress hormone in the progression of T cell lymphoma and provide a mechanistic framework of activity. Initially, we used the cBioportal and performed expression analysis of genes involved in stress pathways with large-scale cancer genomics TCGA datasets having nearly 10071 patient samples. Through a series of in-silico investigations, we identified Adrenoceptor Beta 2 (ADRB2), a key mediator of stress, highly expressed in T cell lymphoma compared to other tumors.Furthermore, the expression of ADRB2 was not gender-specific and equally represented in both males and females. String analysis further identified the interaction of ADRB2 with Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 20 (USP20), which directly regulates Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-A) and ADRB2. This regulation could lead to enhanced glucose metabolism to support T cell lymphoma growth and progression. Collectively, our in-silico findings suggest that psychological stress releases hormones that could modulate T cell lymphoma proliferation through the ADRB2-USP20 axis. Ongoing preclinical studies with stress hormones will be presented to provide undescribed mechanisms of their protumorigenic activity through the ADRB2-USP20 axis and their role in regulating cancer-specific metabolism. We sought to determine the role of psychological stress hormone These studies will provide an opportunity to learn the involvement of stress hormones in cancer progression and provide a framework for developing a novel approach for stress management during cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c06e8539-a78d-4819-a250-bf6b682e0c3e\/@s03B8ZAp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endocrine resistance,T cell,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Endocrine\/neuroendocrine cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rajan Kumar Tiwari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>.

Kozlov, 2014]. Indeed, <i>TSEEN<\/i> (tumor specific evolutionarily novel) genes were described by us [Kozlov, 2016]. 1015 genes were identified by the Protein Historian program as evolutionary novel for humans, that is, originated in humans, and 1392 as evolutionarily young, that is, originated in primates. As a result of analyzing the GTEx database data, we have shown that out of 1015 evolutionarily new human genes and 1392 evolutionarily young human genes, 309 genes and 592 genes are not expressed in any of 33 normal tissues, respectively. The expression level of 101 evolutionarily new human genes originated in humans and 233 evolutionarily young human genes originated in primates is significant in most tumors, according to transcriptome data from the TCGA database. Samples of 101 evolutionarily novel human genes and 233 evolutionarily young human genes were selected, which are present only in the genomes of humans and primates, not expressed in normal tissues, and expressed in one or more tumors in 10-100% of patients.For Theria and Eutheria, the similar distribution was as follows: among 365 and 896 genes novel for these taxons, 71 and 124 genes, respectively, are not expressed in normal human tissues, respectively , but at the same time have tumor-specific expression pattern (inclusion criteria of expression - fpkm &#62;2 in 10-100% of patients).There are also 898 genes, originated in mammalia and not expressed in normal human tissues. 119 of them are expressed in at least 1 or more tumors in 10-100% of patients.The <i>TSEEN<\/i> genes database allows [us] to select genes according to their evolutionary age and expression pattern in normal and tumor tissues. We can retrieve gene(s), which are expressed tumor-specifically and are evolutionarily young or novel.As far as TSEEN genes have many immunogenic epitopes they could be promising targets for development of universal prophylactic and therapeutic antitumor vaccines, as well as universal markers for cancer laboratory diagnostics.<i>Created TSEEN<\/i> genes database is available at: https:\/\/tseendb.org\/#\/","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Expression profiling,Tumor markers,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),Tumorigenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15522"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ekaterina Matyunina<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrei Makashov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrei P.

It is an emerging view that dysregulation of major signaling pathways, including Notch signaling, contributes to breast cancer development and progression, but precisely how and in which subtypes Notch signaling is hyperactivated still largely remains to be determined. To gain further insights into dysregulation of Notch in cancer, we set out to identify and evaluate a novel Notch transcriptomic signature focusing initially on breast cancer. We first established Notch-regulated transcriptomes from six breast cancer cell of the basal subtype in response to activation of Notch (by culturing on immobilized Notch ligand) or blockade of Notch (by &#947;-secretase inhibitors) for 8 and 72 hours. Our data reveal that a core set of Notch-responsive genes can be identified from both time-points and we are validating the transcriptomic signature on a broader set of additional 19 breast cancer cell lines from various breast cancer subtypes. The Notch transcriptomic signature showed robust coherence scores in breast cancer patient data, and robust correlation with basal-like transcriptomes was demonstrated. Analysis of single cell transcriptomic data from breast cancer patients demonstrated that the Notch signature showed additionally good correlation with immune cells in the tumor stroma, notably tumor associated macrophages, indicating that Notch signaling is upregulated in specific cell types of the tumor stroma. Collectively, the data provide a robust transcriptional signature to read out activation of the Notch signaling pathway in basal-like breast cancer and the signature will be important to better stratify patients and to evaluate and predict outcome of future Notch-based therapies for breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a3352dea-a804-4b9d-8d09-60965fab5643\/@s03B8ZAp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Notch,Signaling,Expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15546"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Eike-Benjamin Braune<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Felix Geist<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dirk Wienke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anita Seshire<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Urban Lendahl<\/i><\/presenter>.

Identifying these structural variations is central to defining CLL pathogenesis, risk stratification, and therapeutic approaches. Fluorescence <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization (FISH) is the clinical gold standard in detecting prognostic CNVs in CLL. However, next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have become more readily available for clinical genomic applications and can also be used to identify CNVs. Here we present bioinformatic methods to accurately identify CNVs in CLL using NGS data.<br \/>We used the CNV-calling algorithm PatternCNV to detect clinically relevant CNVs: deletion 17p13 [del(17p)], deletion 11q23 [del(11q)], deletion 13q14 [del(13q)], and trisomy 12. PatternCNV was run on 2274 samples (1500 somatic and 774 germline samples) from six different sequencing batches, screened using a targeted sequencing panel that covers all exons of 59 recurrently CLL mutated genes and additional amplicons covering the minimal affected regions of relevant CNVs. To correct for potential batch effects, PatternCNV was initially run to quantify exon coverage behavior without the chromosomes containing recurrent CNV events, 11, 12, 13, and 17. Principal component analyses and correlation matrices were analyzed, grouping the samples into four distinct clusters that contain similar exon coverage patterns. Samples in each of the four clusters were then independently re-run through PatternCNV using all chromosomes. Visual analysis of CNV plots revealed a bias in normalization. To correct this, the log2ratios were corrected to center the log ratio on the median coverage. Sample noisiness was calculated from the difference in the median absolute deviation (DiffMAD) and samples with a DiffMAD score greater than 0.3 were excluded. All CNV analyses were blinded to clinical FISH results.<br \/>The effectiveness of our CNV calling was evaluated in 522 CLL patients who had FISH conducted within three months of the sample date. We excluded samples with low tumor metrics identified by FISH (less than 20% of cells with either del(17p), del(11q), trisomy 12 or del(13q)). When we compared our CNV analyses with the FISH data, we found high concordance 99.6% for del(17p), 97.5% for del(11p), 99.1% for trisomy 12, and 93.7% for del(13q). N=46 total discordant pairs were identified, with the highest discordance for del(13q), N=28, followed by del(11q), N=12.<br \/>These novel bioinformatic methods allow for accurate detection of CNVs across NGS sequencing batches. The high concordance in detecting CNVs between targeted NGS and the gold standard of FISH, suggest NGS is an accurate tool for calling CNVs in CLL. Further, NGS can infer clinically relevant CNVs in genomic locations not targeted by FISH.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7f22cf83-0415-45b6-af09-1a7d5582d4f8\/@s03B8ZAp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Copy number variation,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15547"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chantal E.

To address this question and define a high-confidence set of oncRNAs, we used smRNA-seq data from 6 cancer sites (breast, colorectal, kidney, liver, lung, and stomach) and their corresponding normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; 4,445 cancer, 431 normal) and identified a total of 144,695 oncRNAs that are significantly present in cancer and largely absent in normal tissue (Fisher&#8217;s Exact Test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction, FDR &#60; 0.1).<br \/>To evaluate if this set of TCGA-derived oncRNAs could be validated in independent datasets, we examined smRNA-seq data from two large independent cohorts comprising these same cancer and normal tissue types (Indivumed, Hamburg, Germany). Cohort A consists of 4,024 samples (2,245 cancer, 1,779 normal) and cohort B consists of 2,874 samples (2,063 cancer; 811 normal). oncRNAs in these cohorts were annotated following the same procedure used for TCGA data. TCGA-derived oncRNAs were considered validated in the independent cohorts if they were present in a significantly higher number of cancer samples compared to adjacent normal tissue samples. In cohort A, 140,191 (96.9%) of TCGA-derived oncRNAs were detected in at least one sample, of which 74,634 (51.6%) were validated as oncRNAs. In cohort B, 140,147 (96.9%) oncRNAs were observed and 68,366 (47.2%) were validated. The degree of overlap between the validated oncRNAs in each cohort was significant, with 54,294 (37.5%) overlapping oncRNAs (hypergeometric test, P=0).<br \/>We also found that oncRNAs are informative of cancer tissue of origin, demonstrating the existence of consistent cancer-specific oncRNA expression profiles in independent studies. Using the TCGA-derived oncRNAs as features, we trained an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model on TCGA data to classify cancer samples by the 6 tissues of origin. The TCGA-trained model showed high performance when evaluated on both cohorts A and B, achieving accuracies of 91.5% (95% CI: 90.3%-92.7%) and 96% (94.7%-97%), respectively. For comparison, this model achieved an accuracy of 96% (94.5%-97.2%) on held-out TCGA data (80\/20 train\/test split). Our results show a robust validation of TCGA-derived oncRNAs in external, independently sourced and processed cancer tissue cohorts across a heterogeneous set of cancer sites. Our machine learning model also demonstrates that oncRNA profiles can be used to predict cancer tissue of origin with high generalizability and accuracy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/db2c16dc-678b-4a29-9705-b8973564264b\/@s03B8ZAp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Noncoding RNA,Machine learning,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15548"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeffrey Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helen Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Fish<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly H.

Using data from a prospective study with measured serum cholesterol among men subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer, we developed a tumour gene expression score to reflect the pre-diagnosis serum cholesterol environment these tumours developed in, and applied this score to a separate study to examine the relationship with prostate cancer-specific outcomes. We identified 127 men with prostate cancer in the prospective Health Professionals Follow-up Study, whose prostate tumors underwent whole genome gene expression profiling. Pre-diagnosis serum cholesterol was measured a median of 3.3 years (IQR 1.5-4.8 years) prior to cancer diagnosis. We excluded men using statins either at time of blood draw for serum cholesterol measurement or at cancer diagnosis. Using tumor biopsy whole genome transcriptomic data from 232 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy in Northern Ireland (NI), we generated the serum cholesterol score by summing z-score-transformed expression for each gene. PTEN status was measured using a published 50-gene transcriptional signature. Both signatures were dichotomized using the median cut-point. Age-adjusted and multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compute HRs and 95% CI for associations of the cholesterol gene score with biochemical recurrence and metastasis risk. We identified in HPFS a set of 30 genes associated with pre-diagnostic serum cholesterol with a fold change &#8805;4 which included <i>PTEN<\/i>. In the NI Cohort, tumors with above median cholesterol scores had higher expression of the PTEN-null signature (p&#60;0.001). Increased serum cholesterol tumor score was associated with higher Gleason grade (p&#60;0.001); this relationship was stronger in PTEN-null tumours relative to PTEN-intact. Over a median follow-up of 11 years, 68 men experienced biochemical recurrence, and 28 developed metastasis. In age-adjusted analysis, patients with high serum cholesterol score had increased risk of recurrence (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.13-2.99) and metastasis (HR 1.98; 95% CI 0.91-4.29), though the latter was not statistically significant. Associations with recurrence and metastasis were attenuated following further adjustment for Gleason score (HR 1.65; 95% CI, 0.98-2.77 and HR 1.49; 95% CI 0.66-3.35, respectively). Men with increased tumor gene expression of a serum cholesterol score, derived to reflect tumor development within a high serum cholesterol environment, were more likely to be diagnosed with a PTEN-null prostate cancer. These men had more aggressive prostate cancer at diagnosis and increased risk of recurrence, particularly men with PTEN<i>-<\/i>null disease. Our results support recent findings showing a reduced risk of PTEN-null prostate cancer in statin users, and inform our understanding of the potential role of serum cholesterol in prostate cancer etiology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/658c7b57-edb7-4735-8360-e2f7a4c71d83\/@s03B8ZAp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Metabolism,Cholesterol,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15550"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah Jane Winter<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia R.

While several approaches have been proposed to dissect the cellular heterogeneity using profiling data such as gene expression or methylation, it remains challenging to discover rare cell types from high-throughput sequencing data. To address this need, we apply a novel approach in which we hypothesize that rare cell subpopulations might be detected based on the expression of differential sets of transcripts, generally expressed at low levels proportional to the infiltrating cell percentage. In this case, the challenge is the precise measurement of gene expression at low levels or the detection of genes specifically attributable to those cell populations as being &#8220;off&#8221; or &#8220;on&#8221;.<br \/>Methods: We propose a novel computational approach for measuring the &#8220;offonome&#8221;, defined as a gene&#8217;s dichotomized state of being &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off&#8221;. To accurately determine on\/off status of a gene, we compare single nucleotide-level RNA-seq data modeled as vectors in high dimensional data space using the angles between samples. In this framework, sample vectors determined to have low angles can be defined as sharing an &#8220;on&#8221; gene versus sample vectors with high angle defining a state of &#8220;off&#8221;. We apply this approach to more than 5,000 human cancer samples drawn from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify minor cell populations. Additionally, we compare this approach to the alternative gene abundance strategy in which on\/off is defined by read-counts-based gene expression estimates from the same dataset.<br \/>Results: Using the overall and sub-populations, we identified minor cell populations across the TCGA dataset including in a sub-cohort of 522 TCGA head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The Offonome approach applied genome-wide in HNSCC identified 5802 genes that were either always or sometimes &#8220;off&#8221; defined by angle-based statistics. Turning our attention to genes that were sometime, but not always off, we applied unsupervised learning to characterize clusters of genes within HNSCC tumors. At least five gene clusters were clearly observed, each of which was strongly associated with specific signaling pathways. For example, one cluster identified infiltrating myocytes, defined by infiltrating normal muscle cells, found only in tumors of the oral tongue. In addition to clustering analysis, we utilized the approach to identify high expression of genes found in outliers, or even a single sample such as those associated with salivary origin such as olfactory receptors.<br \/>Conclusions: We conclude that on\/off status of a gene provides new insights into gene expression deconvolution, thereby characterizing interesting gene clusters. These results offer strong evidence that our approach can be useful for picking up rare transcripts from individual samples such as leukocyte transcripts and stromal transcripts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f2707df7-4153-4f76-a1a7-3a7f73a916b9\/@s03B8ZAp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression,Tumor heterogeneity,Microenvironment,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15563"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hyo Young Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David N.

The disease is the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with 685,000 deaths in 2020. Approximately 75% of all breast cancer are ER&#945; positive and resistant to current therapies like aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) and selective receptors modulators (SERMs). The selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERDs) ability to antagonize and degrade ER&#945; makes them promising therapeutic agents for hormone-refractory breast cancer treatment. Fulvestrant is the only SERD with steroidal core currently approved for ER-positive breast cancer treatment. However, its poor physicochemical properties limit its efficacy. Many non-steroidal SERDs such as Amcenestrant, Elacestrant, Camizestrant, Giredestrant, and LSZ102 are under various advanced development stages. However, their long-term efficacy is yet to be established. Our <i>in- silico<\/i> studies aim to evaluate and compare multiple SERDs (approved and under trial) in terms of their shape similarity, binding mechanism, and stability with ER&#945; receptor.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Present work focuses on evaluating and comparing the shape similarity and electrostatic potential of various SERDs with respect to ER&#945; endogenous ligand; estradiol (E2). Docking studies were performed to understand the binding mode of selected SERDs within the active site of ER&#945;. Additional parameters like root-mean square-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean square-fluctuation (RMSF), pocket volume fluctuations, and protein-ligand binding energy were calculated using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation techniques to understand the stability and binding mechanism of various SERDs.<br \/><b>Result<\/b>: Among various evaluated SERDs, Fulvestrant shares the highest whereas Elacestrant shares the lowest shape similarity with E2. All docked SERDs cores occupy the same binding pocket and tend to bind in a similar fashion as E2, with their tail protruding towards helix 12 (H12). As observed interactions with H12 are mainly responsible for ER&#945; downregulation. However, in MD studies analysis, it was found that non-steroidal core molecules were less stable and showed more fluctuations (within active site) than steroidal core molecule (Fulvestrant). Moreover, protein-ligand binding energy for Fulvestrant was found to be lower which corresponds to its higher stability with ER&#945;.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: The current study helps us to understand the binding mechanism, antagonism, and downregulation of multiple SERDs, among which Fulvestrant showed the highest binding affinity towards ER&#945; (due to its highest shape similarity with E2) and can interact with and disrupt H12 (due to its long tail) which is a critical component of SERD. This knowledge could further be used to develop novel SERDs for ESR1 mutant and HR-positive breast cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71cfe68d-5b1a-491f-a590-1edde6c71ee4\/@t03B8ZAq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Molecular modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor,Breast cancer,Molecular docking,Molecular dynamics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15571"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Vishal Unadkat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shishir Rohit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Parva Purohit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chirag Mehta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vishal Goswami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahesh Barmade<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonam Sinha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ganesh Sangle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Target-based drug discovery, specifically for genetic products that cause a higher risk of disease (genetic targets), takes advantage of this fact in particular. This type of drug discovery is essential for combating various cancer protein targets, including ones responsible for multidrug- resistance in liver cancer, like YB-1.<br \/>Methods: The RCSB protein data bank (<i>PDB) <\/i>was used to retrieve the crystal structure of YB-1, while the DrugBank database was used to obtain a list of experimental and approved drugs. A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of YB-1 and Lin28, a known transcription factor, was then done by Clustal Omega to validate a conserved domain. Biovia Discovery Studio 2020 was used to visualize 3D models and perform a High-Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS), including rigid docking via the LibDock extension and flexible docking via the CDocker extension pharmacokinetic profiling via an ADMET analysis. A literature search was conducted to finalize a list of potential cancer protein inhibitors. The most promising compounds were then tested <i>in vitro<\/i> on associated liver cancer cell lines and checked for expression of YB-1 related downstream target genes (including those related to multiple-drug resistance) via real-time PCR, protein expression via western blot analysis, and YB-1 translocation via immunofluorescence.<br \/>Results: Utilizing this approach, we obtained a protein model with a 97.3 percentage in the most favorable region of a Ramachandran plot. Twenty-two drug candidates were identified through HTVS as potential inhibitors of a specific cancer protein target from a list of over 10,000 compounds in the DrugBank library.

Different p63 isoforms can have anti-tumorigenic or pro-tumorigenic activity. TA isoforms act as tumor suppressor by promoting cell death, while deltaN isoforms are strong driver for squamous\/squamous-like cancers including lung, head and neck, cervical, skin and pancreas. A large number of tumors are addicted to deltaN isoforms. Furthermore, cancer associated p53<sup>R175H<\/sup> mutant gains ability to interact with TAp63 isoforms and inhibit their anti-tumorigenic function, while indirectly promoting tumorigenic function of deltaN isoforms. However, the exact mechanism of p53<sup>R175H<\/sup>-p63 interaction is unclear. The changes in the balance of p63 isoform activity are likely to be crucial to understanding the transition between normal cell and tumor formation. Here, we modelled p53<sup>R175H<\/sup>-p63 complex using homology modelling, flexible\/unbiased docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we used our models to design peptides to disrupt p53<sup>R175H<\/sup>-p63 interaction and restore anti-tumorigenic function of TAp63 isoforms. Also, we studied deltaN isoform oligomerization and designed peptides to inhibit their oligomerization to reduce their tumorigenic activity. We showed that some of our peptides promoted cell death in a p63 enriched cancel cell line. We characterized our peptides performing kinetic binding assays to validate binding of our peptides to their designated targets. In this study, our computational and experimental analyses presented a detailed model for the p53<sup>R175H<\/sup>-p63 interaction. We also provided a framework for potential therapeutic peptides to outweigh the balance in the advantage of anti-tumorigenic p63 activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5de24094-21ba-48b7-8984-1fc7a0cd8ea3\/@t03B8ZAq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Molecular modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Apoptosis,p63,Peptides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15574"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>E.

In this study, we analyzed the association of Hippo signaling pathway genes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS) data. We used Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) AML patient data (n=16) collected from December 2015 to January 2019 for analysis. Additionally, public datasets of AML patients, TCGA-LAML (n=179) and LeuceGene (n=110) were used. we performed hierarchical clustering using Hippo pathway gene expression from AML patient samples. As a result, we discovered a gene expression signature in which the expressions of tumor suppressor genes among the Hippo pathway genes were significantly decreased. We divided AML patients into the case group and the control group according to the presence or absence of the corresponding gene expression signature and attempted to identify differences in biological features between the two groups. First, in the process of comparing differences in genetic alteration, it was confirmed that the frequency of PML-RARA fusion was significantly higher in the case group. We further analyzed the data of the AML patients in the case group without PML-RARA fusion to discover other biological features. To discover the correlation between the Hippo pathway and other oncogenic signaling pathways on gene expression level, we performed a correlation analysis. As a result, it was confirmed that the expression of the Hippo pathway gene showed a high correlation with the gene expression of the Notch signaling pathway and the Myc signaling pathway in the patients of the case group. In addition, we performed DEGs analysis to find new therapeutic target candidate genes from the case group. As a result, we identified a significantly upregulated gene, LAMP5.In conclusion, we identified the gene expression signatures of the Hippo signaling pathway in AML patients. Also, we discovered a correlation between the Hippo pathway and other signaling pathways and suggested potential therapeutic candidate genes using gene expression signatures of the Hippo signaling pathway genes. And we will perform further analysis about validating therapeutic candidate genes related to the Hippo signaling pathway gene expression signature.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0df8da89-2a2e-40cd-bbe2-43d0db05c74b\/@t03B8ZAq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Hippo pathway,Whole exome sequencing,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15651"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Heejun Jang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sungyoung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongseok Yun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongil Koh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung-Soo Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>.

According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), it was first reported in 1997 and 993 cases were reported worldwide by January 2021. Scar capsule is formed around the breast implant, and effusion exists surrounding the implant. BIA-ALCL arises either from the peri-implant capsule or seroma. We tried to understand the pathogenesis of BIA-ALCL by validating the difference in immune response according to implant texture with next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis and identifying the relevant genetic variables. Peri-implant capsule tissues were collected during the implant removal surgery and used for RNA-Seq. Breast implants were inserted for either breast reconstruction or aesthetic purposes. Implant types were grouped following the surface texturing; macrotextured, microtexturedm and smooth. Three macrotextured, four microtextured, and three smooth type samples were used in this study. After aligning the data to the GRCh38 genomic reference with a STAR aligner, the expression level was quantified using RSEM. Differentially expressed gene analysis was performed between groups using DESeq2 based on the obtained TPM values. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and enrichR were performed to obtain enriched pathways. In addition, the proportion of the cell type of the dataset was calculated using CIBERSORTx.DEG analysis identified a total of 185 up-regulated genes and 81 down-regulated genes between groups (Fold change &#62; 2, fold change &#60; 0.5, Q-value &#60;= 0.05). As a result of pathway enrichment analysis using enrichR for up-regulated genes, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) signaling pathway was significantly enriched in microtextured type and smooth type compared to macrotextured type. There are three subtypes of PPAR, of which PPAR&#947; inhibits the JAK-STAT pathway and is known to increase the suppressor of cytokine signaling. In this regard, it is expected that the macrotextured implant group, in which the PPAR signaling pathway is not enriched compared to other groups, may have affected the function of T helper cells due to dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway. It has been demonstrated at the whole exome level that mutations in JAK1 and STAT3 are associated with the pathogenesis of BIA-ALCL. As a result of CIBERSORTx analysis, the ratio of fibroblast in the Smooth type was small and the T cell distribution was relatively high. Identifying the various factors involved in these PPAR&#947; related pathways and the correlation between them will lead to the development of the prognosis of breast reconstruction and the diagnosis and treatment of BIA-ALCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed678c24-f7f7-47e3-8120-a46102e1be94\/@t03B8ZAq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,BIA-ALCL,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15652"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanyeowool An<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong Hyun Ha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngil Koh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ung Sik Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung-Soo Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>.

To address this, we herein downloaded RNAseq gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) UCEC (uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma) dataset and matched it with clinical data entries including patient height and weight. We calculated BMI for each patient and used it to stratify patients as normoweight (BMI &#60; 25), overweight (25 &#8804; BMI &#60; 30) or obese (BMI &#8805; 30). BMI and nutritional status were matched to RNAseq gene expression data. Considering the known differences between endometrioid and serous uterine corpus tumors, analyses were performed separately for endometrioid (n = 356) and serous carcinomas (n = 117). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed between normoweight, overweight and obese patients. GSEA shows that tumors from obese patients display multiple dysregulated Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Biological Process, BP), which also differ between serous and endometrioid tumors. We further explored the impact of obesity on transcriptomic profiles of serous and endometrioid carcinomas by nutritional status independently by differential expression analysis using limma-voom. Significantly up- or downregulated genes were defined as those with logFC &#8805; 1.5 at a non-adjusted P-value &#8804; 0.01. Despite a clear enrichment or suppression of GO terms as evidenced by GSEA, transcriptomic analyses did not clearly separate patients according to their nutritional status. Therefore, obesity may impact on the dysregulation of biological processes through the cumulative effects of subtle differences in gene expression that, individually, do not seem to play a major role in oncogenesis. These results spotlight the relevance of obesity on the biology of uterine corpus cancers, which impact on the clinical course and treatment response of obese patients is yet to be determined.

Response differs according to tumor heterogeneity, notably through clonal selection according to genetic background. We developed an in silico EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinoma (EGFR+ LUAD) model topredict the effect of EGFR mutations on tumor size in advanced LUAD patients using a mechanistic representation of tumor progression, including response to gefitinib. Tumor heterogeneity, age, gender, initial clinical stage, and smoking status are included as covariates.<br \/>Methods: 5-step in silico model development: (i) Model Building: Biology of EGFR+LUAD was characterized by extracting biological features and their functional relationships from literature and translating them into ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Mutational burden, EGFR downstream-pathways, tumor growth and heterogeneity, gefitinib-PK\/PD, treatment-induced resistance and clinical outcome were modeled in a computational simulation with 43 variables, 170 parameters and 18 to 83 ODEs reflecting intra-tumor heterogeneity. (ii) Calibration: Published spheroid, xenograft and clinical data were used for stepwise calibration. (iii) Virtual populations (VPOP): VPOPs were generated for validation and benchmarking respectively, adapting baseline characteristics of a real population.(iv) Validation: A VPOP with comparable baseline characteristics was tested against published patient data.(v) Benchmarking against a Bayesian reference model : (1) coverage of experimental interquartile range (IQR) with simulated IQR (precision) assesses model fit with experimental data, (2) coverage of simulated IQR with experimental IQR (overlap) assesses model fit with experimental variability.<br \/>Results: Our model computed in silico data comparable to the reference model without use of original data for calibration (Figure 1B.2: experimental vs. simulated, precision of 68%, overlap of 91%). The reference model reported precision of 72% and overlap of 86%. Therefore, the ISELA model has a better percentage of the literature data area contained in the simulated one while the Bayesian model presents a better percentage of the simulated data contained in the literature one.<br \/>Conclusion: We simulated tumor growth and treatment response in advanced EGFR+ LUAD patients and successfully validated results with published data, and compared it to an already published model with the same context of use. Both models successfully provide a reliable description of longitudinal tumor size when compared to each other or to observed data. Our model provides a benchmark for future in silico clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d7314c3-b803-4b07-a0be-68b28718bb7c\/@t03B8ZAq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,EGFR,Modeling,Tumor growth,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15659"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Duruisseaux<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adèle L'Hostis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emmanuel Peyronnet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evgueni Jacob<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ben M.W.

Positive margins mandate re-excision, and some patients may require multiple resections and mastectomy to obtain negative margins. In this study, association of various clinicopathologic factors with positive surgical margins for primary invasive breast cancer was assessed using both public and in-house datasets.<br \/><b>Method<\/b>: The datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas-Breast Cancer (TCGA-BC) and Clinical Breast Care Project (CBCP). The proportion of positive to negative margins in both TCGA-BC (3.86 %, 38\/984) and CBCP (3.78%, 15\/397) was similar. The role of each clinicopathologic factor for margin prediction was evaluated using logistic regression, Fisher&#8217;s exact test and Cox proportional hazards models.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The univariable and multivariable logistic regression using both TCGA-BC and CBCP data sets showed that higher tumor stage, tumor size and positive lymph nodes significantly contributed (p &#60; 0.05) to positive surgical margins. In agreement with the results of logistic regression, Fisher&#8217;s exact test also showed the association of tumor stage with margin status. Furthermore, PAM50 subtype normal-like was significantly associated (p = 0.044) with positive margins while Her2 subtype was close to significance (p= 0.062) in TCGA-BC. However, they were not significant in the multivariable model. In addition, young patients also showed close significance to positive margins (p = 0.054) in the multivariable model. The bivariable cox hazards model demonstrated that margin status along with PAM50 subtype significantly associated with progression of the disease in TCGA-BC. On the other hand, margin status along with stage or TNM (T:Tumor size, N: Lymph Node Status, M: Metastasis) was insignificant. This shows that margin status was surrogate to tumor stage or TNM.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: This characterization study showed that chances of obtaining positive margins increases with higher tumor stage, tumor size and positive lymph nodes. Subtype and age also trended to affect margin status. If validated in a dataset of a larger number of cases with positive margin, our results may provide an additional perspective of how the margin status is associated with the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients which may further impact care provider&#8217;s decision making for re-excisions.<br \/><b>Disclaimer<\/b>: The contents of this publication are the sole responsibility of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions or policies of USUHS, HJF, the DoD or the Departments of the Army, Navy or Air Force.

LFS is estimated to occur in 1:1000 - 1:5000 people and is associated with a 80% lifetime cancer risk. This syndrome is diagnosed using familial cancer history and germline <i>TP53<\/i> sequencing; however, clinical heterogeneity and variants of unknown significance limit diagnostic precision. Accurate diagnosis is imperative to implement surveillance for secondary malignancies and familial genetic testing.<br \/>Methods: We hypothesized that LFS cancers evolve uniquely from sporadic cancers, implying that the somatic genomes of LFS patients exhibit distinct characteristics that can infer the predisposition syndrome. To investigate this, we interrogated mutational signatures, <i>TP53<\/i> copy number, <i>TP53<\/i> loss of heterozygosity, ploidy, and the incidence of chromothripsis in tumor compared to normal samples (blood or fibroblast) of individuals with germline <i>TP53<\/i> mutations (n=27), somatic <i>TP53<\/i> mutations (n=17) and WT for <i>TP53<\/i> (n=158). We created a random forest model with 10-fold cross validation to determine if somatic features could diagnose LFS.<br \/>Results: No signatures were significantly associated with LFS (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Benjamin-Hochberg FDR correction). As previously reported in the literature, LFS compared to non-LFS cancers in our cohort were more likely to: be hyperdiploid (odds ratio (OR) = 11.83, FDR &#60; 0.0001, Fisher exact test), have undergone TP53 loss of heterozygosity (OR = 23.15, FDR &#60; 0.0001, Fisher exact test) and experience chromothripsis (OR = 7.76, FDR &#60; 0.001, Fisher exact test).<br \/>The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for our random forest model with 10-fold cross validation was 0.90, the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) was 0.59, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.70, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.93 and the F1-score was 0.52. This implies that the somatic genomic features are reliable indicators of this germline syndrome. We have obtained access to a future 50 LFS samples from the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project dataset, which we hope will improve our model&#8217;s performance.<br \/>Conclusion: We have developed a machine learning tool that uses somatic features to identify LFS, a germline cancer predisposition syndrome. As the importance of precision oncology becomes apparent, a tool to identify LFS patients from the somatic genome will facilitate early diagnosis. This will allow individuals to enter a surveillance program for early detection of secondary tumors, leading to improved outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6f0dee1a-11f6-4a70-ae67-898c7606b6d1\/@t03B8ZAq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Somatic mutations,Bioinformatics,Machine learning,Li-Fraumeni Syndrome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15663"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"ff9627a7-3d9d-410f-9509-d6a4c5bdf086","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ff9627a7-3d9d-410f-9509-d6a4c5bdf086\/@t03B8ZAq\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brianne Laverty<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vallijah Subasri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Light<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Malkin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Targeted MAPK pathway inhibitors have been approved as therapies in patient populations with genomic alterations to MAPK pathway genes (e.g. dabrafenib in BRAF-mutant melanoma), with multiple other MAPK-targeted therapies in development. We have previously demonstrated that cell lines with MAPK pathway genomic alterations show increased sensitivity to ASTX029, our potent and selective dual-mechanism ERK inhibitor which is currently undergoing clinical development. However, MAPK oncogene status alone is not a universal indicator of sensitivity, nor is it clear that genomic markers of sensitivity to single agent inhibition represent the optimal approach to predicting response to MAPK targeted agents in the combination setting (e.g. sotorasib + trametinib). We therefore analysed MAPK pathway related transcriptional signatures to assess predictability for response to ASTX029 in combination with a SHP2 inhibitor.<br \/>We previously presented data from large-scale viability screens assessing the response to ASTX029 as a single agent treatment (437 cell lines), as well as in combination with an inhibitor of SHP2 (491 cell lines), an upstream adaptor protein in the MAPK pathway. Using these data, several published transcriptional signatures related to the MAPK pathway were assessed for their ability to stratify sensitive vs resistant cell lines when benchmarked against MAPK oncogene genomic status alone.<br \/>All assessed transcriptomics-based scores had a significant positive correlation with growth inhibition for ERK inhibitor single agent treatment as well as in combination with a SHP2 inhibitor. Transcriptomics-based scores were shown to be more sensitive than the use of mutant MAPK oncogene status alone based on assessment of binomial regression models. The significant increase in sensitivity enables the identification of additional cell lines responsive to MAPK pathway inhibition. The sensitivity was further increased when considering response to the combination of an ERK and SHP2 inhibitor compared to the ERK inhibitor as a single agent.<br \/>This analysis demonstrates the potential use of MAPK pathway-related transcriptomics-based scores for the stratification of MAPK pathway inhibitor response. ASTX029 is currently undergoing clinical development in advanced solid tumours (NCT03520075) and transcriptomics-based methods may provide utility in refining patient selection in the clinic for single agent or combination approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c44cb40-488e-4443-a38d-808a3d8b07dd\/@u03B8ZAr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,Gene expression,Drug sensitivity,MAPK combination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15730"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jessica Brothwood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Biondo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim-Hien Dao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keisha Hearn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Hindley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Navrohit Kandola<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harold Keer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Lyons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoko Nakatsuru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc O'Reilly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicola Wallis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Harpreet Saini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Oncolytic viruses emerge as a new modality in cancer therapy due to their natural ability to infect and kill cancer cells, and to stimulate patient's own immune system to eliminate cancer cells throughout the body. For this study, we used novel engineered oncolytic adenovirus, Ad5\/35-3M (AVID-317), which demonstrated greatly-improved safety profile after systemic virus administration due to a set of targeted mutations in the adenovirus capsid (Atasheva et al, Science Translational Medicine, 2020, eabc6659). Systemic administration of AVID-317 to NCr\/Nude mice with disseminated lung adenocarcinoma slowed tumor progression and significantly extended survival, compared to buffer-treated control tumor-bearing mice. In AVID-317 treated group, about 25% of mice demonstrated complete rejection of disseminated tumors and the rest of mice showed significantly extended survival. To understand the mechanism of AVID-317-mediated tumor suppression and to design more effective combination therapies, we analyzed disseminated tumors from the lungs in NCr\/Nude mice using single cell RNA-seq and Mass Cytometry (Cy-TOF) after virotherapy. Our scRNA-seq analysis showed that in a subset of mice responding poorly to AVID-317 therapy, tumor-associated CSF1R-expressing myeloid cells expressed higher levels of MHC-II, Ctsb, and Arg1. In addition, CD3e<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressed functional exhaustion marker, PD-1, exclusively in mice that responded poorly to virotherapy. Mass Cytometry analysis with 37 metal isotope-labeled antibodies confirmed elevated expression of activation markers on myeloid cells after virotherapy. Next, we analyzed the efficacy of a combination therapy where in addition to AVID-317 administration, tumor-bearing mice were treated with anti PD-1 antibody to block immune-suppressive signaling in T cells, anti-CSF1R antibody to block CSF1R signaling, and anti-Asialo GM1 antibody to deplete anti-viral NK cells. Our analyses showed that combination therapy regimen significantly improved therapeutic outcomes in mice with disseminated lung cancer, by extending median survival to 95 days from 55-56 days observed in mice treated with either virus alone or combination drugs without the virus. Taken together, our study demonstrated feasibility of using AVID-317 oncolytic adenovirus for systemic therapy of disseminated lung cancer.

In the presented study, we performed a whole transcriptome analysis of 18 fresh frozen colorectal adenomas and their adjacent mucosa from the Czech and Italian populations. Samples were matched for histology and sex. The libraries were sequenced through NovaSeq6000 with a paired-end approach (2 &#215; 150 bp) and with 100 million reads per sample. The enrichment analysis showed that the most downregulated pathways belonged to immune responses and complement activation while the most upregulated pathways were enriched predominantly in proliferation and development-related Gene Ontology biological processes. In total 2,753 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) coherent between these two populations were identified. To determinate, the subset of discriminant DEGs for colorectal adenomas, the output of seven feature selection methods was combined highlighting a total of 321 DEGs scored at the top 95% of at least one method. Further from this set, 8 candidate genes <i>AXIN2, ETV4, RNF43, CXCL12, FBLN1, GNG7, ZEB2,<\/i> and <i>SFRP1<\/i> were selected for validation on a larger population as well as for functional <i>in vitro <\/i>assays. The results will be presented at the annual meeting. We believe that the study could provide new candidate biomarkers for precancerous colorectal cancer stages.

Overactivation of the ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K pathways is commonly seen in cancer and is associated with poor patient prognosis. Increasing evidence is showcasing that epigenetic alterations play a major role in regulating the ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K pathways.<br \/>Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is an epigenetic regulator currently undergoing clinical trials as a potential therapeutic target for cancer. PRMT5 has been shown to be overexpressed and negatively correlated with patient survival in many types of cancers. Recent studies are indicating that PRMT5 is involved in regulating the ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K pathways. Moreover, our group's work, as well as other studies, are demonstrating that PRMT5 inhibition, as well as PRMT5 and ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K combination therapies, show significant therapeutic effects in many types of cancers.<br \/>In this study, the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database was used to analyze the RNA-Seq data of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We first used the GEPIA database to determine which proteins in the ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K pathways are expressionally correlated with PRMT5 in colon and rectum patient tumor samples. We found that the receptor proteins EGFR and FGFR3 were positively correlated with PRMT5 with a R-Value &#62; 0.61 and a P-Value &#60; 0.01. We further determined that the ERK1\/2 pathway proteins KRAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK were all positively correlated with PRMT5 with a R-Value &#62; 0.73 and a P-Value &#60; 0.01. Lastly, we found that the PI3K pathway proteins PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and PTEN were positively correlated with PRMT5 with a R-Value &#62; 0.71 and a P-Value &#60; 0.01.<br \/>We next used the STRING database to analyze and determine which proteins in the ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K pathways interact with PRMT5. We found that PRMT5 interacts with the receptor proteins EGFR and FGFR3, the ERK1\/2 pathway proteins KRAS, and lastly, the PI3K pathway proteins AKT, mTOR, and PTEN with an interaction score &#62; 0.150. Finally, we then used Biorender to develop a protein network map to model the proteins in the ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K pathways that both positively correlate with, as well as interact with, PRMT5. Our protein network map demonstrates that PRMT5 is positively correlated with (R-Value &#62; 0.61, P-Value &#60; 0.01), as well as interacts<b> <\/b>with (interaction score &#62; 0.150) the following ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K pathway proteins: EGFR, FGFR3, KRAS, AKT, mTOR, and PTEN.<br \/>Our study thus shows further evidence that PRMT5 is positively correlated with, as well as interacts<b> <\/b>with, the ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K pathways in CRC. These findings are significant as they make the case for additional testing of PRMT5 inhibition, as well as PRMT5 and ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K combination therapies, for the treatment of cancer. Further analysis is currently in progress to delineate the molecular mechanisms behind PRMT5&#8217;s interactions with the ERK1\/2 &#38; PI3K pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c9d250bb-b810-43d2-a308-f53c9b544bc9\/@u03B8ZAr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,ERK,PRMT5,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15896"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Shifteh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tzuriel Sapir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moshe Pahmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjay Goel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Radhashree Maitra<\/i><\/presenter>.

Fatty acid desaturase1 (FADS1) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA metabolism. We aim to investigate the association between FADS1 and survival outcomes among cancer patients. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were performed for FADS1 mRNA expression levels on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public datasets. We also investigated the pathways associated with altered FADS1 expression in the TCGA dataset. A FADS1 inhibitor (D5D-IN-326) was used to study the proliferation <i>in vitro <\/i>in 6 different cancer cell lines<i>. <\/i>FADS1-shRNA knockdown system was introduced in the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 786-O cell line to further study the signaling pathway associated with proliferation. Transcriptomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic profiles of stable cell lines were studied. Our analysis showed that among all cancer patients (N=11,490), those with a higher FADS1 mRNA expression in their tumor have a significantly worse DFS and OS (p.value &#60;0.001 and 0.01, respectively). This association was particularly significant in RCC subtypes. Pathway analysis demonstrated that cell cycle and DNA replication were significantly enriched as the top pathways associated with FADS1 expression. Administration of FADS1 inhibitor compound 326 decreased cell proliferation in cell lines of several major cancers in a dose-dependent manner. The proliferation result was confirmed in RCC FADS1 knockdown model. RNA-seq analysis of FADS1 knockdown stable cells also showed downregulation of DNA biosynthesis, cell division, and cell proliferation. In our metabolomic study, 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) was significantly reduced in FADS1 knockdown (KD) cells which may be attributed to altered purine metabolism (p-value &#60; 0.001). As we expected, the total omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids were lower in KD cells. We further identified lower P38 phosphorylation in KD cells which is consistent with lower cell proliferation. These results suggest that FADS1 overexpression is prognostic to lower survival in cancer patients via changing cancer metabolism, which is potentially mediated via altering cell proliferation through MAPK pathway. This study has a potential to discover a new mechanism of cancer biology and develop a novel precision treatment for cancer patients. The detailed causal relationship is warranted for continued investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fe60bf99-a0e1-4a4a-9c93-37d1d79fffd4\/@u03B8ZAr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fatty acids,FADS1,Survival,Renal cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15897"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gioia Heravi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyejeong Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seongho Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wanqing Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

It relies on high-quality RNA in order to yield reliable and reproducible results, which is often challenging due to RNA degradation during sample collection and processing. Agilent&#8217;s RNA Integrity Number (RIN) is a commonly adopted standard for evaluating RNA quality in NGS workflows. However, while most RNA-Seq experiments are geared towards the quantification of mRNA, the RIN metric heavily relies on the amount of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA and does not directly measure the integrity of mRNA. To overcome this limitation, researchers have proposed several post-alignment measures of transcript integrity, such as mRIN (mRNA Integrity Number), TIN (Transcript Integrity Number, from RSeQC package), and DI (Degradation Index, from DegNorm package), but so far there is no consensus as to which works best. It is also unclear to what extent RNA degradation impacts the results of downstream analysis when samples with suboptimal RNA quality are included.<br \/>To answer these questions in the context of cancer research, we analyzed 198 RNA-Seq samples from 7 syngeneic mouse tumor models of different cancer types (4T1, CT26, EL4, E.G7-OVA, H22, Hepa1-6, and KLN205) with a wide range of RIN values (2.3 to 9.8). Interestingly, we found a high concordance between RIN and medTIN (median TIN score) in 4T1, E.G7-OVA, Hepa1-6, and KLN205 samples, but a surprisingly low concordance in EL4 and H22 samples. A tentative interpretation is that, depending on the tissue\/cell type, it is possible for an RNA sample to have heavily degraded ribosomal RNA (hence a low RIN value), while still retaining relatively intact mRNA (resulting in a decent medTIN value). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that both RIN and medTIN are strongly correlated with the strongest explanatory variable (PC1) of the transcriptome across all library types, confirming that RNA degradation can heavily bias the results of transcript-level DE (differential expression) analysis. We then evaluated the performance of TIN correction, a method proposed in conjunction with the TIN metric to correct for RNA-degradation bias, and found it to be largely ineffective on our dataset. Apparently, there is a need for better normalization\/correction methods when a dataset consists of samples with wildly varying RNA quality. On the other hand, the impact of RNA degradation on gene-level DE analysis is much smaller. In PCA on gene-level data, the first 4 PCs, which altogether explain &#62; 70% of the variation in the transcriptome, showed weak or no correlation with RIN or medTIN, and the samples cluster according to their respective tissue groups as expected. Our study calls for cautious analysis and interpretation of gene expression data from degraded RNA samples, and highlights a need for more suitable RNA quality metrics and bias correction methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/482440e7-3ada-4a70-8eb9-243b1f2d6442\/@u03B8ZAr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-01 Analytic pipeline optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing,Syngeneic models,Differential gene expression,RNA degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19395"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanghui Sheng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wubin Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaobo Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henry Q.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed (excluding skin cancers) among women in the United States, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers. Thus, the need for effective targets and biomarkers to prevent\/treat this disease.<br \/>Available datasets to study gene expression in human diseases are a valuable asset to better understand complex disorders and phenotypes. In this study, we are using three publicly available datasets: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) to study breast cancer and identify coding and lncRNA transcripts differentially expressed in tumors and highly specific to testis. At the end of our analysis pipeline, we identified a total of 1,668 upregulated genes in breast cancer and 1,163 downregulated genes in breast cancer, from which a total of 31 were lncRNAs. Characterization of the lncRNAs show highly specificity in diverse types of breast cancer (Basal, Luminal A, Luminal B and HER2) compared to protein coding genes. Cell line analysis of breast cancer RNA-Seq samples by the CCLE- Broad Institute show clustering of gene expression for the identified lncRNAs according to molecular subtype. Moreover, categorization of the lncRNAs using TCGA is described by ER- and ER+ status, molecular subtype, comparison between breast tumor, breast normal and GTEx breast, and gene ontology analysis of KEGG Pathways using DAVID. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis is shown to estimate the potential survival outcome of patients with high\/low expression of lncRNAs in breast cancer. Lastly, we compared results from qRT-PCR with our in-silico data for the top lncRNAs and findings show a good correlation between both platforms.<br \/>Overall, we identify a total of 31 lncRNAs that are estrogen-regulated testis specific in breast cancer by differential expression analysis. In addition, we provide a full genomic characterization of the lncRNAs that show expression according to different molecular subtypes using data from TCGA, GTEx and CCLE. Finally, we show potential survival outcome of high\/low expression of identified lncRNAs in breast cancer patients. Taken together, we present lncRNAs specific in breast cancer and high expression in testis, along with their comprehensive characterization of expression signatures. Further studies, are needed to assess their efficacy as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in breast cancer.<br \/>S.S.G. is supported by a grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT; RR170020).
