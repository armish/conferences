Although Hanahan and Weinberg highlighted the role of the tumor microenvironment, the existing hallmarks should be expanded to include another crucial aspect of the tumor microenvironment&#8212;the tumor-neural interaction. Traditionally, the nervous and immune systems have been viewed as functionally and anatomically distinct, even though they share a critical common task: to detect and respond to internal and external threats, whether physical, chemical, or biological. While the role of the immune system is well established in cancer, and both immune evasion and tumor-promoting inflammation are considered hallmarks of cancer, the nervous system is typically viewed as a tissue <i>affected<\/i> by cancer and as a conduit for the transmission of cancer-related pain and perineural invasion.<br \/>Recent work by us and others has shown that the nervous system plays several important roles in promoting tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. By comparing the transcriptomes of cancer-associated trigeminal sensory neurons with those of endogenous neurons in mouse models of oral cancer, we identified an adrenergic differentiation signature. We showed that loss of TP53 leads to adrenergic transdifferentiation of tumour-associated sensory nerves through loss of the microRNA miR-34a. Tumor growth was inhibited by sensory denervation or pharmacological blockade of adrenergic receptors, but not by chemical sympathectomy of pre-existing adrenergic nerves. A retrospective analysis of samples from oral cancer revealed that p53 status was associated with nerve density, which was in turn associated with poor clinical outcomes. This crosstalk between cancer cells and neurons represents one mechanism by which tumor-associated neurons are reprogrammed towards an adrenergic phenotype that can stimulate tumor progression and is a potential target for anticancer therapy. These studies suggest that newly formed nerve fibers support both cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, despite increasing recognition of tumor-associated neurogenesis&#8212;the formation of new nerve fibers&#8212;this topic has been relatively understudied.<br \/>In the last decade, emerging technologies have enabled us to bridge the gaps between cancer research and neuroscience and to take a glimpse into the roles of nerves and their supporting cells like Schwann cells, in cancer. Specifically, the development of spatial imaging and <i>in vivo<\/i> neural tracing and recording techniques removed some of the obstacles that impeded cancer neuroscience research, namely, our ability to capture phenotypes and functions in the tumor microenvironment (i.e., dendrites and axons, far away from the neuron cell body or soma) using high-dimensional labeling techniques (e.g., mass cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence). Using these techniques, it has been shown that in many types of cancer, ablation of different portions of the nervous system prevents cancer development and progression. This process is similar to another microenvironmental hallmark of cancer&#8212;tumor angiogenesis, whereby tumors induce the growth of new blood vessels to supply them with oxygen and blood-borne nutrients. Importantly, neuromodulation with both genetic and pharmacologic approaches has been shown to affect not only tumor growth but also the antitumor immune response.<br \/>Neurogenesis should be recognized as a hallmark of cancer for two important reasons. First, doing so would establish the neo-neurogenic process as a highly relevant therapeutic target for both the prevention and treatment of cancer. Second, it would foster interdisciplinary crosstalk between two fields that traditionally have progressed along parallel paths. We have credentialed the neoneurogenic process as a highly relevant therapeutic target for both the prevention and treatment of cancer; hopefully, in the next decade we will see more clinical trials targeting the neural microenvironment of cancer aiming to prevent tumor&#8217;s development and progression and improve patient&#8217;s quality of life.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Head and neck cancers,p53,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Moran Amit<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Given that resistance to cytotoxic therapy is pervasive, there is a critical need to elucidate salient gene expression programs and spatial relationships among malignant and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly in residual disease. We developed and applied a single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) technique to 43 banked frozen primary PDAC specimens that either received neoadjuvant therapy (n=25) or were treatment-na&#239;ve (n=18). We discovered expression programs across malignant cell and fibroblast profiles that formed the basis for a refined molecular taxonomy, including a novel neural-like progenitor (NRP) malignant program enriched with neoadjuvant treatment in tumors and organoids, and associated with the worst prognosis in bulk profiles from independent cohorts.<br \/>To elucidate how neoadjuvant treatment and cancer cell- and fibroblast-intrinsic programs modulate the composition of multicellular neighborhoods, we performed spatial profiling with the GeoMx[1] platform (NanoString) on 21 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections using the human whole transcriptome atlas (WTA). Each tumor showed intra-tumoral heterogeneity in tissue architecture and regions of interest (ROIs) with diverse patterns of neoplastic cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and immune cells were selected for profiling. We deconvolved the WTA data with our snRNA-seq cell type signatures and mapped expression programs onto the tumor architecture to reveal three distinct multicellular neighborhoods, which we annotated as classical, squamoid-basaloid, and treatment-enriched. The observed enrichment in post-treatment residual disease of multiple spatially-defined receptor-ligand interactions and a neighborhood featuring the NRP program, neurotropic CAF program, and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells may open new therapeutic opportunities.<br \/>Next, we mapped malignant\/CAF programs and immune cell subsets at single-cell spatial resolution by performing spatial molecular imaging (SMI[2]; NanoString CosMx) using a panel of 960 RNA targets on a subset of seven tumors (2 untreated, 5 treated) and captured over 200,000 cells with an average of more than 450 transcripts detected per cell. Correlating ROIs from whole-transcriptome DSP to matched fields of view in kiloplex SMI enabled further dissection of PDAC architecture and treatment-associated remodeling of cell type distributions and receptor-ligand interactions.<br \/>Ongoing functional studies have begun to elucidate the key regulatory elements underlying the distinct treatment-associated NRP malignant program and its interactions with the TME. Overall, the complementary combination of snRNA-seq, whole-transcriptome DSP, and kiloplex SMI provides a high-resolution molecular framework that can be harnessed to augment precision oncology efforts in pancreatic cancer.<br \/><i><b>[1]<\/b><\/i><i> GeoMx DSP is for Research Use Only and not for use in diagnostic procedures.<\/i> <i><b>[2]<\/b><\/i><i> CosMx SMI is for Research Use Only and not for use in diagnostic procedures.<\/i><i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Therapy resistance,Pancreatic cancer,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William L.
