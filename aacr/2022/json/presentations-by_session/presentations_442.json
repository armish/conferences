[{"Abstract":"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) significantly increases the risk for development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the exact molecular mechanisms that underlie the transition from inflammation to cancer are not fully understood, and a systematic characterization of the immunopathogenesis of IBD-associated CRC is lacking. To address this issue, we will perform a comprehensive and spatial tissue analysis using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas (CTA) on the NanoString GeoMx<sup>&#174;<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP). The CTA panel is designed to profile the global immune response and all aspects of tumor microenvironment biology, including the 18-gene Tumor Inflammation Signature (TIS).<br \/>For DSP analysis, a total of 20 FFPE samples (5 colon cancer patients, 5 UC patients, 5 CD patients, and 5 matched normal samples will be spatially profiled for up to 1,800 genes included on the CTA. Selection of regions of interest (ROI) will be guided by H&#38;E staining and fluorescent markers (CD45, PanCK, Syto13), and profiling of tumor and TME regions will be achieved through segmenting by PanCK+\/PanCK- followed by collection of indexed oligonucleotides and sequenced on NextSeq 550 Illumina instrument. NGS reads will be processed into digital counts, normalized and mapped back to each ROI, generating a map of transcript activity within each ROI. For all samples crypt and villus regions will be selected for a detailed spatial analysis. Subsequently, using the proprietary multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) platform MultiOmyx&#8482; we will characterize the protein immune cell landscape in IBD-associated CRC, using a custom immune panel applied to adjacent slides.<br \/>With this study we hope to highlight genes and pathways involved in the transition from inflammation to cancer by combining large-scale spatial gene profiling by DSP CTA with a comprehensive spatial protein profiling by MultiOmyx. It is our hope that this will provide some much-needed understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading from an IBD disorder to the development of colon cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f48ae544-a03c-4777-9591-e6685afe26b4\/@F03B8ZL6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Microenvironment,Colorectal cancer,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11476"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Juncker-Jensen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lakshmi Chandramohan<\/i><\/presenter>.

In contrast, only little is known about the existence, stability, functions and prognostic potential of different plastic phenotypes of tumor vessel endothelial cells (TECs) in cancer. Recently, transcriptional memory effects have been observed in different cell lines after cytokine stimulation in vitro. From this we developed the hypothesis that isolated TEC may exhibit TME-dependent transcriptional memories, which may provide novel insights into the intratumoral effects on TEC plasticity in cancer. To investigate this, we isolated ultrapure TECs from colorectal cancer (CRC) with prognostically favorable (Th-1-like) or worse (non-Th1-like) immune-micro-environments and analyzed the prescence of TME-associated transcriptional memory patterns.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> TECs and as controls normal colon endothelial cells (NECs), PBMCs and tumor cells (isolated by laser-microdissection) from the same CRC patients (n=75) were isolated by FACS-sorting. Ultra high purity (98%) of TECs and NECs was validated by qPCR and immunocytochemistry. Quality validated complete sample sets from 12 patients (Th-1-like, n=6, non-Th1-like, n=6) were compared using exome sequencing, Clariome S chips and EPICmethylation. Integrative bioinformatics was used to identify differential gene sets and to predict their association with prognosis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Differential transcriptional memory patterns were detected in TECs derived from CRC with different prognostic TMEs. Of note, the aggressiveness of the originating tumors was reflected by the functions of the vascular transcriptional memory genes. The transcriptional memory was imprinted by epigenetic DNA methylation and not due to acquired somatic variants in the genome. These results could be successfully confirmed by alternative methods. Most importantly, integrative bioinformatics analyses retrieved seven vascular memory genes (VMG), which were expressed in the TECs in a TME-dependent manner and predicted the outcome of patients in an independent cohort of CRC patients.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our findings demonstrate for the first time a TME-dependent transcriptional memory of TECs, providing a clinically relevant indicator of intra-tumoral TME-dependent vascular plasticity with perspectives for patient stratification in vessel-directed tumor therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b9bd88db-343a-4dbe-9017-d045883854e0\/@F03B8ZL6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endothelial cells,Transcriptional memory,Microenvironment,Tumor neovasculature,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11478"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Stürzl<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maximilian Fuchs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meik Kunz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Dickel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernt Popp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steffen Uebe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arif B.

We previously demonstrated a strong correlation between elevated NOS2 and COX2 expressions suggesting these genes can serve as markers of poor prognosis in estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer. In other words, NOS2 and COX2 is generally associated with the immune response. Induction of NOS2 and COX2 has also been shown to orchestrate multiple pro-oncogenic pathways that may contribute to the immunosuppressive nature of cancer cells. To better understand the interactions between cytokines and breast cancer cells and develop effective therapeutics for breast cancer, we examined the effects of selected cytokines on MDA-MB-231, a human (ER-) breast adenocarcinoma cell line. We found that in combination with cytokines, such as IFNG plus TNF, IL1B, or IL17, significantly induced NOS2 and COX2. IFNG plus TNF or IL1B most strongly induced NOS2 and COX2 where IFNG or IL17 to a lesser extent. It indicates that expressions of NOS2 and COX2 required IFNG but at a low dose in presence of other cytokines. Single-cell RNAseq analysis shows that cells treated with IFNG plus TNF or IL1B clustered with those expressed NOS2 and COX2 as revealed in tSNE plots. Expression of other factors such as IL8 and IL6 (suggested markers for prognosis of breast cancer) or PDL1 and IDO1 (suggested cancer therapeutic targets) also co-clustered with NOS2 and COX2 expressions. In addition, we found increased IL1A and IL1B expressions provide fortification to NOS2 and COX2 expressions. Taken together, our current findings indicate the interactions between breast cancer cells and cytokines. We believe further spatial transcriptomic and proteomic studies may be beneficial for clarifying the complex networks of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/133115bc-d6d7-48ae-8269-0600035c04f2\/@F03B8ZL6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,iNOS,COX-2,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11481"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuk Sing Robert Cheng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Ridnour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veena Somasundaram<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dana Bhattacharyya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher McGinity<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel McVicar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Lockett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Wink<\/i><\/presenter>.

This incidence is also reflected among active-duty service members, and patient biospecimens obtained from an equal access healthcare setting at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center provide a valuable resource for the evaluation of cancer health disparities. The objectives of this study are to identify immunobiological differences influencing prostate cancer disparities and to elucidate the immune cell profiles of patient tumors associated with advanced disease.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Patients provided written consent to both biospecimen and clinical database collection under IRB-approved protocols. Fresh frozen tumor biopsy tissues were collected <i>ex vivo<\/i>, following radical prostatectomy. Total tumor RNA was amplified by PCR-based multiplexed target enrichment, and barcode-tagged transcripts were quantified using NanoString technology. Raw and relative abundances of immune cells were determined using published deconvolution algorithms. Differential expression of immune-related genes and cell type contrasts were evaluated for correlation with clinico-pathologic features.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Genes regulating metabolism and innate immune responses were differentially expressed between AA and CA prostate tumors (AA n=26, CA n=25). Comparing high vs. low expression of each of these top genes, two were associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. Most immune cell subtypes did not differ significantly between AA and CA, but mast cells appeared to be enriched within AA tumors. When cell types were stratified by clinical and pathologic variables, we identified consistent trends in immune cell content that changed with increasing diagnostic age, PSA group, Grade Group, Gleason Sum, and with disease progression as defined by future development of BCR and\/or metastasis.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Attention should be directed toward observed immunobiological differences based on race and other clinico-pathologic factors at the time of radical prostatectomy.

Standard multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) or multiplex immuno-fluorescent assays (mIF) allow for the phenotyping on the cellular level but are limited by the number of markers available and the detection systems. Gene expression or next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms provide high-plex bulk data sets about the TME, but the spatial context of the tumor and immune cell interactions is lost. The NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) combines spatial context, utilizing fluorescent morphological markers, with molecular profiling capabilities. This combination allows for the quantitative analysis of high-plex analyte abundance which can be traced back to a region of interest within a sample, providing biological inference in the region of interest.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens from HNSCC patients were cut in 5&#181;m sections for all analyses.

Both pressurized and hypoxic culture conditions can influence gene and protein expression of tumor cells which can result in tumor metastasis and drug resistance. Enzalutamide is effective in treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but majority of patients eventually develop resistance to enzalutamide. One of the biomarkers of enzalutamide resistance is the expression of androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7), but the mechanism of how AR-V7 expression is upregulated in prostate cancer is unclear. To investigate the influence of TME culture conditions on prostate cancer cell lines, 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines were incubated under pressurized and hypoxic culture conditions (2 PSI + 1%O2) for a minimum of 7 days. We compared cell growth, morphology changes, gene expression profiles and drug response to enzalutamide treatment. The growth of 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells was markedly inhibited under TME culture conditions, accompanied by distinct changes in cell morphology. 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells cultured under TME conditions exhibited increased resistance to enzalutamide treatment. Higher levels of AR-V7 expression were detected in 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines maintained for 7 days in TME culture conditions. RNA-seq data identified 700+ genes that were differentially expressed in 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines adapted to TME culture conditions. GSEA analysis identified signaling pathways associated with hypoxia, glycolysis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were upregulated under TME culture conditions, and the pathways of xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation were downregulated by TME culture conditions. In summary, adaptation to TME culture conditions can promote the expression of AR-V7 in prostate cancer cell lines and can contribute to enzalutamide drug resistance. Adaptation of cell lines to TME culture conditions can provide meaningful insights into mechanisms of drug resistance while providing a novel approach to identify targets and biomarkers of drug resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3b9e4c6f-bf8e-40d4-bdbb-d37fba298e6a\/@G03B8ZL7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Hypoxia,Androgen receptor,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11486"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yunmin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albert Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ann Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>James Lim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The human prostate is bounded by a smooth muscle capsule, and aggressive tumors invade through the muscle layer, called extracapsular extension (ECE), to escape organ confinement. The presence of ECE defines pT3a pathologic stage and is associated with increased risk of biochemical recurrence, metastases, and cancer-specific mortality. Although muscle invasion is required for ECE and metastatic spread, both the invasive tumor network phenotypes and muscle responses are understudied. The goal was to probe the molecular events of ECE to understand this critical step in metastasis.<br \/>Muscle invasion of prostate cancer cell lines was tested <i>in vivo<\/i> by injecting cells into the peritoneal cavity of male NSG mice. The cells colonize the inferior surface of the muscular respiratory diaphragm and invade through to the superior surface. To explore transcriptional regulators, we performed whole genome RNAseq on cells from three compartments: (1) &#8220;Inferior&#8221; non-invading cells on the underside of the diaphragm; (2) &#8220;Muscle-resident&#8221; cells that have invaded and now reside within the diaphragm muscle; and (3) &#8220;Superior&#8221; cells that have completely traversed the diaphragm. Tumors cells reaching the superior side of the diaphragm were established <i>ex vivo<\/i> as polyclonal cell lines termed the &#8220;KM&#8221; series.<br \/>RNAseq reveals 1,482 differentially expressed sequences (DES) between Inferior and Muscle-resident cells, 253 DES between Muscle-resident and Superior cells, and 896 DES between Inferior and Superior cells (padj &#60;0.05, |fold change| &#8805; 1.3). Further, we identified 84 DES that overlap between the Superior vs. Muscle-resident and Inferior vs. Muscle-resident groups, highlighting candidate gene changes unique to cancer cells in a muscle microenvironment. Importantly, 4,076 differentially expressed, mouse-specific RNA sequences (padj &#60; 0.05, |fold change| &#8805; 2.0) highlight pathways within muscle that respond to the presence of invasive tumors. Strikingly, the KM series have aggressive features including newly acquired bone metastasis and resistance to a taxane.<br \/>The gene expression patterns imply a dominant effect of the muscle microenvironment in evoking a new and transient tumor transcriptional response as revealed by the DESs. Independent of this response, the KM sub-populations successfully navigating the muscle were more aggressive in laboratory assays, including bone metastatic potential and chemotherapeutic resistance. These studies support the hypothesis that successful invasion into and through a contractile muscle layer results in aggressive cancer cells. Using the <i>in vivo<\/i> assay provides the unique ability to parse out unexplored patterns of changes that occur in early, muscle-invasive disease to improve prostate cancer patient selection for definitive treatment versus active surveillance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9637dcd8-9158-4623-ba64-ce3d108c550a\/@G03B8ZL7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Invasion,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Metastatic potential,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11487"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kendra D.

The inability to dissect heterogeneous tumor microenvironments (TME) and immune compartments partly contribute to this knowledge gap. Spatially resolved molecular tumor profiling can enhance our understanding of these complexities and bring us closer to personalized treatment; however, deploying such methods in oncology workflows is challenging as the prevalent tissue preservation technique of formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) leads to RNA degradation.We used tissue-wide whole transcriptome analysis with 10x Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution for FFPE tissue to resolve the tumor microenvironment of two prostate cancer samples. This assay incorporates ~5,000 molecularly barcoded, spatially encoded capture probes in spots over which the tissue is placed, imaged, and permeabilized. Imaging and sequencing data are processed together for spatially resolved transcriptional readout. We analyzed, and resolved whole transcriptome tumorigenic profiles in sections of normal, stage III invasive adenocarcinoma, and stage IV acinar cell carcinoma FFPE human prostate tissues. Computational clustering of the whole-transcriptome data automatically identified spatial gene expression patterns that aligned well with pathologist annotations. Well known prostate gland and prostate cancer markers were over-expressed in the corresponding healthy and cancerous tumor tissue, validating this method. The data showed that basal cells and luminal cells are spatially organized in healthy tissue while this pattern is lost in tumor samples as the luminal cells encroach the invasive carcinoma region and do not colocalize with basal cells. Moreover, T lymphocytes are dispersed throughout the whole tissue in the adenocarcinoma, while plasma B cells are in the peritumoral region which could impact prognosis. Using computational methods to infer CNV profiles, we identified aneuploidy regions and specific loci that may be driving the underlying genomic profile of the cancerous regions. We demonstrated that spatial whole transcriptome analysis can successfully resolve FFPE prostate samples. Whole-transcriptome data can rapidly confirm known patterns of cell type and tumor region-specific gene expression while giving a better understanding of the TME for drug target identification or biomarker discovery that may lead to patient-tailored therapies and improved patient stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c8bf32a3-2d90-4ad0-80ac-86edadb1acb2\/@G03B8ZL7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE),Histopathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11489"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen Richardson Williams<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valeria Giangarra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naishitha Anaparthy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mesruh Turkekul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paulius Mielinis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Gallant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil I.

This has precluded generation of a large-unified Atlas akin to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for scRNA, despite massive demand for such a resource.<br \/>Methods: We built the first training scRNA dataset that we know of that relies on using cell-type labels from published studies as a ground-truth metric. Using this dataset, we evaluated and trained a variety of models specifically for the task of integrating disparate data into a unified space. Further we developed a specific framework for evaluating how well unsupervised models perform at the task of integrating disparate data, using a new approach reliant on leave-one out validation of &#8216;unseen&#8217; datasets. Using deep-learning models, that performed best on the training dataset, we scaled integration of over 50 public datasets focused on solid cancers, that collectively contain over 1000 patient samples worth of data covering over 20 indications.<br \/>Results: The pan-cancer scRNA atlas produced by the above workflow is an order of magnitude larger than previous scRNA datasets and the first to span many indications alongside adjacent and separate normal tissue data. Analysis of this atlas reveals novel axes of variation in the tumor microenvironment linked to Cancer Associated Fibroblast (CAF) biology. For example: (a) We find CAF high samples vs. cancer high samples are enriched for T-cells in a na&#239;ve state; (b) Cancer vs. CAF rich samples result in variation in M2 like macrophage signatures; this compartmentalization is also seen in spatial RNA data; (c) A spectrum of CAF, perivascular, and endothelial like states is also observed indicating potential cell-type plasticity. Collectively, these observations identify novel biology and variation in the tumor microenvironment that will likely apply to many ongoing experimental projects and therapeutic programs.<br \/>Conclusions: We&#8217;ve used deep-learning to build one of the largest scRNA atlases to date, and potentially the first that will progressively release models and data as an open-source package to benefit the wider community. We anticipate the ability to resolve target expression at the single cell level will greatly enhance our understanding of the tumor microenvironment, as it aids our own efforts to drug CAF biology and the tumor stroma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1bb73264-ecbe-4251-af1e-b324cfa6ab37\/@G03B8ZL7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11490"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Javier Díaz-Mejía<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swechha X<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dylan Mendonca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Octavian Focsa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Harvey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mike Briskin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sam Cooper<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The constant interaction between a tumor and its microenvironment plays a critical role in how the cancer develops, progresses, and responds to therapies. Traditionally, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&#38;E) staining has been used to annotate and characterize tissues and associated pathologies. Recent single analyte approaches spatially interrogate targeted or transcriptome-wide expression of RNA in tissue sections, while others capture phenotypes using a limited number of protein markers. However, for a more comprehensive understanding of the unique characteristics of cell types, cell states, and cell-cell interactions within the TME, multiple layers of information are needed and must be studied together.<br \/>Here we demonstrate a novel, streamlined multiomic spatial assay that integrates histological staining and imaging with simultaneous transcriptome-wide gene expression and highly multiplexed protein expression profiling from the same formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue section. In short, tissue sections from archived FFPE samples were placed on slides containing arrayed capture oligos with unique positional barcodes. The H&#38;E or immunofluorescence stained tissues were then imaged, followed by incubation with transcriptome-wide probes and a high-plex DNA-barcoded antibody panel containing intra- and extracellular markers. Transcriptome probes and antibody-barcodes were then spatially captured on the slide and converted into sequencing-ready libraries. Our data analysis and interactive visualization software enable interrogation of all data layers (H&#38;E\/immunofluorescence, RNA, protein) from the same tissue section.<br \/>We apply this method to simultaneously measure gene and protein expression within the TME of human breast cancer and melanoma FFPE samples using whole transcriptome probes and an immune-oncology antibody panel. The data enables comparison and correlation of multiple analytes and their patterns within the same sample section. In addition, this simultaneous detection enables marker-guided regional selection and differential gene expression analysis on the defined regions. Taken together, our data demonstrates that a spatially resolved, multiomic approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of cellular behavior in and around tumors, yielding new insights into disease progression, predictive biomarkers, drug response and resistance, and therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/194016e1-e337-4bd4-87c5-f84594b0c43e\/@G03B8ZL7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Gene expression,Gene expression patterns,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11491"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cedric Uytingco<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Chew<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naishitha Anaparthy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun D.

The idea that deeper tumor clearance leads to better outcomes is widely accepted in MM treatment: minimal residual disease (MRD) testing, whereby ultra-sensitive sequencing or fluorescence-based cytometric detection of the clonal immunoglobulin secreted by tumor PCs, has been found to be the strongest independent prognostic factor when predicting survival. However, MRD status remains an imperfect predictor. As PCs have a well-defined physiological niche within the bone marrow (BM), and patients often exhibit immunosuppressive BM dysregulation, we investigate the presence of BM microenvironment signatures present at remission that may influence clinical outcomes insufficiently explained by tumor risk strata or MRD status. We conducted 3&#8217; single-cell RNA sequencing of 36 remission, 8 primary diagnosis, and 3 relapse whole BM aspirates taken from 35 patients enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial evaluating a treatment regimen consisting of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IRD). 19 of 35 patients were MRD+ at remission; among these, 6 have been reported as having poor outcome (PO; progression-free survival &#60;2.5yrs post sample collection), 12 have had average outcomes (AO; PFS &#62;2.5yrs), and 1 is awaiting assessment. The remaining 16 patients were MRD- at remission, 6 of whom had poor outcome, 7 average, and 3 awaiting assessment. Preliminary analysis of 43 samples have yielded an average capture of 8,620 cells per sample with 1,247 median genes per cell. In comparing 3 PO to 8 AO MRD- remission samples, we see clear polarity between PO and AO cells in every major immune lineage, with a majority of clusters being predominantly (&#62;80%) made of either PO or AO cells. Surprisingly, T, NK, and B cells from AO samples exhibit FOS\/JUN upregulation relative to those from PO samples, indicative of AP-1 transcription factor activity that is typically associated with cell proliferation. PO samples also exhibited signs of active cytotoxicity, including upregulated granzymes H and B and IL7R in T and NK cells. Sizeable PC populations were detected in several MRD- remission samples with subpopulation heterogeneity in the expression of MM marker genes; comparison against PCs isolated from healthy donor BM suggests possible persistence of disease phenotypes not captured by MRD testing. We further investigate BM microenvironment evolution between primary diagnosis, remission, and relapse timepoints to elucidate changes in response to tumor clearance.&nbsp; Overall, this study enhances our understanding of how immune surveillance and interaction may influence treatment response in MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dc77bddc-073d-4339-9dfc-c543bfab1eed\/@G03B8ZL7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Single cell,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11492"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia T.

We previously characterized the stroma of localized human prostates by Laser Capture Microdissection, and found that stroma was substantially different in prostates with and without tumor. Furthermore, a stromal gene signature reflecting bone remodeling was upregulated in high compared to low Gleason grade cases. To determine how stromal cells contribute to carcinogenesis and progression we study whether specific genetic alterations in the epithelium induce unique stromal changes. To do this, we utilized Genetically Engineered Mouse Models (GEMMs) representing common prostate cancer mutations and compared these to their wild-type conterparts: the <i>Tmprss2-ERG <\/i>fusion knock-in murine model induces histological alterations in the stroma in the absence of an epithelial phenotype; the <i>Pten<\/i> deletion mouse model (<i>Pten<sup>KO<\/sup><\/i>) results in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) but not invasive cancer; the <i>Hi-Myc<\/i> GEMM, leads to PIN and subsequently invasion; and the <i>Pb4-Cre +\/-;Pten <sup>f\/f;<\/sup> LSL-MYCN <sup>+\/+<\/sup>; Rb1 <sup>f\/f<\/sup> <\/i>(<i>MNRPD<sup>KO<\/sup><\/i>) mouse model that leads to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). We generated a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the mouse prostate cancer mesenchyme in these models. Using deep generative modeling followed by graph-based clustering and gene regulatory network inference, six (6) distinct subsets of fibroblasts and two (2) subsets of smooth muscle cells (myofibroblasts and pericytes) were identified. Notably, some subsets were common across all GEMMs and WT mice, while others aligned with specific genotypes. Moreover, we found a variable pattern of positive and negative <i>Ar<\/i> expressing cells between genotypes. Analysis by CellphoneDB of mesenchymal-epithelial communications revealed the complex cross-talk between mutated epithelial cells and the tumor microenvironment. Multiplex immunofluorescence phenotyping of mesenchymal cell confirmed the cluster subtypes by both expression and spatial location. Finally, stromal transcripts defining mesenchymal cluster subtypes associated with <i>Tmprss2-ERG <\/i>were conserved between mouse and human genotypes.This study lays the groundwork for understanding and ultimately targeting stromal-epithelial interactions in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11493"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hubert Pakula<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Carelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolo Fanelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madhavi Jere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caitlin Unkenholz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed Omar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Ribeiro- Fidalgo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filippo Pederzoli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cory Abate-Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David S.

The diversity of cell types and tissue organisation in skin cancer remains poorly understood yet is required to improve diagnosis and treatment. In this work, we integrated six imaging and sequencing technologies to build the first spatial single cell reference for all three major skin cancer types and create a comprehensive skin cancer interactome. Using single-cell RNA-Seq (RNA) of &#62;100,000 cells from 11 paired patient biopsies, we identified 28 SCC cell types, including 10 immune cell types, and found core suites of 39 cancer genes and 222 healthy genes shared across &#8805;80% patient samples. Using independent Nanostring Digital Spatial Profiling (RNA, protein), we validated most immune cell types and gene markers at protein and RNA levels. The enrichment of an immune signalling signature in SCC was further revealed by spatial Nanostring Single Molecular Imaging - SMI (RNA). Strikingly, we found the high consistency in mapping cell types in scRNAseq data and the independent SMI data, for example, the distribution of the three keratinocyte layers (basal, cycling and differentiated). This observation suggested the power of combining scRNAseq data with spatial SMI data. Furthermore, we implemented three approaches to validate the spatial distribution and cell type co-localisation by both Visium Spatial Transcriptomics (RNA), SMI (RNA) and Opal Multiplex Polaris (protein). Finally, cell-cell interactions were inferred at the global level using scRNAseq data (no spatial information) and Visium data (with spatial dimension), which were then validated at high throughput (517 ligands\/receptors) and single-cell resolution using SMI. These <i>in situ<\/i> interaction maps were built across all three cancer types to create a comprehensive spatial interaction atlas of skin cancer. We also used targeted approaches with Polaris (protein) and RNAScope (RNA) to confirm and visualise clinically-important ligand-receptor pairs, including checkpoint inhibitor drug targets PD-1 and PD-L1. By integrating six distinct yet complementary spatial and single cell technologies, this study highlights the power of a spatial multi-omics approach for understanding cell types and their activities in cancer tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/36c9b0e7-af2d-4e08-a11b-77df315a87be\/@G03B8ZL7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Single cell,Signaling,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11494"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Laura Grice<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guiyan Ni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinnan Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minh Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Killingbeck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Gregory<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Onkar Mulay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siok-Min Teoh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arutha Kulasinghe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Leon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Murphy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Warren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngmi Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Quan Nguyen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Recent studies focused in HLA allelic loss have been restricted to DNA-based approaches, and have not been validated orthogonally at the RNA or protein levels. Here, using clinical melanoma biopsies and patient-derived melanoma cell lines, we show that genetic alterations in <i>HLA <\/i>genes results in imbalanced allele expression, subsequently skewing antigen presentation by melanoma cells.<br \/>Methods: Whole exome and RNA sequencing (WES, RNAseq) analyses were performed on 760 melanoma biopsies and 60 patient-derived melanoma cell lines. Patient-matched normal WES was used to perform HLA haplotyping across Class I and II HLA genes. Tumor WES was analyzed for copy number alterations in chromosome 6, identifying which alleles were lost or gained. Differential expression of HLA alleles was quantified in tumor RNAseq, correlating the allelic imbalance at the DNA and RNA levels. Melanoma cell lines heterozygous for HLA-A*02, A*03, and A*24 were analyzed by flow cytometry for surface-level HLA protein expression using allele-specific antibodies to quantify allelic densities and compare the imbalance of HLA-A alleles at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels.<br \/>Results: Across 760 melanoma biopsies, copy number alterations in chromosome 6p were identified in 76% of tumors; 12% had LOH, and 54% had copy number gains that resulted in imbalanced copies of alleles. In paired tumor WES and RNAseq (N=682), genetic imbalance was correlated with imbalanced expression of HLA alleles in the classical Class I HLA genes (Spearman rho=0.64-0.7; p=2.2e-16); this association was strengthened in tumors with high tumor cellularity, and was not associated with the total expression of the HLA genes.These patterns were explored in a 60 patient-derived melanoma cell lines with matched tumor WES and RNAseq, confirming that alleles gained at the genetic level were also expressed at higher levels than alleles that were not gained or lost. In 10 cell lines heterozygous for either HLA-A*02, A*03, or A*24, allelic imbalance at the DNA and RNA level resulted in correlative imbalanced surface presentation of alleles at the protein level.<br \/>Conclusions: Evaluation of paired tumor WES and RNAseq revealed orthogonal validation of HLA allelic imbalance, and analysis in cell lines suggested that these patterns were likely tumor intrinsic. Experimental validation of these findings at the protein level suggests that antigen presentation density can be modulated by chromosomal gains, and not just allelic loss, in HLA genes. This knowledge is important for the design of cancer vaccines or T cell therapies targeting neoantigens presented by HLA class I complexes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/24e7e9bf-99b3-4ac3-9156-001bfd573744\/@G03B8ZL7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Melanoma\/skin cancers,HLA class I,Copy number alterations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11679"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katie M.

This study applied ST on 10 surgical biospecimens from a clinical trial with neoadjuvant therapy with cabozantinib (multi-kinase inhibitor) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Within our cohort, 6 of the samples were obtained from non-responders and 4 with demonstrated pathological response were previously associated with immune infiltration using spatial proteomics technologies. Our analysis with ST was performed to determine the specific pathways that drive immune infiltration in responders and to map intercellular interactions relevant for response and resistance to the combined therapy.Analysis of these data uncovered three main differences between responders and non-responders. First, to better understand the tumor mechanisms of response and resistance, we performed differential expression and pathway analysis only in the subset of tumor clusters from responders versus non-responders. In responders, we observed enrichment for pathways associated with immune response (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, T cell differentiation), while in non-responders the deregulated pathways are associated with cell growth, transcriptional activity and hypoxia (Myc, E2F, oxidative phosphorylation). Second, the intercellular interaction analyses indicate that CD8-HLA interactions are more abundant in responders, while interactions activating VEGFR, the main target of cabozantinib, are enriched in non-responders. The interaction profiles are evidence that in responders the tumor cells express tumor specific antigens that are recognized by the cytotoxic cells which activity is enhanced by nivolumab. In non-responders, the activation of the VEGF pathway is an indication that the tumor cells have developed mechanism of resistance to cabozantinib. Third, responding tumors have higher densities of immune and stromal cells, and the immune cells are enriched with aggregates composed of both B and T cells. The regions surrounded by these immune aggregates are transcriptionally distinct from regions enriched for stromal cells, suggesting that tumor gene expression profile drives immune infiltration.Overall, the ST analysis of neoadjuvant HCC treated samples detects tumor induced immune cell immune infiltration in responders compared to non-responders with enrichment of cytotoxic interactions to eliminate the tumor cells. It also identifies intercellular interactions suggestive of resistance to anti-VEGF blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/46ab1cb0-7a36-4743-ba9f-34b98f0c8fa2\/@H03B8ZL8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Spatial Transcriptomics,Cancer immunotherapy,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11681"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Luciane T.

Yet, it is unclear how CIN modulates the tumor-microenvironment (TME). Here we show that CIN results in a protumor TME with enrichment of immune-suppressive macrophages, a granulocytic infiltrate, and exhausted T cells. Using <i>ContactTracing<\/i>, a newly developed computational tool to infer conditionally dependent cell-cell interactions from single cell RNA sequence data, we identify tumor ligands induced by the ER stress response in cancer cells as central mediators of immune suppression. Mechanistically, CIN-dependent chronic activation of the cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway promotes ER-stress-dependent transcription. Suppression of CIN or depletion of cancer cell STING reduces ER-stress and restores CIN-induced changes on the TME. Correspondingly, chronic STING activation in human breast cancer patients is associated with reduced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and increased metastasis. Remarkably, pharmacologic inhibition of chronically active STING or depletion of downstream ER stress signaling suppresses metastasis in syngeneic models of melanoma, breast, and colorectal cancers, thereby demonstrating a viable therapeutic strategy for chromosomally unstable cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d23ae972-effd-4ed5-9815-6c1d78495d3f\/@H03B8ZL8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Unfolded protein response (UPR),Chromosomal instability,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11687"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jun Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Hubisz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ethan Earlie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mercedes A.

Using genotypes from over 8,000 European individuals in The Cancer Genome Atlas and 137 heritable tumor immune phenotype components (IP components), we identified and investigated 532 TIME-SNPs. Focusing on 77 variants that were relevant to cancer risk, survival, or treatment response, we explored their potential to reveal novel targets for immunotherapy. Many variants overlapped regions with histone marks indicating active transcription, and influenced gene activities in specific immune cell subsets, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. TIME-SNPs implicated genes such as LAIR1, TREX1, CTSS, CTSW and LILRB2 were differentially expressed between responders and non-responders to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical studies. Of these, LILRB2 and LAIR1 have already been identified as putative targets for immunotherapy. Here we found that inhibition of CTSS led to better tumor control and survival in murine models, alone or in combination with anti-PD-1.

An important question is what are the mechanisms that control IL-8 transcription in tumors. Various factors have been described but the main common denominator is NF-&#1082;B activation. In this regard, considering inflammatory mediators present in the tumor and whose receptors act as NF-&#1082;B inducers, TNF&#945; and IL-1&#946; became obvious candidates. In this study, we provide multiple lines of evidence that TNF&#945; and IL-1&#946; are able to elicit functional IL-8 from malignant cells in a manner that can be inhibited by clinically grade blockade agents.<i><\/i><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Short-term cultured human tumor cell lines, fresh human tumor explants and primary organoids were stimulated with TNF&#945; or IL-1&#946; to test for IL-8 induction. Moreover, syngeneic and xenografted tumors were also used to study IL-8 induction in response to TNF&#945; or to IL-1&#946;. Correlation between these cytokines and IL-8 transcripts were studied in TCGA and other databases to search.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><i> <\/i>We have been able to correlate IL-8 mRNA levels with IL-1&#946; and TNF&#945; transcripts in human cancers. Both cytokines induced IL-8 functional expression from a broad variety of human cancer cell lines, primary colon carcinoma organoids and fresh human tumor explants. Although IL-8 is absent from the mouse genome, a similar murine axis in which TNF&#945; and IL-1&#946; upregulate CXCL1 and CXCL2 in several mouse tumor cells was revealed. Furthermore, intratumoral injection of TNF&#945; and IL-1&#946; induced IL-8 release from human malignant cells xenografted in immunodeficient mice. In all these cases, the clinically used TNF&#945;-blockers infliximab and etanercept, or the IL-1&#946; inhibitor anakinra were able to interfere with this pathogenic cytokine loop. Moreover, treatment with checkpoint inhibitors augments TNF&#945; in syngeneic and xenografted tumors thereby turning on this immunosuppressive chemokine-driven axis. However, we have demonstrated that co-blockade of TNF&#945; and IL-1&#946; could equally enhance anti-tumor efficacy of &#945;PD1+&#945;CTLA-4 regimens as CXCR1\/CXCR2 inhibitors, reparixin and AZD5069, did.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b><i> <\/i>In this study, we have identified TNF&#945; and IL-1&#946; as major inducers of IL-8 transcription on human cancers. In keeping with these findings, both TNF&#945; and IL-1&#946; induce functional IL-8 release from all tested human tumor cell lines representing a variety of tissue origins, as well as from primary organoids and fresh human cancer explants. In all these cases, including xenografted human tumors, IL-8 induction could be blunted by the pharmacological blockade of TNF&#945; or IL-1&#946;. Finally, inhibition of this pathogenic cytokine loop could increase the anti-tumoral effect of checkpoint inhibitors.<i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5d6faf9-e12e-4d86-bf64-6e691f03db07\/@H03B8ZL8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TNF-&#945;,Interleukin-1,Interleukin-8,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18972"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Irene Olivera<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebeca Sanz-Pamplona<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elixabet Bolaños<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inmaculada Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iñaki Etxeberria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Assunta Cirella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saray Garasa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Itziar Migueliz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iñaki Eguren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miguel F.
