[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> ALK is a proto-oncogene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK, which can be aberrantly activated by gene rearrangements or point mutations to promote tumor cell growth, survival, and metastasis. ALK rearrangements are detected in approximately 4% of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) crizotinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and lorlatinib have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC. The durability of response to these therapies has been limited, in many cases, by the emergence of mutations that confer resistance to ALK. The major resistance mutation to alectinib, brigatinib, and ceritinib is the ALK G1202R solvent front mutation. The detection of resistance mutations has been improved with the evolution of biotechnology, making it possible to search for tumor-derived plasma free DNA as a liquid biopsy in cases where tissue biopsies are difficult to obtain. Digital PCR (dPCR) is an improved method of the conventional PCR method, which is more accurate and allows absolute quantification than the RT-PCR method. <b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> For a total of 9 patients, 2 patients newly diagnosed with ALK+ NSCLC by tissue biopsy and about to receive ALK-TKI and 7 patients already diagnosed with ALK+ NSCLC and receiving ALK-TKI, 10 ml of plasma was collected in addition to the blood collection at each 3-monthly visit. cfDNA was extracted and digital PCR was used to simultaneously detect 10 ALK mutations (T1151ins, C1156Y, L1196M, G1269A, F1174L, L1152R, V1180L, I1171T, G1202R, S1206Y). This Study was supported by an Investigator Initiated Research (IIR) from Pfizer. <b>Results:<\/b> The total number of samples analyzed in 9 cases was 65, and the median number of samples collected in each case was 7 (minimum 2 - maximum 12). cfDNA concentration was a median of 9.9 ng\/ml of plasma (4.0-35.8 ng\/ml). The number of samples detected for each mutation was 32 for G1202R, 16 for C1156Y, 5 for G1269A, 4 for F1174L, 1 for T1151ins, and 1 for I1171T. G1202R was detected in 19 of 37 samples during treatment with alectinib. The median time from detection of G1202R to clinical disease progression was 388 days (123-2004 days), with repeated emergence and disappearance in some cases. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> The dPCR method was highly sensitive in detecting gene mutations with low allele frequency. It was also found to be able to monitor variable resistance mutations over time during ALK-TKI treatment. In addition, we found that the appearance of G1202R did not always indicate clinical acquisition of resistance that required drug modification. A limitation of this study is that the mutations detected are not distinguishable between the same allele or Cis\/trans. In particular, EML4-ALK forms a trimeric protein, suggesting that single mutations such as G1202R and drug susceptibility do not always match in clinical specimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0e3dbbf3-52a0-4b3e-89fd-1c696056c2f6\/@y03B8ZBh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,ALK,Resistance,Droplet digital PCR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12641"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Takaaki Sasaki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noriko Hirai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshinori Minami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunsuke Okumura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shin-ichi Chiba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryohei Yoshida<\/i><\/presenter>.

Apart from their intracellular localization, members of different HSPs families such as Hsp70 have been found to be localized on the plasma membrane of malignantly transformed cells, including multiforme glioblastoma (GBM). However, the role of the membrane-bound mHsp70 has not yet been elucidated in the pathophysiology of GBM. We have assessed the mHsp70 expression in biopsies obtained from neuro-oncological patients employing inverted confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems) and CellVoyager CQ1 Benchtop High-Content Analysis System (Yokogawa). Live-cell imaging of the patient-derived biopsy revealed the increased cellular density of mHsp70-positive tumor cells particularly in the tissue along the tumor-brain margin (biopsy was derived 3 mm from contrast-enhancing margin and also within hyperintense FLAIR). Time-lapse analysis of the tumor sample further demonstrated the migration of mHsp70-positive cells into the surrounding culture medium. Subsequent high-powered multiplex immunofluorescence analysis (Akoya Biosystems Inc.) confirmed markedly increased single-cell infiltration of mHsp70(+) tumor cells (that were also co-immunofluorescently stained for SOX2, Nestin, and Oct4) in the normal brain tissues. In conclusion, expression of mHsp70 on the plasma membrane of tumor cells corresponds to the highly invasive potential of the GBM cells and recurrence of these tumors in neuro-oncological patients.

We sought to identify genomic and immunologic factors associated with recurrence after surgery in stage I NSCLC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We collected clinicopathologic data from patients with resected stage I NSCLC (AJCC 8th Edition) which underwent multiplexed immunofluorescence for CD8+, FOXP3+, PD-1+, and PD-L1. A subset of these samples also had next-generation sequencing performed to identify genomic alterations and tumor mutational burden (TMB). A bidirectional stepwise elimination was applied on variables with a univariable disease-free survival (DFS) p-value &#60;0.25. The final multivariable Cox model was validated with internal bootstrapping (B=300).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of<b> <\/b>252 cases were included. After a median follow-up of 25.6 months from the time of surgery, 47 cases (18.7%) experienced recurrence, with a 2-year DFS rate of 82.9%, and a 2-year overall survival (OS) rate of 97.9%. Shorter DFS was associated with higher TMB, increased PD-L1 expression, and greater numbers of intratumoral (IT) CD8<sup>+<\/sup>, PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>, and PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells, as well as increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and FOXP3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells at the tumor stroma interface (TSI) in univariable analyses (p&#60;0.05). Multivariable analysis showed that shorter DFS was associated with increasing TMB and higher PD-L1 tumor cell expression. We observed a difference by immune cell localization and risk of recurrence: shorter DFS was associated with higher IT but lower TSI PD-1+ immune cells, and higher IT but lower TSI FOXP3+ T cells (<b>Table<\/b>). Internal bootstrap validation showed good model performance (C-index = 0.74).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Genomic analysis and immunophenotyping of stage I NSCLCs can identify cases at greatest risk of disease recurrence after surgical resection.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{9D2E0EBB-6563-4B4E-952B-9B7D2CBC7818}\"><caption>Table.

Limited data exist about associations between Trop-2 protein expression, clinicopathological characteristics and outcome in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Given the approval of sacituzumab govitecan in unselected TNBC, its evaluation in other breast cancer settings and the emergence of other Trop-2 targeted antibody-drug conjugates, Trop-2 emerges as an important drug target in solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: Trop-2-expression of patients with TNBC diagnosed between 2000-2017 at UZ Leuven was determined with IHC (ab227689, Abcam) (continuous and categorical variables, high 201-300, medium 100-200 and low &#60;100 H-score). Associations of Trop-2-expression with age, BMI, germline <i>BRCA<\/i> status, tumor grade and size, histological subtype, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), presence of DCIS, nodal status, stromal TILs, androgen receptor (AR), standardized mitotic index, and outcome (invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), distant recurrence-free survival (D-RFi) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS)) were assessed. Associations with continuous variables were assessed by the Spearman correlation coefficient (&#961;). Group differences were assessed by the Kruskal Wallis test for multiple groups or Mann-Whitney U test for two groups. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between Trop-2 expression and outcome.<br \/>Results: Total of 658 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 53y (range 22-89y) were included, with median follow-up 9.6y. Low, medium and high Trop-2 expression was seen in 58.2%, 25.3% and 16.5% of cases. AR was positive in 25.5% of cases (10%-cutoff). Highest Trop-2 expression was observed in tumors with apocrine histology (median 180 score), and lowest expression in tumors with metaplastic histology (median 45 score) (p&#60;.001). Higher Trop-2 expression was correlated with higher AR expression (10%-cutoff) (p=0.009), more presence of nodal involvement (p=0.016), associated DCIS (p=0.004) and LVI (p=0.006).

Multiple causative etiologies, such as hepatitis B and C (HBV\/HCV), alcohol, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), lead to heterogeneous tumor microenvironments and modest at best responses to available therapy. Previous work has identified that high levels of negative elongation factor-E (NELF-E), part of the transcription regulating NELF complex, promote tumor progression and significantly lower overall survival in more than 38% of HCC tumors. Further studies identified a germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of NELF-E, rs79208225 (G to A), with a rate of 1% in the general population and 9% in HCC patients. Also, the SNP was shown to affect splicing, leading to a decrease in NELF-E mRNA expression. Thus, our hypothesis was HCC patients with the NELF-E SNP would have better overall outcomes and, by biologically mimicking the SNP, we could improve tumor burden.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Genomic DNA from a diverse patient population was analyzed between 2016 and 2021 from our institution. Sanger sequencing was performed to detect the SNP. T-tests, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression analyses were performed on patients with clinical data to characterize differences between SNP and non-SNP HCC patients (STATA 17). Additionally, three HCC cell lines were treated with anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to mimic the splicing effects associated with the SNP. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot, and xCELLigence real-time cell analysis, RNA and protein expression as well as proliferation was compared after treatment.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results: <\/b>The rs79208225 SNP was found in 3.8% of patients in our population (8\/208). Of interest, Chinese patients were more likely to have the SNP compared to other races (OR 3.38, 95% CI: 1.002-11.4, <i>p=0.05<\/i>). All SNP patients&#8217; causative etiology was HBV. No correlation was found between age and sex. Patients with the SNP survived significantly longer (52.8 v 30.5 months, <i>p=0.02<\/i>) and had significantly longer time to recurrence (52.8 v 25.0 months, <i>p=0.001<\/i>) after surgical resection.<b> <\/b>After treatment with the ASOs, we found significantly reduced wild-type NELF-E mRNA and protein expression, consistent with HCC patient samples. Moreover, cell proliferation of HCC cells treated with the two ASOs significantly decreased compared to control.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>There<b> <\/b>is a correlative relationship between race, etiology, and improved outcomes in HCC patients with the SNP. Specifically, in patients with the SNP, survival was on average 22.3 months longer and disease-free survival was 27.8 months longer. ASOs can be used to mimic the beneficial phenotype seen in patients who carry the mutation. Further studies will include <i>in vivo<\/i> studies using the ASOs and expanding work determining the clinical significance of the SNP in HCC patients. <b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f48d7ed-ba22-437b-b42c-d4a113e82918\/@y03B8ZBh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Prognostic markers,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12791"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"f7a44f39-477f-4550-8cbd-4632b106c969","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f7a44f39-477f-4550-8cbd-4632b106c969\/@y03B8ZBh\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan Lamm<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Barry-Wolbers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keyur Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hien T.

In this study we evaluated the ability of TIS to be a prognostic biomarker of survival benefit in patients with moderated and high residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients and its correlation with residual TILS after NAC.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed 46 samples of residual disease of breast cancer patients who received NAC and were under surgery between 2013 - 2018, with high risk of recurrence defined as Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) group II and III. TIS signature was evaluated using the Research Use Only version of 18-gen signature algorithm. Median of TIS score was 5.88, TIS score were categorized in four groups by quartiles and defined as low TIS score (lower quartile, score &#8804; 4.82) and high TIS score (score &#38;gt; 4.82). In addition, we quantified the percentage of stromal TILS in residual disease, categorizing level of TILS in high and low level using median (20%) as a cut-off. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method and the associations with Cox regression model. Correlation between TIS and TILS was performed whit Pearson coefficient. Clinical data was collected of medical records.<br \/>Results: The median age at diagnosis was 50 years (26y - 78y), 65.2% of patients were Luminal B subtype, 63% were clinical stage IIIB, 26.2% were RCB II and 73.9% RCB III. No correlation between TIS score and percentage of stromal TILS was founded (p = 0.264). After median follow-up of 60 months, estimated median PFS for high TIS score was 71.7 vs 18.2 months for low score (HR = 0.28, 95% CI [0.13-0.64], p = 0.002), and estimated median OS for high TIS score was non-reached vs 40.9 months for low score (HR = 0.28, 95% CI [0.11-0.68], p = 0.005).

The objective of this study was to identify biomarkers with potential benefits to AAM prostate cancer patients. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis coupled with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and leading-edge genes analysis showed that the keratin family of genes, including <i>KRT8<\/i>, <i>KRT15<\/i>, <i>KRT19<\/i>, <i>KRT34<\/i>, and <i>KRT80<\/i>, constituted the single most prominent family of genes enriched in AAM compared to European American (EAM) prostate cancer cell lines. In prostate cancer patients (TCGA and MSKCC patient cohorts), only <i>KRT8<\/i>, <i>KRT15,<\/i> and <i>KRT19<\/i> expression were relatively higher in AAM than in EAM. The differences in the expression of <i>KRT15<\/i> and <i>KRT19<\/i>, but not <i>KRT8,<\/i> were enhanced by Gleason score and ERG fusion status; in low Gleason (Gleason &#8804; 6 [TCGA cohort] and Gleason &#8804; 7 [MSKCC cohort]), the expression of <i>KRT15<\/i> and <i>KRT19<\/i> was significantly (p &#8804; 0.05) higher in AAM than in EAM patients. Survival analysis revealed that high expression of <i>KRT15<\/i> and <i>KRT19<\/i> was associated with increased risk of biochemical recurrence in low Gleason category patients in the TCGA patient cohort. Interestingly, <i>KRT15<\/i> and <i>KRT19<\/i> expression was associated with an increased risk of death in the metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma (SU2C\/PCF Dream Team, PNAS 2019) cohort, suggesting the potential to predict the risks of disease recurrence and death in the low Gleason category and advanced disease conditions respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed known oncogenic gene signatures, including KRAS and ERBB2, to be enriched in patients expressing high <i>KRT15<\/i> and <i>KRT19<\/i>. Furthermore, high KRT15 and KRT19 were linked to the basal and LumA prostate cancer subtypes associated with poor postoperative androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) response compared to the LumB subtype. Taken together, the present study identifies genes with high expression in AAM than in EAM prostate cancer. The identified genes are linked to oncogenic gene signatures, including<br \/>KRAS and ERBB2, and to basal and LumA prostate cancer subtypes that are associated with poor postoperative ADT response. The study, therefore, reveals biomarkers with the potential to address biomarker bias in prostate cancer diagnosis and\/or prognosis. Future studies would explore the diagnostic and\/or prognostic potential of identified markers in prostate cancer tissue samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fb7c621d-4f12-4b25-86e0-7a4914fdabbb\/@z03B8ZBi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,African American,African American,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12793"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joakin Opeli Mori<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason White<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Balasubramanyam Karanam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clayton Yates<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Honghe Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

It has been described in preinvasive and invasive LUSC and represents one of the most striking molecular differences between LUSC and adenocarcinoma. Many studies evaluated the prognostic value of 3q amplification; however, they either studied the entire region (~40 genes) or 1-2 genes of biological relevance (e.g SOX-2, p63). In this analysis, we aim to describe the prognostic relevance of 3q by focusing on a minimal common region (MCR) of amplification within 3q constituted of 25 genes. Additionally, we examined the association between MCR amplification and other genetic alterations commonly found in LUSC, such as CDKN2A deletion.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We conducted an analysis of 499 cases of LUSC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The majority identified as white (90.2%) and 9.8% as African American (AA) or Asians; 73.7% were males, 7 patients had stage IV disease. We found amplification of MCR (chr3:181,711,924-183,428,101) ~1.7MB within a large amplified region between (chr3:170,169,718-187,736,569) ~17.5MB on chr 3q. All 25 genes within MCR were found to be frequently amplified. Molecular data was available for 476 patients in CBioPortal, amplification of MCR was found in 221 (44.3%) cases whereas 255 (51%) cases had no amplification. Median disease specific survival of MCR-amplified cases was significantly longer than non-amplified cases (NR versus 9.25 years; 95% LowerCI: 5.24; log-rank p&#60;0.05). Median progression-free interval for amplified cases was 8 years (95% LowerCI: 5.1) versus 4.9 years (95% LowerCI: 3.5) for non-amplified cases (Log-rank p&#60;0.05). In multivariable analysis, MCR amplification was associated with significantly improved progression-free survival (HR for progression 0.67, CI 0.47-0.95, p=0.024) and disease specific survival (HR for death 0.59, CI 0.38-0.94, p=0.025). CDKN2A homozygous deletion, a common genetic alteration in lung cancer, was detected in 126 patients, 70 with MCR amplification and 56 with no amplification.

MRI radiomic tumor features may aid in prognostication and tailoring of treatment in cervical cancer. We extracted whole-volume radiomic texture features from 124 manually segmented tumors and performed unsupervised clustering yielding two distinct clusters. Overlapping clinicopathologic, genomic (whole exome sequencing, n=61), transcriptomic (L1000 arrays, n= 65) and molecular biomarker (n=82) data were applied to characterize the clusters. Independent of tumor size parameters, patients in cluster II had significantly reduced disease-specific survival as compared to those in cluster I (p&#62;0.001), also within squamous cell carcinomas (n=96, p&#60;0.001). Cluster II associated with high age (p=0.02), high FIGO-2009 stage (p&#60;0.001), high BMI (p=0.03) and PR negative tumors (p=0.004). Distinct mutational and copy-number profiles were detected for the two clusters. By gene set enrichment analyses, gene sets associated to immune activation were enriched in cluster I tumors, whilst gene sets associated with oxidative phosphorylation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition associated to cluster II tumors. This study links radiomic signatures to distinct genomic profiles that may potentially aid in prognostication and tailoring of treatments in cervical cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95a8c5e2-cbe2-4c48-a138-b1d72a958d56\/@z03B8ZBi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Magnetic resonance imaging,Prognostic markers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12797"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mari Kyllesø Halle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erlend Hodneland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erling Hoivik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kari Wagner-Larsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Njål G.

TNFR2 is commonly overexpressed in cancer cells and in the tumor microenvironment. It is also a key receptor in immune evasion, due to its abundance on the most immunosuppressive subset of Treg cells (CD4+Foxp3+), as well as its role in driving proliferation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor cells via activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) pathway. In environments with high cell proliferation and high surface densities, TNFR2 can be cleaved and shed as serum soluble TNFR2 (sTNFR2). In human cancers, high sTNFR2 has recently been associated with poor prognostic outcomes in colon cancer, esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer and non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas. Elevated sTNFR2 is also potentially associated with poor prognostic outcomes in cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs), a diverse group of lymphomas primarily composed of mycosis fungoides (MF) and S&#233;zary syndrome (SS), with symptoms that primarily manifest in the skin. Given sTNFR2&#8217;s accessibility in serum and association with cancer prognosis, we investigated its role as a potential biomarker for MF and SS prognosis. We also evaluated whether the CTCL tumor type is mechanistically being driven by very suppressive Tregs and tumor cells with this oncogene. In our study, we measured baseline sTNFR2 levels from 31 serum samples across different cancer stages (Stage I-IV) of MF and SS in either treatment-na&#239;ve subjects or subjects free of any treatments for &#8805;3 months. Our initial data shows that sTNFR2 values correlate with levels of blood disease and increase as the cancer advances. These findings strengthen the possibility of using sTNFR2 as a biomarker in MF and SS and also support the possible mechanistic role of TNFR2 in disease pathogenesis. Analysis of the same serum samples for sTNFR1, a non-specific marker of inflammation and renal failure, confirm that the increases are exclusive to sTNFR2 and can indeed be attributed to MF and SS, rather than to non-specific inflammation. Further studies following these patients&#8217; responses to their treatment plans (i.e., mogamulizumab, romidepsin) will help elucidate the potency of sTNFR2 in predicting response to treatment and cancer burden.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fde9b1d7-e6c9-4a92-bb30-0ebcb1f8f4f3\/@z03B8ZBi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Prognostic markers,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12798"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Amanda Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youn Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Khodadoust<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Denise L.

A better understanding of drivers of ET resistance is required as subsequent lethal metastatic disease remains a major clinical problem. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need to identify biomarkers that select low- and high-risk patients who may benefit from de-escalation of current treatments or alternative therapeutic interventions. In the present study, we hypothesized that while luminal A and B tumors both arise from normal hormone-responsive cells, they are transcriptionally distinct, hence allowing the identification of unique gene signatures that can predict outcomes in each subtype.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tumors from<b> <\/b>10 early-stage ER+\/HER2- BrCa patients were subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis (10X Genomics); 6\/10 tumors were classified as luminal A and 4\/10 as luminal B based on combined PAM50 and immunohistochemical classification (Ki67 cut-off=20%). We performed a direct transcriptional comparison between luminal A and B tumors, using well-established signatures and unbiased differential gene expression analysis. To identify unique luminal A and B tumor-specific genes, we compared the gene expression profile of each luminal subtype with 10 non-neoplastic breast tissues. A predictive model (LASSO) was applied to select genes with the highest frequency using a training dataset. This resulted in 5- and 4-gene signatures for luminal A and B, respectively, which were used to calculate risk scores that divided each subtype into low- and high-risk groups. The prognostic value of the above signatures was validated in an independent dataset.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The integrated scRNA-seq analysis of luminal A and B tumors revealed transcriptionally distinct tumor cell clusters while tumor microenvironment (TME) clusters were well intermixed. Luminal B tumors had higher cell cycle and BrCa-specific scores, low ER pathway-gene expression scores, and increased 8q amplifications. IFN&#947;, OXPHOS, p53, hypoxia and MYC targets were the most upregulated pathways in the luminal B subtype. The TME of luminal B tumors was comprised of lower CD4+ and CD8+ T cell but higher T<sub>reg <\/sub>levels. Comparison with normal breast tissues revealed that early-stage ER+ BrCa arises from hormone-responsive epithelial cells and provided a number of tumor-specific genes that were used to generate prognostic signatures. These signatures were capable of differentiating high- from low-risk patients within each subtype and predicting survival outcomes in two large-scale training and validation cohorts.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We developed a novel prognostic tool that can be used to determine duration of adjuvant ET and\/or new therapeutic strategies for high-risk luminal A and B patients in the early-stage ER+\/HER2- setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13290c4a-38db-471c-9f25-16486a060aa0\/@z03B8ZBi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Single cell,Breast cancer,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12802"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sofia Mastoraki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jerome Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiayu Rao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie R.

We demonstrated that bladder cancer (BC) cells release protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a redox-regulated ER-resident protein, via extracellular vesicles (EVs) when experiencing high levels of ER stress for their own survival. Chronic exposure to PDI-enriched BC EVs induced malignant transformation in recipient non-transformed cells. We hypothesized that the dynamic redox state in BC cells determines PDI cellular localization and tumors with elevated PDI preferentially incorporate PDI into EVs for removal. Furthermore, PDI expression levels and subcellular localization in tumors from NMIBC patients may predict NMIBC recurrence.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> Retrospective chart review identified 122 patients with newly diagnosed low-grade NMIBC classified into 2 groups: recurrent (N=55) and non-recurrent (N=67) during follow-up period. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor specimens from index transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) were obtained and a tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed. Immunofluorescent staining of TMA sections was conducted using antibodies against PDI and BiP, an ER stress marker. Stained tissues were photographed and tumor regions in each field were manually masked and confirmed by a genitourinary pathologist. Within each tumor region, total antibody labeling was determined by measuring the mean pixel intensity values with NIH ImageJ\/Fiji. Manders coefficient was used to assess the colocalization of epitopes using JACoP plugin in ImageJ.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> Tumor tissues from patients that recurred expressed significantly higher levels of PDI and BiP. Moreover, high PDI and BiP expression predicted worse recurrence-free survival. These data suggest that tissues under higher levels of ER stress&#8212;as indicated by higher levels of PDI and BiP expression&#8212;have a higher risk of recurrence. Significantly higher levels of PDI were detected in non-ER cytosol in recurrent cohort tumors.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> This study provides a novel mechanism for BC recurrence and valuable clinical predictive biomarkers for NMIBC recurrence and progression. Future clinical applications targeting this pathway may be an avenue to prevent NMIBC recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79ce27c1-b2e8-4fc4-a9ed-583a839a2864\/@z03B8ZBi\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Biomarkers,Prognostic markers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12804"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kit L.

Addressing socioeconomic and behavioral status has not been enough to reduce disparity, suggesting racial difference in BrCa biology. Our laboratory was the first to show the involvement of CC chemokines in BrCa. In this study, using ONCOMINE, TCGA, bc-GenExMiner, KMplotter, and antibody microarray, we examined the association of CC chemokines in BrCa outcomes and disparity. We show over-expression of CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, and CCL25 in BrCa tissues. High mRNA levels of CCL7, CCL8, CCL17, CCL20, and CCL25 predicted a decrease in overall survival (OS). CCL7 and CCL8 were associated with decreased relapse-free survival. Expression of CCL17 and CCL25 was associated with decreased OS in AA. In EA, CCL8 was associated with decreased OS. Expression of CCL5, CCL7, CLC8, CCL17, CCL20, and CCL25 was highest in TNBC. The expression of CCL11 and CCL22 was associated with HER2 expression. CCL7, CCL8, CCL17, CCL20, and CCL25 were elevated in AAs. Since CCL25 showed a significant association with decreased OS in AA, we examined the expression of CCR9, which is the only receptor for CCL25, and CCR9-mediated signaling in BrCa cell lines derived from AA and EA. Our data show higher expression of CCR9 in AA than EA and distinct molecular cascade in cells derived from AA than EA. Furthermore, higher CCR9 expressing cells showed poor response to Carboplatin upon CCR9 activation. In conclusion, our data suggest the association of distinct CC-chemokines in BrCa progression, OS, and disparate disease outcome in AA compared to EA patients implying CCR9 signaling to be a potential target for improving chemotherapeutic response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17aae2cf-d64d-4d28-ad55-2790ab4e008f\/@A03B8ZBj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Chemokines,Biomarkers,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12805"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hina Mir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Briana A.

Significant racial disparities also exist in incidence and clinical outcome. African American (AA) men are nearly two times more likely to be diagnosed with PCa and have more than twice mortality rate than their Caucasian American (CA) counterparts. Despite an early diagnosis in majority of the cases, about one-third patients face biochemical recurrence following local therapy, with a likelihood of developing distant metastasis. Gleason score used as a prognosticator exhibits discrepancy between AA and CA men highlighting the need for better predictive markers. We previously demonstrated functional significance of MYB in PCa growth, aggressiveness, and castration-resistance. We also showed a role of MYB in sustained androgen receptor (AR) signaling under androgen-deprived condition and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression. Here, we studied the expression of MYB in PCa by immunohistochemistry and examined if it varied between AA and CA PCa cases and had any clinicopathological correlation. A total of 105 PCa [CA (n=50) and AA (n=55)] cases with available clinicopathologic data were included. MYB expression was also studied in adjacent benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplastic (HGPIN) lesions. Stained slides were scanned and digitally analyzed for the measurement of percent positivity (0-100%) and staining intensity (1+, 2+ and 3+). Significant overexpression of MYB (p&#60;0.0001) was reported in PCa relative to HGPIN and BPH. PCa predominantly exhibited moderate to strong staining, compared to weak to moderate staining with low precent positivity rate in HGPIN and weak MYB staining with low percent positivity in BPH. A significantly higher expression of MYB (p&#60;0.0001) was noted in high Gleason score (8-9) PCa, compared to the low-medium Gleason score (&#8804;7) PCa. Interestingly, MYB expression was significantly (p= 0.024) higher in AA PCa than CA PCa in overall and Gleason score wise comparisons. Correlation analysis of MYB showed its inverse association with time to BCR (r&#8201;=-0.467, 95% CI=-0.675 to -0.190, p=0.002). Altogether, our findings establish MYB as a potentially useful biomarker for PCa diagnosis and prognosis and provide clinical support to our prior findings on the pathobiological role of MYB in PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f7882b18-c1a2-4c6a-a87e-d0f1a7139ef8\/@A03B8ZBj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Biomarkers,Immunohistochemistry,Prostate-specific antigen (PSA),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12808"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohammad Aslam Khan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Srijan Acharya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shashi Anand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fnu Sameeta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James E.

We aimed to clarify the biological role of Parkin in ccRCC and to evaluate its expression in a clinically characterized renal cancer cohort.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We analyzed cell lines and clinically annotated patient material with qPCR (n=63), immunohistochemistry (n=262), LC-mass spectrometry and performed functional analyses in cell line models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found that overexpression of Parkin results in a less aggressive phenotype in the clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell line 786-O indicated by lower migration and invasion. Mass spectrometry revealed decreased levels of several proteins in Parkin expressing cells. One of these proteins was cyclin kinase subunit 2 (CKS2). The introduction of a C431S mutation in the catalytic domain of the Parkin gene abolished the effect of decreased migration. In addition, knockdown of CKS2 in cells lacking Parkin caused decreased migration suggesting that the effect of Parkin is CKS2 mediated. Furthermore, the correlation of CKS2 and tumor grading is highly significant and high levels of CKS2 are associated with shorter survival times.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Parkin plays a major role in ccRCC biology, regulation cell migration and invasion, possibly exerted by CKS2 signaling. In consequence CKS2 appears to be an interesting prognostic biomarker in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and might also serve as a new therapy target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c3533e73-739b-4d1b-9c6a-c4a4d1fb554c\/@A03B8ZBj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Migration,Kidney cancer,Prognosis,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12809"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Laura Kristin Esser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vittorio Branchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Farhad Shaker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrian Georg Simon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carsten Stephan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Glen Kristiansen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Buness<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hubert Schorle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Marieta I.

Effective VTE risk assessment models exist for other cancers, but not glioma. Our prior publications suggested a protective role of IDH1 mutations (IDHmut) against VTE, and a direct correlation between circulating Tissue Factor (TF), a procoagulant secreted by cancers, and VTE in glioma patients. Others have found a correlation between inflammatory markers and cancer-associated VTE, but this has not yet been proven in gliomas. Our objective was to evaluate glioma patients for increased VTE risk by assessing clinical, histologic, molecular, and plasma-based markers.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The Northwestern University Nervous System Tumor Bank provided preoperative arterial plasma, tumor tissue, and clinical-pathological data from 165 newly diagnosed glioma patients. Molecular profiling was done by GlioSeq NGS. Twelve candidate VTE biomarkers (D-dimer, E-Selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, Granzyme B, IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13) were analyzed using the automated microfluidic multiplex Ella<sup>TM<\/sup> platform.

Clinical characteristics associated with increased VTE risk included advanced patient age, high body mass index, high tumor grade, prior history of VTE, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Of the targeted genetic screening panel (GlioSeq) on resected tumors, only IDHmut significantly correlated with VTE, being associated with reduced risk (OR=0.28; 95% CI=0.12-0.64, <i>P<\/i>=0.001). Among the plasma biomarkers, elevated circulating TF activity and D-dimer correlated with VTE risk. Circulating TF (&#62;2.0pg\/mL) was associated with VTE (Log-rank, <i>P<\/i>=0.002).

The extracellular matrix (ECM) has also been recognized as an important driver for cancer development. The most dominant ECM proteins are the collagens, which are important for tumor stiffness, tumor immunity and cancer metastasis. However, most of the cancer research of collagens has focused on the abundant and already well-described collagens, such as type I, III or IV collagens, whereas many of the more poorly described collagens remain unexplored. Type XX collagen is one such collagen. In this study, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantifying type XX collagen, named PRO-C20, using a monoclonal antibody raised against its natural C-terminus and quantified circulating type XX collagen in patients with cancer.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Optimizations to the PRO-C20 protocol included finding the time and temperature of incubation as well as the assay buffer and concentration of assay components that gave the best sensitivity in serum. PRO-C20 was measured in serum of 219 patients with a range of solid cancer types and compared to serum levels in 33 healthy controls. The patients with cancer included 20 patients each of pancreatic-, colorectal-, kidney-, stomach-, breast-, bladder-, lung-, melanoma-, head and neck- and prostate-cancer as well as 19 with ovarian cancer. PRO-C20 was also subsequently measured in a separate cohort comprising 36 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and compared to 20 healthy controls. The biomarker performance of PRO-C20 was evaluated by ANOVA, ROC-curve analysis and cox proportional hazards models.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The PRO-C20 ELISA was optimized and validated to be specific, precise and robust. PRO-C20 was significantly elevated in all cancers tested (p&#60;0.01 - p&#60;0.0001). PRO-C20 could discriminate between cancer and healthy controls with area under the receiver operating characteristic values ranging from 0.76 to 0.92. Elevated levels of PRO-C20 were confirmed in a separate cohort of patients with PDAC when compared to healthy controls (p&#60;0.0001). In addition, high PRO-C20 levels were associated with higher overall mortality (HR: 4.25, 95%CI: 1.52-11.9, p-value: 0.006) after adjusting for age, sex and the presence of metastasis.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>An ELISA optimized to measure circulating type XX collagen in serum (PRO-C20) was successfully developed. Type XX collagen was elevated in serum of patients with cancer and high levels were associated with higher overall mortality in PDAC suggesting PRO-C20 has diagnostic and prognostic biomarker potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0c81a7f8-4763-47d5-9e4e-8fde0ba33012\/@A03B8ZBj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Collagen,Biomarkers,Extracellular matrix,Serum,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12811"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeppe Thorlacius-Ussing<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Jensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilie A.
