The identification of neoantigens as drivers of effective anti-tumor immunity has promoted the development of neoantigen-based therapeutic strategies, including vaccines and cell-based therapies. One challenge for these approaches is to accurately predict neoantigens. Most mutations are unique to each patient and only a fraction are immunogenic. The generation of large-scale mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics training data for the development of deep learning models has resulted in significantly improved computational methods for prediction of neoantigen presentation on HLA. In addition, on-going efforts to characterize antigen determinants involved in TCR recognition may also contribute to further improving immunogenicity prediction. However, induction of neoantigen-specific T cells may not be sufficient for efficacy. We used the MC38 cancer model to characterize the factors associated with effective neoantigen-specific T cell responses after vaccination. We designed two RNA-LPX vaccines (Deca-1 and Deca-2), each encoding 10 MC38 neoantigens. The two vaccines elicited T cell responses with comparable magnitude and functionality. Prophylactic vaccination with either vaccine prevented establishment of MC38 tumors, confirming that vaccine-induced T cells can recognize and kill tumor cells. Surprisingly, while vaccination with Deca-2 was protective in therapeutic settings, vaccination with Deca-1 was unable to reverse growth of established tumors. Neoantigen-specific CD8 T cell migration to the tumor was comparable between the two vaccines, but the phenotypes of the T cells were significantly different. Gene expression analysis revealed specific activation states of T cells that differed according to their antigenic specificity and clonal expansion, suggesting intrinsic differences across different T cell specificities. Remarkably, T cells elicited by Deca-1 exhibited a gene signature of reduced functionality at the tumor site and also in the spleen, the primary site of vaccine activity. Our study has important implications for the development of neoantigen therapies, as it suggests that the properties of the neoantigen\/TCR pairs influence the phenotype of vaccine-induced T cells at the tumor site and therapeutic outcome. Furthermore, our results indicate that the tumor may influence the phenotype of vaccine-induced T cells outside the tumor microenvironment. Additional experiments are on-going to further define the exact nature of these determinants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Neoantigens,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lelia Delamarre<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
