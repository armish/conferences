[{"Abstract":"Self-Microemulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SMEDDS) can greatly increase the bioavailability of agents with limited solubility. Studies were performed to characterize the efficacy of BR-9001, a SMEDDS formulation of 3,3&#8217;-diindolylmethane (DIM), in preventing preneoplastic and neoplastic prostate lesion development in Hi-Myc mice. Beginning at age 8 weeks, groups of 105 male Hi-Myc mice received twice daily oral (gavage) administration of BR-9001 (BioResponse LLC, Boulder, CO) at DIM-equivalent doses of 0 (vehicle control), 200, or 400 mg\/kg\/dose. At ages 4 months, 5.5 months, and 7 months, cohorts of 35 mice\/group were euthanized and necropsied; at each time point, tissues were collected from 25 mice\/group for pathology; 5 mice\/group for analysis of DIM levels in the plasma and prostate; and 5 mice\/group for biomarker analysis. Prostate lesion development in pathology cohorts was determined by microscopic evaluation of step sections through the entire accessory sex gland block. Plasma and prostate levels of DIM were quantitated by LC-MS\/MS; biomarkers were analyzed by RT-PCR. Administration of BR-9001 produced dose-related levels of DIM in the plasma and prostate at all time points. However, BR-9001 provided at most limited protection against prostate lesion development. Most lesions were identified in the lateral prostate (LP), where statistically significant reductions in incidences of murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (mPIN) were seen in 4-month-old mice receiving the high dose of BR-9001 and in 5.5-month-old and 7-month-old mice receiving the low dose of BR-9001. Reductions in mPIN incidence in groups receiving BR-9001 were due to lower incidences of small mPIN lesions; incidences of large mPIN were significantly increased at 5.5 months in both groups receiving BR-9001. BR-9001 had no statistically significant effect on % occupancy of the LP by mPIN, the incidence of microinvasive mPIN in the LP, or cancer incidence in the LP. In the anterior prostate (AP), incidences of atypical hyperplasia were similar in all groups. However, at all necropsy time points, mice receiving the high dose of BR-9001 demonstrated significant increases in the incidences of moderate to marked AP atypia; these increases were accompanied by decreases in the incidence of mice with slight to moderate AP atypia. None of 22 potential molecular biomarkers were found to be clearly linked to development and progression of prostate lesions in Hi-Myc mice. Despite the presence of measurable concentrations of DIM in the plasma and prostate in mice in both treated groups at all time points, BR-9001 demonstrated equivocal efficacy in preventing the development of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the Hi-Myc mouse model of prostate cancer.

Emerging evidence suggests that cancer likely involves multiple mutations. Therefore, compounds targeting multiple signal transduction pathways would be ideal for the prevention and treatment of cancer. Mahanine, a carbazole alkaloid isolated from an Indian folklore medicinal plant <i>Murraya koenigii (<\/i>known as Curry Patta<i>),<\/i> widely<i> <\/i>consumed in traditional dishes, have been shown to possess anticancer activities and confound many oncogenic signaling events in breast, colon, and prostate cancers. In the current study, we determined the anticancer potential of mahanine against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant lung cancer cells and postulate the possible mechanism of action. Mahanine was isolated from the dried leaves of <i>Murraya koenigii <\/i>by hydro alcoholic extraction and fractionation with ethyl acetate, followed by preparative UPLC to isolate pure (&#62;95%) compound and its identity was confirmed by LC-MS\/MS and NMR spectroscopy. Antiproliferative activity of mahanine was determined against drug- sensitive (A549 and H1299) and taxol-resistant (A549-TR) human lung cancer cells. Mahanine showed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant lung cancer cell growth. Interestingly, the IC50 values of mahanine were essentially the same for drug sensitive (A549) (12.5 &#181;M) and drug- resistant (12.5 &#181;M) lung cancer cells; the IC50 value was somewhat lower (10 &#181;M) against highly metastatic H1299 lung cancer cells. Mahanine attenuated the colony formation and reduced the wound healing of lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, mahanine dose dependently impeded the oncogenic markers such as KRAS, MET, AKT, mTOR and cMYC. Together, mahanine demonstrate ability to inhibit both drug- sensitive and drug-resistant lung cancer cells and modulate distinct oncogenic molecular targets providing potential to be developed for the treatment of drug-resistant and metastatic NSCLC (Supported from Duggan Endowment funds).<br \/><b>Keywords: <\/b>Mahanine, Lung cancer, Oncogenes, Plant therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b34e68d-8817-4a41-9ad3-89ea00768150\/@y03B8ZKv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-05 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Oncogene,Therapeutic target,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14175"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Raghuram Kandimalla<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Farrukh Aqil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Disha N.

Given the positive association of terbufos and fonofos with PCa in Agricultural Health Study (AHS), we evaluated the association between N-6\/N-3 and PCa, and any potential effect modification by terbufos and fonofos exposure.<br \/>Study Design: This case-control study was nested within AHS cohort of farmers with dietary data. Cases with all PCa were identified through the statewide cancer registries. Self-administrated questionnaires assessed diet in 1999-2003 and pesticide in 1993-1997. We summed percentages of energy intake from N-6 (Linoleic acid+arachidonic acid) and N-3 (Eicosapentaenoic acid+docosapentaenoic acid+docosahexaenoic acid+&#945;-linolenic acid) and categorized the N-6\/N-3 into quartiles. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs), controlling for age at dietary assessment, race, physical activity, smoking, terbufos, fonofos, diabetes, lycopene, family history of PCa, and the interaction of N-6\/N-3 with age, terbufos and fonofos. We also conducted a stratified regression analysis by ever-never exposure to terbufos and fonofos.<br \/>Results: The multivariate analysis revealed that the lowest N-6\/N-3 quartile was significantly associated with a decreased risk of PCa (aOR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.41-0.9) relative to the top quartile. Comparing two strata of terbufos and fonofos exposure (ever-never), the OR in each N-6\/N-3 quartile was slightly smaller within &#8220;never&#8221; group versus the same quartile in ever-exposure with nonsignificant CI limits.<br \/>Conclusion: A lower N-6\/N-3 was associated with decreased risk of PCa. No significant interactions between organophosphate pesticides and N-6\/N-3 were observed.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{8D17D078-1F2C-4850-9984-852E1E2D2DAB}\"><caption

To understand the metabolism of metastases, we compared the metabolomes of pulmonary metastases of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) with that of normal lung tissues from mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet. In a 2x2 design, male C57BL\/6 mice, with or without a subcutaneous LLC inoculation, were fed the standard AIN93G diet or a high-fat diet (HFD), which provided 16% or 45% of energy from soybean oil, for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, lung metastases from injected mice and the lungs from non-injected mice were harvested for untargeted metabolomic analysis of primary metabolism by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). We identified 91 metabolites, 70 of which differed among the four groups. Pathway and network analyses along with the discriminant analysis showed that amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism were altered the most in metastases compared to the normal lung tissue (e.g., aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathways and the citric cycle). A 60% decrease in glutamine and a 25-fold elevation in sorbitol were observed in metastases. Cholesterol and its metabolite dihydrocholesterol were 50% lower in metastases than in the lungs. The HFD elevated arachidonic acid and its precursor linoleic acid in the lungs from non-LLC-bearing mice, which reflected dietary fatty acid composition of the HFD. However, such elevation did not occur in metastases from HFD-fed LLC-bearing mice, suggesting alterations in fatty acid metabolism during LLC metastatic progression. Differences in metabolomes between LLC pulmonary metastases and the normal healthy lungs identified in the present study can be useful in designing targeted studies for prevention and treatment of metastasis using this spontaneous metastasis model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7902a83-12c2-4883-8dd5-24f61d16c266\/@y03B8ZKv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Lewis lung carcinoma,Metabolomics,Diet,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14178"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lin Yan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sneha Sundaram<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bret M.

Previous studies have shown that androgen receptors (AR) are widely expressed in approximately one-third of TNBC, and are referred to as luminal androgen receptors (LAR). AR has recently emerged as a prognostic and treatment-predictive biomarker in breast cancer. However, the role of AR in TNBC remained elusive. Treatment with AR-antagonist have been shown to suppress AR activation and signaling in TNBC and results in a corresponding reduction in tumor cell proliferation and survival due to the initiation of apoptosis in these tumor cells. &#947;-Tocotrienol (&#947;T3) is a natural isoform of vitamin E that displays potent anticancer activity. Results show that treatment with 0-7 &#956;M &#947;T3 induces a dose-responsive significant decrease, whereas treatment with 35 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT) results in a significant increase of AR expression and corresponding increase in growth of MDA-MB-453 TNBC cells. Combined treatment of 7 &#956;M &#947;T3 with 35 nM DHT significantly inhibits DHT-induced proliferation and AR activation in MDA-MB-453 cells. Western blot analysis shows that combined treatment with &#947;T3 and DHT induced a significant decrease in phosphorylated ERK1\/2 (active form) expression, but had no effect on total ERK1\/2 levels in MDA-MB-453 TNBC cells. Flow cytometry analysis shows that &#947;T3 treatment was also found to induce G0\/G1 cell cycle arrest and significantly increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells, as compared to MDA-MB-453 TNBC cells in the vehicle-treated control group. Western blot analysis shows that &#947;T3 treatment also inhibited DHT-induced elevations in CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 expression (cell cycle progression biomarkers) and induces a significant increase in the expression of tumor suppressor protein, p53, in MDA-MB-453 TNBC cells. Similar treatment with 7 &#181;M &#947;T3 induces a corresponding significant increase in apoptosis biomarker expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax in MDA-MB-453 TNBC cells. In summary, results from these studies demonstrated that &#947;T3 treatment inhibits AR expression, activation and signaling, as well as DHT-dependent cell proliferation and viability in TNBC. These finding also suggest that the LAR may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment TNBC. This study was supported in part by funding from the Louisiana Cancer Foundation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5cfa36d3-4aa8-4c97-a109-eed95016db2d\/@z03B8ZKw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tocotrienol,Androgen receptor,Cell cycle arrest,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14181"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tasmin A.

However, research focused on understanding the role of microbial communities in the progression of pre-cancerous lesions to cancer in Latino women is scarce. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the cervicovaginal microbiome and inflammation while considering cervical neoplasia and HPV infection in Puerto Rican women. We collected cervical swabs and lavages from 142 participants coming to colposcopy clinics in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Genomic DNA was extracted from swabs, and 16S rDNA V4 region genes were amplified and sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. Inflammatory (IL-1&#946;, TNFa, IFNg, IL-6), anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10, TGF&#946;1), and trafficking (IL-8, MIP1a, MCP1, IP10) cytokines were measured from cervical lavages, using Luminex MAGPIX technology. Cytokines were related to microbes via an inflammation scoring index based on the quartile and tercile distribution of the cytokine&#8217;s concentration. IL-10 (p value= 0.0455) was significantly different when evaluating HPV risk, while IL1-&#946; (p value= 0.0005) and INF-&#947; (p value= 0.0258) were significant when evaluating cervical disease. We found significant differences in diversity and composition of the microbiota among HPV risk, cervical disease, pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and trafficking cytokine abundances. The increasing concentration of IL1-&#946;, IL-10, and INF-&#947;, associated with a decrease in&nbsp;<i>Lactobacillus<\/i>&nbsp;communities. While contrarily, bacteria associated with dysbiosis such as&nbsp;<i>Gardnerella<\/i>,&nbsp;<i>Prevotella<\/i>,&nbsp;<i>Atopobium<\/i>&nbsp;increased. This study also revealed that the most dominant community state types (CST) among Puerto Rican women regardless of lesion or HPV status, are CST3 and 4 featuring high diversity and anaerobic bacteria typical of vaginosis in Caucasians. These CSTs are especially abundant with ~ 90% dominance in participants with high grade disease (HGSIL) and high-risk HPV. Our study evidence that the cervical microbiota of Puerto Ricans is characteristically diverse and that the joint host-microbe interaction analyses via cytokine signaling and microbiota in pre-cancerous lesions has great translational potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/78a96e04-0540-4264-afd2-a5989ababe97\/@z03B8ZKw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Cervical cancer,Cytokines,Hispanic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14182"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eduardo Lemuel Tosado Rodríguez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anelisse Dominicci-Maura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loyda Mendez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Dorta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josefina Romaguera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filipa Godoy-Vitorino<\/i><\/presenter>.

Previous efforts in our laboratory found the <i>USP<\/i> gene in stool samples; more frequently found in stool samples from adenoma and CRC patients than in samples from healthy individuals. New efforts in our laboratory aim to find the USP protein in the same population of patient samples and this may require anti-USP antibodies, which at present are not commercially available. In this work, we report the first anti-USP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the detection of USP in human samples. A total of 38 hybridoma supernatants containing mAbs were assayed by immunoblotting and biolayer light interferometry (BLI) for their ability to recognize purified USP(&#8710;HNH). Results from BLI showed that the pair AB-A10 and AB-D5 presented the highest affinity with slow dissociation, moving forward for the development of a sandwich ELISA. Using AB-A10 as the capture antibody, and AB-D5 as the top antibody, results from the ELISA showed signals that were concentration-dependent above 6 ug\/mL of USP. We also used the AB-D5 and AB-D10 in immunoblots for the detection of USP in proteins extracted from stool samples of patients with adenoma and CRC. The immunoblots reveal the detection of a 25 kDa protein that remains unidentified but is present only in some of the samples. This could be the first detection of USP protein directly in a biological sample. Efforts are underway to identify this protein band and confirm its identity as USP. Additional efforts are aimed at increasing the number of stool samples analyzed to establish whether USP protein is a risk factor for CRC or adenoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/43d66508-4896-4f4f-8947-5f564b96010c\/@z03B8ZKw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Microbiome,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14183"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachell Martínez-Ramírez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valeria Toro-Díaz Toro-Díaz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pearl Akamine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Ruiz-Rosado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignacio Pino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abel Baerga-Ortiz<\/i><\/presenter>.

Aberrant activation of the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is associated with obesity, cross-sectionally, as well as with breast cancer survival. This study aimed to examine the association of weight change between one year before and following cancer diagnosis with a panel of mTOR protein markers in breast tumors. The study hypothesis was that greater weight gain compared to less or no weight gain would be associated with higher mTOR protein expression in breast tumors.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>Study participants were 698 newly-diagnosed breast cancer cases (545 Black women and 153 White women) from the Women&#8217;s Circle of Health Study (WCHS). Surgical tissue microarrays were stained for mTOR, phosphorylated mTOR, phosphorylated AKT, and phosphorylated P70S6K using immunohistochemistry. In-home interviews were conducted approximately 10 months after breast cancer diagnosis, and anthropometric measurement was taken by trained staff. Participants reported body weight one year before the diagnosis, excluding the time of pregnancy or nursing. Linear regression analyses were conducted to estimate percent differences in protein expression across quartiles of weight change, adjusting for age, race, BMI one year before diagnosis, menopausal status, history of diabetes, and molecular tumor subtype.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Study participants had a mean age of 52.7 (SD = 10.8) years and BMI one year before diagnosis of 30.7 (SD = 6.9) kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>.

The fourth vs. first quartile of the weight change was associated with a higher protein expression of mTOR (35.3%, 95% CI = 3.8%, 76.5%), and there was a dose-response pattern (P-trend = 0.0273).

Dysregulation of PI3K-mTOR pathway is commonly associated with TNBC and other ER-negative breast cancers.

Mice were observed daily for tumor formation and drug toxicity. The percentage of tumor free mice was recorded, and time to tumor development was visualized using Kaplan-Meier curves and analyzed using the generalized Wilcoxon test.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Treatment with everolimus significantly increased median survival of all mouse models. Everolimus treatment was also able to completely prevent mammary tumor formation in 27% of C3(1)\/SV40Tag mice and 44% p53-mutant mammary gland mice. In p53-null mammary gland mice, 46% of control mice had developed tumors after 420 days, compared to 7% of everolimus treated mice. Long term treatment of everolimus was associated with mild toxicity that includes slight weight loss (&#60;10%) and skin changes (matted hair, skin erythema).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Everolimus significantly delayed mammary tumorigenesis in all five breast cancer mouse models. Our results suggest that everolimus is a promising cancer preventive drug for ER-negative tumors, and that further studies of everolimus in combination with other targeted therapies are warranted. In the future, clinical trials of the everolimus should be considered for the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk patients.

To determine the preventive\/ therapeutic activity of silibinin on the progression of UVB-induced microscopic BCC lesions to more advanced BCC, both male and female 8 weeks old Ptch1<sup>+\/- <\/sup>mice were irradiated with 240 mJ\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> UVB dose 3 times\/week (M, W, F) for 26 weeks, and thereafter, UVB irradiation was stopped. At this point (after initial UVB exposure for 26 weeks was stopped), these Ptch1<sup>+\/- <\/sup>mice were randomized into 3 groups: Baseline group (mice euthanized for baseline data); Vehicle group: mice treated topically with acetone for 20 more weeks, and Silibinin group: mice treated topically with silibinin (9 mg in 200 &#181;L acetone), once a day for five days\/week for 20 more weeks i.e., till 54 weeks of mice age. Assessment of BCC and non-BCC lesion pathology was performed following &#946;-galactosidase and H&#38;E based histopathological analysis. Results indicated that compared to BCC-associated pathologies observed at baseline, acetone exposure for another 20 weeks resulted in a significant increase in the number (~2 folds, P&#60;0.001) and area (~3.4 folds, P&#60;0.001) covered by BCC lesions. There was also a significant increase in epidermal dysplasia, fibrosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma incidence. Notably, topical application of silibinin during this phase significantly decreased BCC numbers as well as area covered by BCC lesions by ~76% (P&#60;0.001) and ~88% (P&#60;0.001), respectively. This protective effect of silibinin was associated with decreased proliferation of basal cells and decreased expression of Hh signaling molecules (Smo and Gli1). To further delineate the changes associated with silibinin&#8217; s protective effect at the transcriptomic level, RNA sequencing studies were performed in skin samples from all three groups as well as non-UVB exposed control mice. Clustering of mRNA profile by sparse Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) showed that UVB exposed tissues (not treated with silibinin) were significantly different from non-UVB controls; most notably, silibinin treatment (after UVB exposure) reversed this phenomenon and the transcriptomic profile of silibinin group was almost similar to non-UVB controls. This indicated that topical silibinin was not only able to protect against progression to advanced BCC but had the potential to even normalize the aberrant gene expression driving BCC formation. In addition, Gene ontology enrichment analysis as well as Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed silibinin-associated enrichment in the calcium and CX3CR1-mediated signaling pathway, and TGF-&#946;-mediated regulation of the extracellular matrix. Taken together, these results highlight the potential of silibinin to be an effective preventive and\/or therapeutic modality against BCC growth and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71f4227a-8db5-451e-af10-bc27cd6eedd1\/@z03B8ZKw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-05 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skin,Hedgehog,Chemoprevention,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14200"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Komal Raina<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandeep Paudel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neha Mishra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sushil Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David J.

Women at increased risk can reduce this by use of anti-endocrine agents, but often decline these drugs to their adverse effects. Therefore, alternative strategies with greater acceptability are needed. We have previously shown that licochalcone A (LicA) from licorice (<i>Glycyrrhiza inflata<\/i>) suppresses aromatase expression and activity, enhances the activity of detoxifying phase II metabolism enzymes, and reduces estrogen genotoxic metabolism in cell lines and animal models. However, its effects on the breast tissue of high-risk women have not been studied. We hypothesize that LicA creates a tumor preventive environment in the breast by locally modulating cholesterol and steroid hormone biosynthesis, and antioxidant\/anti-inflammatory response.<br \/>Methods: We prepared microstructures from fresh tissue of contralateral unaffected mastectomy specimens of 6 postmenopausal women with incident unilateral breast cancer. We exposed these microstructures to DMSO (control) and LicA (5 &#181;M) for 24 h. After total RNA sequencing, we examined differential gene expression between treated and control samples using the limma R package. Enrichment results were generated by analyzing the up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets using Enrichr. A gene ontology (GO) pathway analysis was performed. The enriched pathways with combined enrichment scores &#62; 4 and FDR &#60; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We performed confirmatory qPCR experiments in samples obtained from 18 additional women.<br \/>Results: We observed significant (P &#60; 0.05) upregulation up to 8-fold of antioxidant genes NQO1, HMOX1, G6PD, SQSTM1, PGD, and GPX2. Significant upregulation of Nrf2, the transcription factor involved in the activation of antioxidant enzymes, was evident. In addition, we observed the significant (P &#60; 0.05) downregulation, ranging from 4 to 32-fold of cholesterol biosynthesis and transport genes, MSMO1, FDPS, EBP, SQLE, MVD, MVK, IDI1, DHCR7, NSDHL, FDFT1, LSS, ABCA1, ABCC3, ABCG1, steroid hormone biosynthesis genes HSD17B7, STS, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1, as well as lipid metabolism genes ACAT2, ACYL, FADS1, FADS2, ELOV6, CYP51A1, and LDLR. Some of the genes are shared between these pathways. The significant upregulation of the regulators of these pathways, SREBF1 and SREBF2 provided further confirmation.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data suggest that LicA can lead to a tumor-preventive breast microenvironment by reducing cholesterol and steroid hormones and lowering oxidative stress mediators. These observations along with the popularity of natural products, suggests that LicA might be a good candidate to be studied further as an alternative breast cancer prevention agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/73fc6e03-d32a-45ef-b566-7fbb22404b46\/@z03B8ZKw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-05 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural products,Prevention,Breast cancer,Patient-derived model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14201"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Atieh Hajirahimkhan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Bartom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Clare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seema A.

It arises in basal cells of skin that line the deepest layer of the epidermis. The most important risk factor for BCC is solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation that results in DNA damage (CPDs formation) in skin epidermis, which, if not repaired, leads to fixation of mutations and initiation of skin carcinogenesis. One of the key molecular features of BCC is sustained activation of Hedgehog signaling (Hh) pathway through inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor gene Patched (Ptch) or activating mutations in Smoothened (Smo). Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to target activated Hh pathway for the treatment of BCC, though with toxic side effects. With regards to chemoprevention of BCC, the agents which target the events associated with UVB-induced DNA damage repair, together with targeting promotion\/ progression stages, might provide more effective broad-spectrum opportunities to intervene at the earliest. Utilizing the well-established patched (Ptch)+\/- mouse model of UVB radiation-induced BCC formation, our approach in this study was to target BCC development and its prevention by employing silibinin (a natural flavonolignan from milk thistle seeds). Previously, we have extensively reported the efficacy of silibinin against UVB-induced photodamage and photo-carcinogenesis, and also recently reported silibinin efficacy against BCC growth in cell culture (including anti-BCC drug-resistant cell lines) and mouse BCC allograft tumors. In this study, both male and female (Ptch)+\/- mice were irradiated with 240 mJ\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> UVB dose, 3 times per week (M, W, F) for 26 and 46 weeks with or without silibinin. Silibinin (9 mg\/200&#956;l of acetone) was applied topically, 30 min post and pre-UVB exposure. Our study shows that chronic UVB exposure induced BCCs in Ptch+\/- mice. Treatment with silibinin post and pre-UVB exposure for 26 weeks decreased BCC lesion numbers (39-65%), and cross-sectional area (45-72%) p&#60;0.001, respectively compared to UVB alone. Furthermore, continuous UVB exposure up to 46 weeks increased the BCC lesion number by &#61566;6 folds and cross-sectional area by &#61566;3.4 folds (p&#60;0.001) respectively. Notably, silibinin (irrespective of post and pre-UVB treatment) significantly halted the progression of BCC (81-94%, p&#60;0.001), even upon prolonged UVB exposure. Histological analysis showed increased dysplasia, fibro-sarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma upon UVB exposure, which significantly decreased upon silibinin treatment. In addition, mechanistic studies revealed that silibinin significantly decreased basal cell proliferation (Ki-67) and the expression of cytokeratins (14 and 15), and Hh signaling mediators Smo and Gli1 in the BCC lesions. Together, our findings demonstrate that silibinin has the potential to prevent the growth and progression of UVB-induced BCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/61499788-f75b-4213-96cc-83a4ac206db7\/@z03B8ZKw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-05 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skin carcinogenesis,Hedgehog,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14202"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sandeep Paudel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Komal Raina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vasundhara R.

Innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to stop the progression of precancerous lesions into aggressive PDAC, which remains a lethal malignancy. The goal of this research project is to test the immunopreventive strategies by targeting the ectonucleotidase CD73, one of the gatekeeper enzymes responsible for adenosine production and the formation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in this malignancy. We hypothesize that inhibition of CD73 will prevent pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) formation and progression to PDAC by reversing immunosuppression.<br \/>Materials and methods: A syngeneic PDAC mouse model was employed by injecting 100k murine pancreatic cancer (KPC) cells in flanks of C57BL\/6 female mice. Oral gavage of AB680 (small molecule CD73 inhibitor) was given three days\/week at 10mg\/kg starting the day after KPC injections and tumor sizes were measured weekly. Toxicity was analyzed by serum ALT analysis. At the time of death 6 weeks post-KPC inoculation, tumor volume and mass were recorded. In another experiment, AB680 was administered 3 days\/week at 10mg\/kg for 5 weeks. CyTOF immunoprofiling of digested tumors from control and AB680 treated mice and HPLC analysis on serum from the time of death were performed.<br \/>Results: In experiment 1, by week three of the study, there was a significant difference in tumor volume between the control and AB680 treated groups (P=0.02). However, in weeks 4-5 AB680 reduced tumor growth compared to vehicle controls, but the grouped statistical analysis was not significant. When observing individual tumors, there was a reduction in tumor size in 30% of the AB680 treated mice between weeks 3-5, but the difference was not statistically different. ALT analysis determined AB680 does not induce liver toxicity. For experiment 2 (3x\/week treatment with AB680), there was a significant reduction in tumor growth. Activated CD8-positive T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages were significantly increased in the syngeneic tumors from AB680 treated mice. The intratumoral adenosine levels were significantly decreased in AB680 treated mice compared to vehicle treated mice.<br \/>Conclusion: We conclude oral gavage delivery of CD73 inhibitor AB680 at 10mg\/kg (6x\/week) reduces tumor growth in KPC syngeneic tumor bearing mice. Treatment with AB680 at 10mg\/kg 3x\/week significantly increases tumor doubling time, significantly alters intratumoral immune cell populations, and results in a significant decrease in intratumoral adenosine levels.

Intensive chemotherapy can disturb the gut microbiome, which may be associated with treatment-related toxicities. This study aimed to compare profiles of the gut microbiome in children with solid tumors pre- and post-chemotherapy with those of healthy children.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A case-control study was conducted in 44 children (21 with solid tumors and 23 healthy). Children aged 7-18 years with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy were recruited from Children&#8217;s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA); healthy children were recruited by e-news in CHOA. The gut microbiome was measured using stool specimens that were collected pre cycle 2 chemotherapy and post the completion of all chemotherapy for cancers, and only once for healthy controls. Demographics and clinical variables (e.g., race and use of antibiotics) were reported by parents. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene V4 region was amplified and sequenced. Bacterial taxonomies were assigned using the Silva reference via QIIME 2. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance, analysis of composition of microbiomes, and linear discriminant analysis effect size were used to compare the gut microbiome between cancer and healthy children.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Children with solid tumors and healthy controls showed no differences in age, race, and BMI; more boys were enrolled in the solid tumor group than the healthy group (p=0.009). Both groups were dominated by phyla <i>Firmicutes<\/i> and <i>Bacteroidetes<\/i>. Compared to healthy children, children with solid tumors had significantly lower &#945;-diversity metrics: Shannon p=0.042 and Chao1 p=0.015; children pre- (Shannon p=0.021; Chao1 p=0.024) and post-chemotherapy (Shannon p=0.011; Chao1 p=0.025) showed lower &#945;-diversity metrics than healthy children; and difference was not significant between children pre- and post-chemotherapy. The &#946;-diversity analysis (Bray-Curtis distance) showed that study group (p=0.008), gender (p=0.017), race (p=0.009), and cancer type (p=0.001) impacted the gut microbiome dissimilarities. Children with solid tumors had a lower abundance of phylum <i>Verrucomicrobiota<\/i>and a higher abundance of genus <i>Acidaminoccous <\/i>than healthy controls; healthy children had a higher abundance of beneficial genera <i>Prevotella <\/i>and<i> Akkermansia<\/i>.

LS is caused by germline mutations in one of four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, generating several hundreds of mutations in microsatellite coding sequences. Although defects in the MMR machinery are the principal mechanism driving LS carcinogenesis, the role of the epigenome through histone and DNA methylation remains unexplored. Hypermethylation of <i>MLH1 <\/i>is detected in 15% of sporadic MMR-deficient CRC and also in LSCRC, indicating a pivotal role of DNA methylation in LSCRC. In this study, we investigated the landscape of DNA methylation and EZH2-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in LS tumor samples, and tested the preventive effects of GSK-503, on tumor formation using a novel LS mouse model.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We profiled the somatic mutational, global DNA methylation landscape, and performed ChIP-seq in LS precancers and tumors. Patient-derived organoids (PDO) from colonic tissues treated with EZH2 and 5-AZA were used for gene expression analysis. LS mice (<i>Villin-Cre;Msh2<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>;Tgf<\/i><i>&#946;RII-KI<\/i>) were treated for 9 weeks with EZH2 inhibitor GSK503 to assess the effect on polyp formation <i>in vivo<\/i> monitored through murine colonoscopy.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Our mutational profiling via whole-exome-seq and gene expression survey of 10 LSCRC and 33 pre-cancers showed accumulation of somatic mutations and aberrant expression patterns in key epigenetic regulators including <i>EZH2<\/i> and <i>DNMT3A, <\/i>which suggests dysregulation of epigenetic control in LS. Global DNA methylation using RRBS in tumors of 3 LS patients showed that gene promoters were more hypermethylated when compared to matched normal samples. Immunohistochemistry data showed higher expression of EZH2 in tumors when compared to precancerous and normal colonic mucosa. ChIPseq analysis demonstrated high levels of H3K27me3 present in gene promoters of stem cell marker genes (<i>WNT9A<\/i>, <i>LGR5, <\/i>and <i>ASCL2<\/i>), and immune-related genes (<i>CD4, CD8a, <\/i>and <i>HLA-E<\/i>). Interestingly, 577 out of 2756 DNA hypermethylated genes from RRBS analysis displayed high levels of H3K27me3, thus indicating a central role of EZH2 in epigenetic programming of LS neoplasms. RNAseq data from PDOs treated with 5-AZA (DNMT inhibitor) and GSK503 (EZH2 inhibitor) showed that both epigenetic inhibitors led to the reactivation of silenced genes in colorectal carcinogenesis such as <i>CDKN2A, RUNX3, IGFBP3<\/i>, and immune genes, including <i>CD40, CD4<\/i>, <i>SEMA3B, CXRC6\/6, <\/i>and<i> ICAM1<\/i>. Finally, a 9-week chemo-preventive treatment of a cohort of LS mice with GSK503 significantly decreased polyp formation when compared to control, and polyp reduction was associated with increased infiltration of cytotoxic CD8a<sup>+<\/sup> Tcells and NK in the large intestine mucosa.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>These results demonstrate the chemopreventive potential of EZH2 inhibitors in prevention of LS-associated tumors through an immune modulation approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5b517e66-b4c8-4495-b441-3a09955bb835\/@A03B8ZKx\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-05 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Chemoprevention,Lynch syndrome,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14220"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laura Reyes Uribe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles M Bowen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyera Evans<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fahriye Duzagac<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krishna Sinha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eduardo Vilar<\/i><\/presenter>.

This highlights the need for epidemiological studies to employ novel exposure assessment methods to objectively measure early life exposures. Many metals are considered known or probable human carcinogens, primarily based on studies of adult cancers. We seek to determine the association between pre- and postnatal uptake of metals and ALL risk.<br \/>Methods: Children with and without ALL were recruited from Texas Children&#8217;s Hospital. Each participant donated 2-5 primary teeth for analysis. Using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, we measured 8 metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, magnesium, zinc) and calcium in teeth from 61 children with ALL and 6 without. In teeth, dentin and enamel form at different times, creating visible growth rings, which allowed us to objectively measure metal uptake for every week from up to 20 weeks before birth to 55 weeks after birth. At each timepoint, the ratio of metal to calcium was calculated to normalize the data. For each metal, we calculated the average prenatal uptake (i.e., 20 weeks before birth to birth) and average postnatal uptake (i.e., first week after birth to last available measurement). The average metal uptake in cases were compared to controls. To identify more specific window(s) of susceptibility, we used distributed lag regression, allowing us to incorporate data measured at all timepoints.<br \/>Results: Compared to children without ALL, children with ALL on average had higher prenatal uptake of chromium (0.50 vs 0.43; p=0.07), manganese (1,969 vs 1,888; p=0.20), and lead (0.04 vs 0.02; p=0.03) and lower prenatal uptake of cadmium (0.01 vs 0.02; p=0.0004), copper (0.07 vs 0.10; p=0.19), magnesium (0.24 vs 0.29; p=0.35), and zinc (22 vs 24; p=0.01). Average prenatal uptake of arsenic was similar between cases and controls (0.01 vs 0.01; p=0.13). A similar pattern was observed with postnatal uptake of metals. Using distributed lag regression, prenatal uptake of manganese 10 to 20 weeks before birth was significantly associated (p&#60;0.05) with risk of ALL, but a significantly protective association was observed starting at ~5 weeks after birth. While no other metals had a significant association with ALL, there was suggestive evidence that pre- and postnatal uptake of lead and chromium were positively associated with ALL, while pre- and postnatal uptake of zinc and copper were inversely associated.<br \/>Conclusion: Using a novel exposure method to measure metal uptakes at specific windows of susceptibility in primary teeth samples, our results suggest certain metals may contribute to the etiology of ALL. A larger study is needed to draw more definitive conclusions about early-life uptake of metals and risk of ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/940363f0-99dd-4319-b178-173a9b6cb06d\/@A03B8ZKx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-08 Molecular markers in prevention research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Environmental exposure,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14221"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thanh Hoang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manish Arora<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Austin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul C.

Despite recent advances in treatment, the overall 5-year survival rate remains low, primarily due to late diagnosis, acquired resistance to therapy, and distant metastases. Hence, development of novel therapeutic strategies is required to improve patient outcomes. The MDM2 gene is amplified in some patients with ESCC, frequently decreasing the tumor suppressive function of p53. In addition, 40-60% of ESCC tumors exhibit p53 mutations. Missense mutations within the p53 gene cause its overexpression and subsequent activation of p38 MAPK signaling. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of combining a p38 MAPK inhibitor and an MDM2 antagonist as a potential therapeutic strategy in ESCC.<br \/>Methods: To determine the synergistic anti-tumor activity of the MDM2 antagonist siremadlin (HDM-201) and the p38 MAPK inhibitor Ralimetinib dimesylate (LY2228820), we performed cell viability, colony formation, apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis in ESCC cell lines. Next, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of HDM-201 and LY2228820 in a xenograft mouse model. Finally, we performed siRNA mediated silencing of p53 to assess its functional role in the MDM2 antagonist-induced activation of p38 MAPK signaling and its ability to modulate the DNA damage response (DDR) by measuring ROS status and phosphorylation of H2AX.<br \/>Results: HDM-201 exerted cytotoxic effects in p53-mutated ESCC cells in a dose-dependent manner and activated the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. These results prompted us to combine the p38 MAPK inhibitor LY2228820 with HDM-201 and evaluate this novel treatment strategy in a p53-mutant pre-clinical model of ESCC. We observed that HDM-201 and LY2228820 acted synergistically to decrease cell viability (p&#60;0.01) and colony formation (p&#60;0.01), as well as induction of apoptosis (p&#60;0.01) and G<sub>2<\/sub>\/M phase cell cycle arrest (p&#60;0.01). The xenograft animal model confirmed our <i>in vitro<\/i> findings wherein the combined treatment exerted more potent anti-tumor activity (p&#60;0.05). We also observed that silencing of p53 promoted resistance towards the MDM2 antagonist and did not induce apoptosis, highlighting that a functional p53 is required for inducing apoptosis after combined treatment. Furthermore, we observed that the combined treatment promoted ROS induced oxidative stress (p&#60;0.01) and promoted DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of H2AX (p&#60;0.01), highlighting its potential as an effective therapeutic strategy.<br \/>Conclusion: We provide novel pre-clinical evidence that inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling can augment the anti-tumor activity of an MDM2 antagonist in p53-mutant human tumor models of ESCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5849ee14-69bb-4a06-85e9-4f7ed0a88ec4\/@A03B8ZKx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,MDM2,p38 MAP kinases,p53 mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14222"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Souvick Roy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachana Garg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Goel<\/i><\/presenter>.

The complex relationship of obesity to breast cancer growth and aggressiveness must continue to be examined. Within breast adipose tissue, obesity causes a state of chronic, macrophage-driven inflammation. Chronic inflammation is associated with increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Increased collagen within the mammary microenvironment is a risk factor for tumor formation, as well as more aggressive tumors, in mouse models. In breast tumors from obese patients, tumor desmoplasia is also found to be increased. To better understand how obesity affects mammary tumor growth, inflammation, and fibrosis, we used a diet-induced obesity mouse model paired with the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;)+ TC2 mammary tumor cell line in female FVB mice. We observed that TC2 mammary tumors grew significantly faster in obese mice compared to lean mice and had significantly more macrophage infiltration. TC2 tumors from obese mice also had significantly more collagen deposition than TC2 tumors from lean mice, indicating that obesity leads to more fibrotic tumors. To identify how weight loss alters the mammary gland and mammary tumor microenvironments, obese mice were switched from a high-fat diet to a low-fat diet for six weeks, to induce weight loss. In non-tumor-bearing mammary glands, weight loss led to a significantly decreased number of crown-like structures, a marker of adipose tissue inflammation, similar to observations in human adipose tissue. TC2 mammary tumors grew at an intermediate rate between tumors from lean and obese mice, indicating that weight loss may be a viable option to reduce tumor aggressiveness, particularly for obese patients with other breast cancer risk factors. Understanding these weight-related changes in the mammary gland and mammary tumor microenvironments will provide greater insight into possible interventions for obese breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/12813faa-8894-4474-9e39-955b5f86facf\/@A03B8ZKx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mammary gland,Macrophages,Collagen,Obesity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14231"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Genevra M.

Herein, we report associations between vitamin D serum biomarkers collected at cohort entry up to 15 years prior to CRC onset and CRC tumor subtypes defined by high expression of tumor markers (Ki67, p53, and COX2) that represent cellular processes (proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation) affected by vitamin D. Importantly, higher expression of these markers reflects greater risk for metastasis and CRC-specific mortality.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Data arise from the Southern Community Cohort Study, a cohort from the southeastern United States where the majority of participants are AA. Incident CRC cases with tumor sample were analyzed (n=104). Expression of cellular Ki67, p53, and COX2 (% positivity) were measured and categorized by literature-defined high vs. low cut-points (20%, 10%, and 20%, respectively). Logistic models adjusted for age, race, and sex were used to measure associations between vitamin D biomarkers: 25-hydroxyvitaminD, vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), and calculated free 25-hydroxyvitaminD (vitamin D not bound by VDBP) and the odds of a more aggressive tumor subtype, defined by higher cellular expression. Associations were assessed in the full sample and the subsample of AAs (n=70).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>There were 52 tumors with high Ki67 expression, 37 with high p53, and 50 with high COX2. Fifteen tumors had high expression of all three markers. Cases were 55.8&#177;0.4 (mean&#177;SE) years at enrollment (range 40-79). The median 25-hydroxyvitaminD was lower in cases with high p53 expressing tumors compared to low expression (13.5 vs. 18.0 ng\/mL, respectively, p = .03). Median values for other biomarkers were similar by tumor subtype (p &#38;gt .05). 25-hydroxyvitaminD was not associated with having a tumor with high Ki67 expression (odds ratio (OR) per 1 SD increase [95% CI] = 1.29 [0.85-1.95], p-trend = .23), high p53 expression (0.80 [0.52-1.23], p-trend = .30), or high COX2 expression (1.29 [0.83-2.00], p = .25). We observed null associations for VDBP, and free 25-hydroxyvitaminD with all tumor subtypes. Results were similar in AAs, although higher VDBP was associated with lower odds of high Ki67 tumors (0.45 [0.21-0.97], p-trend = .04 per 1 SD increase).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In this sample of predominantly AA CRC cases, we observed no association between vitamin D biomarkers in stored serum and subsequent more aggressive CRC molecular subtypes. More work is needed to characterize the relationship between vitamin D and expression of CRC tumor markers, which may help clarify the protective role of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in association with CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0b72661c-95f4-477e-ad67-3276faee091c\/@A03B8ZKx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vitamin D,Colorectal cancer,Molecular epidemiology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14232"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thomas Lawler<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiuyin Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Steinwandel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William J.

A significant percentage of pediatric patients consume diets high in fat and sugar content. These macronutrients modulate oxidative stress yet their impact on AML treatment is unexplored. Studies have implicated a role for BMAL1 rhythmicity, a circadian clock protein, in leukemogenesis. However, BMAL1 has not been studied in FLT3 mutant AML. Given that both nutrition and circadian rhythmicity can be modulated by behavior, we hypothesized that modulating redox and BMAL1 status through diet composition and timing would enhance treatment efficacy in an orthotopic mouse model.<br \/>In all <i>in vivo <\/i>experiments, mice were injected via tail vein with 100,000 MOLM13 luciferase labelled cells, a FLT3 AML human cell line. After engraftment was confirmed 3 days later, mice were put on diet modification regimens. In three subsequent experiments, distinct diet interventions were delivered: low fat (30%)\/low sucrose (10%), low sucrose alone (10%), or an isocaloric time feeding regimen (TRF) restricted to mice&#8217;s active phase (7 PM to 7 AM). Standard chow, high sucrose diet (45%) and ad libitum feeding were controls, respectively. In each experiment, doxorubicin (2 mg\/kg) or PBS was injected twice weekly via tail vein. Tumor burden was monitored via bioluminescent imaging. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed with flow cytometry, and changes in circadian, redox, and apoptotic protein expression were measured by western blot and mass cytometry.<br \/>On day 17, in the presence of doxorubicin, mice on a low fat\/low sucrose diet showed significantly lower tumor burden compared to control. Doxorubicin induced oxidative stress was reduced in the mice fed the modified diet as demonstrated by a decrease in ROS levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Even in the absence of doxorubicin treatment, the modified diet group showed significantly lower tumor burden on day 17. For mice on a low sucrose diet, changes in redox and circadian protein expression were observed on day 17. Of note, total BMAL1 protein showed a two-fold increase in spleen from the low sucrose group. In the timed feeding experiments, we observed TRF mice had significantly reduced leukemic burden on day 14. Importantly, doxorubicin efficacy was not compromised by TRF. In addition, a significant increase in total BMAL1 protein expression was observed in liver from these TRF mice on day 14.<br \/>These results point to a novel finding: diet composition and timing slows progression of FLT3 AML growth in vivo and<i> <\/i>are accompanied by<i> <\/i>BMAL1 modulation. In future studies, we aim to further define the role of circadian rhythmicity and diet composition in AML progression and identify methods to complement treatment to positively impact survival outcomes for patients diagnosed with AML.<i> <\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/74fc1bc9-9b37-4b3a-8c6d-36a963385360\/@B03B8ZKy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Circadian rhythm,Chemotherapy response,Diet,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14233"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Megan Rodriguez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Figueroa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brianna Murphy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiewei Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baharan Fekry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kendra Allton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Barton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Konopleva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Mahan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joya Chandra<\/i><\/presenter>.
