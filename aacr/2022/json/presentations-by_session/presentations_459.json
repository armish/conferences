[{"Abstract":"Oxidative stress is exerted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate due to an imbalance between ROS generation and elimination, which impacts cellular metabolism and consequently tumorigenesis in the tumor microenvironment. Recently, our group has developed a spinal cord glioma (SCG) model in G&#246;ttingen minipigs. However, the mechanism of how SCGs balance redox and thereby modulate cellular proliferation is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the NRF2\/NQO1 signaling, known to mediate oxidative stress, is upregulated in unresectable SCG cells infiltrating at the leading edge compared with the core cells. Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and IL-6, were significantly elevated in the edge SCG cells. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive staining for a higher Ki-67 proliferative index, GFAP, SOX2 and Olig2 in the edge cells compared to the core cells. The oxidative metabolic heterogeneity of immune and stromal cell subtypes among tumor samples was also explored. Hence, our study demonstrated the tumor microenvironment and involvement of the NRF2\/NQO1 pathway for redox homeostasis in our minipig SCG model, which can be used to explore targets of the pre-clinical treatment investigations in SCG.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec67a7b5-d240-4fe9-9fdc-ba5da80a7691\/@y03B8ZMn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oxidative stress,Tumor microenvironment,Animal models,Glioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14382"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kecheng Lei<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Muhibullah S.

Although isolation of viable malignant cells from these fluids for drug screening and other experimental purposes have been described in the literature, the success rate in obtaining pure cultures is low and the technique is rarely employed in the clinical setting. Here, we present the results of the implementation in our hospital of routine primary culture and subsequent drug testing from pleural effusions and ascites.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: 22 pleural effusions (PE) and 11 ascitic fluid from 33 p. were collected; three colon, one esophagous, one melanoma, eight ovarian, one pancreatic and 19 lung cancer. Total cells were isolated by centrifugation, erythrocytes discarded by density gradient and the remaining cells cultured in RPMI + 20%FBS. Primary cultures were genotyped by next generation sequencing (NGS), FISH, qPCR and nCounter. The antitumor effects of several drugs were tested by MTT, including tyrosine kinase, PARP and KRAS inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents such as cis-platinum or pemetrexed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Primary cultures were attempted from 33 malignant pleural effusions and ascites samples. Cells grew &#8805;3 passages and were genotyped in 28\/33 cases (84%). Eleven primary cultures were pan-negative by NGS, suggesting that they derived either from non-tumor cells or from a minor sub-clone within the tumor. In contrast, 17 primary cultures showed alterations in oncogenes or tumor supressor genes, allelic fractions were &#8805;70% in 11 cases. Synchronous liquid biopsies or FFPE biopsies were available for the 17 primary cultures; the same genetic alterations were present in all cases. Five primary cultures with drivers at &#8805;70% allelic fraction (<i>KRAS<\/i> G12C; <i>ALK<\/i> and <i>ROS1<\/i> fusions; <i>MET<\/i> and <i>FGFR1<\/i> amplifications) were used for MTT assays.

In follow-on experiments, a progressive increase in cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in mutant but not WT iMSC, which became more pronounced in mutant iOB and correlated with a transformed phenotype. We are currently evaluating the temporal kinetics of this process, including through the use of low-coverage whole genome sequencing to elucidate the existence of recurrent patterns. These data highlight the utility of our iPSC approach as a novel model of OS, allowing for the first time the ability to study the evolution of genome instability in real time.&nbsp; We envision that this approach may uncover heretofore undiscovered common patterns underlying the seemingly chaotic nature of OS genomes, providing new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,CRISPR\/Cas9,Genomic instability,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14384"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kelsie Lynn Becklin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Madden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Mills<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Thue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Carroll<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony DeFeo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Branden Moriarity<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beau Webber<\/i><\/presenter>.

Characterizing their respective genomic landscapes can expand the knowledge base of comparative oncology and support biomarker discovery and therapeutic development for the benefit of both species. Genomic profiling via tumor biopsy infers risk to the patient in both human and veterinary medicine and is often complicated by tumor heterogeneity. Blood-based liquid biopsy has been shown to open new opportunities to profile the cancer genome noninvasively in both species. The goal of this study was to benchmark the occurrence of homologous genomic variants in a variety of canine cancers that have a counterpart in humans, including lymphoma (B-cell and T-cell), soft-tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and melanoma, among others, utilizing tumor and liquid biopsy profiling. The study was performed in a prospective cohort of over 300 client-owned dogs that received a confirmed cancer diagnosis either at the time of enrollment or after sample collection. A blood sample was collected prior to biopsy or surgical resection of the tumor to evaluate the use of liquid biopsy to noninvasively profile the cancer genome. Tumor tissue samples were collected at the time of surgical resection. In a subset of the subjects, blood samples were collected 3 to 30 days following surgical removal of the tumor, and longitudinally during cancer therapy and monitoring. The Cancer Gene Census (CGC) and COSMIC databases were interrogated, and a high degree of homology (&#62;90%) between human and canine oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes was observed. A custom panel was designed encompassing 95 of the top 100 human DNA single nucleotide variants from COSMIC that had a canine orthologue, and targeted sequencing was performed on all tissue and blood samples. A large number of these variants&#8212;many of which are actionable in human cancer&#8212; were detected in the tumor samples and pre-surgical plasma samples. In some patients, tumor-derived variants were detected in the post-surgical plasma that confirmed the presence of residual disease after surgery. As disease progressed, an increase in the variant allele fraction (VAF) of the tumor-derived mutations was observed and tracked with the patient&#8217;s clinical course. Additionally, the presence of variants that may be targetable by human cancer drugs were identified in a subset of patients. These findings demonstrate the potential of liquid biopsy to characterize the genomic landscape of canine cancers at diagnosis and throughout treatment, similar to observations reported in human cancers. This builds the foundation for comparative oncology to translate the knowledge of precision medicine between humans and dogs, to facilitate biomarker discovery, and to track emergence of potential actionable biomarkers in various therapeutic contexts to the benefit of both species.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/926d978f-fc1b-44fa-9c22-64f970928f22\/@y03B8ZMn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cancer genomics,Circulating tumor DNA,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14385"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ilya Chorny<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristina M.

Despite recent advances molecularly stratified therapy is lacking, in part due to the challenge of targeting the preponderance of tumor suppressors. Recent efforts to select therapy from our group have focused on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4\/6 (CDK4\/6) however the molecular determinants of response to therapy are unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we have undertaken high-throughput screening of exome sequenced primary mesothelioma cell lines alongside haploid cell lines harboring CRISPR knockouts of key, positively selected drivers BAP1, NF2 and MTAP. This strategy should enable us to identify robust and repeated drug-gene interactions using ensemble machine learning methods across a drug panel of drugs, both novel and in the clinic. Our platform encompasses multiple cross validation with both primary mesothelioma explants and clinical trial drug-response data. Patients were consented for extended pleurectomy decortication (EPD) and tissue sampled, disaggregated and cultured for no more than four passages to establish cell lines. Immunophenotyping and whole exome sequencing was conducted to validate their mesothelioma origins across an initial panel of 20 cell lines comprising primary cell lines established at the NKI (Netherlands) and Cardiff University (United Kingdom). To further characterize these, we investigated the response of the cell lines to 58 clinically approved cancer drugs using Imagen&#8217;s 3-day PredictRx assay. In addition, cell lines were treated with PARP inhibitors, olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib and talazoparib and incubated for 7 days. Cell count and cell death endpoints were captured in addition to phospho-H2AX immunofluorescence. Mesothelioma patient cells displayed differential sensitivity to targeted and non-targeted drugs. There were more nuanced responses amongst the targeted drugs, where for example epithelioid subtypes showed a greater sensitivity to mTOR, VEGFR and HDAC inhibitors in the 3-day assay. Compared with wild type cells, the haploid knockout cells were broadly 3-fold more sensitive to PARP inhibitors; mesothelioma primary cell lines showed exquisite sensitivity to talazoparib (IC50 &#60; 0.1 &#181;M). Multiple cross validation of our results across exome sequenced primary mesothelioma explants and patient tumors (PARP Phase II) is ongoing (data to be presented), leveraging machine learning based prediction of sensitivity, to be further validated in an upcoming PARP randomized trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2bc4d034-e39d-4282-81ca-312f070770ed\/@y03B8ZMn\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelioma,PARP inhibitors,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14386"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Gareth J.

Given both plexiform neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) arise within the Schwann cell lineage, we developed a drug discovery pipeline to identify targeted therapeutics for treating NF1-related neoplasia. Using CRISPR\/Cas9, immortalized human Schwann cell lines were created lacking the <i>NF1<\/i> gene or <i>NF1 <\/i>and components of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), such as <i>SUZ12. <\/i>~80% of all MPNST harbor loss of function mutations in PRC2 genes, which is highly suggestive that perturbation of epigenetic homeostasis plays a role in malignant transformation of neurofibromas.<br \/>Our models mimic the genetics of MPNSTs and allowed us to identify selectively lethal drugs which exploit vulnerabilities specific to these genetic drivers. We describe the identification of these novel drugs, extensive <i>in vivo <\/i>testing in models of MPNST, and mechanistic studies to explain <i>why <\/i>they act specifically on MPNSTs.<br \/>We identified compounds showing selective lethality towards <i>NF1<\/i>\/<i>SUZ12 <\/i>double mutant cells. These include drugs affecting epigenetic homeostasis, such as HDAC inhibitors (HDACi). Moreover, many of these drugs showed strong synergy when tested in combination with a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) against <i>NF1\/SUZ12 <\/i>deficient human Schwann and MPNST cell lines. We investigated the mechanism of this synergy using genetics, transcriptome, and proteome analysis. Interestingly, these mechanistic studies revealed possible emerging avenues of resistance the cells are utilizing to compensate for and survive therapeutic intervention. For instance, proteomics analysis of PRC2 deficient MPNST cell lines treated with combination therapy of MEKi and HDACi indicates activation of specific survival and stress response pathways. Targeting these pathways in conjunction with the therapeutics we have identified could prevent emergence of resistance and tumor escape.<br \/>Clinically interesting drug candidates were advanced and tested as single agents and in combination in multiple <i>in vivo <\/i>models of MPNST (including patient derived and cell line xenografts). The FDA approved drugs vorinostat (HDACi) and selumetinib (MEKi) have shown dramatic efficacy, with combination therapy exhibiting strong synergy <i>in vivo<\/i>. This includes durable responses in survival studies and the ability to dramatically shrink established tumors, with treated tumors showing markers of apoptosis.<br \/>The discovery of novel agents effective against several models of MPNST is exciting as there are currently no approved targeted therapies for MPNSTs. Our results implicate targeting of epigenetic homeostasis, in combination with MEKi, as a major vulnerability of MPNSTs deficient for PRC2 activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8af44051-5dc0-4efa-b9f7-6e9df581b1aa\/@q03B8ZMo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MEK inhibitor,HDAC inhibitor,Synthetic lethality,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14387"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyle B.

Subsequent loss of the remaining wild-type <i>NF1<\/i> allele in Schwann lineage cells of the peripheral nervous system leads to complete functional loss of the encoded protein, neurofibromin. Schwann cells lacking neurofibromin exhibit hyperactive RAS signaling, and contribute to the formation of benign plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs). Through additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes <i>CDKN2A\/CDKN2B<\/i>, these PNFs may escape senescence and progress to atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of uncertain biological potential (ANNUBP). Furthermore, loss of function mutations in Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) have been strongly implicated in the progression of ANNUBPs to lethal malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Although these alterations have been associated with MPNST formation, their temporal dependence during Schwann cell development and contribution to malignant transformation using a human cell model has not been studied. We hypothesize that sequential loss of <i>NF1<\/i>, <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, and finally <i>SUZ12<\/i> in Schwann cells transforms them into MPNST, and this process is possible to study using a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model system. To test our hypothesis, we generated Schwann lineage cells from commercially available iPSCs. Cells were subjected to targeted mutations using CRISPR\/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins at different stages of development to mimic potential tumorigenesis. Our preliminary results show that multiple iPSC donor lines can reliably be differentiated to Neural Crest Cells (NCCs), and further to mature Schwann cells. We have edited multiple target loci at high levels (&#62;70%) throughout Schwann cell development. NCCs lacking neurofibromin showed an increase in proliferation and migration. While iPSC-derived Schwann cells (iSCs) lacking <i>NF1<\/i> and <i>CDKN2A<\/i> with or without <i>SUZ12<\/i> loss became senescent after several passages. These mutant iSCs were unable to form tumors when subcutaneously injected into the flank of NRG mice, while commonly utilized immortalized human Schwann cell lines lacking <i>NF1<\/i> were able to form large subcutaneous tumors. Further refinement of this induced-MPNST (iMPNST) model through targeting of <i>CDKN2B<\/i>, <i>ATRX<\/i>, or <i>TP53<\/i> may allow for better understanding of the order and timing at which these transforming mutations are sufficient to result in MPNST formation. Additionally, the application of single-cell RNA sequencing technology to this system could uncover potential heterogeneity that could harbor a clone primed for malignant transformation. This model could aid in uncovering novel genetic mutations and pathways which contribute to transformation of benign PNFs to MPNSTs, providing additional targets for future therapeutic intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,Cancer,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Ras,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14388"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Garrett M.

Although mice offer many advantages when conducting cancer research,unlike humans, Rb1 knockout mice do not develop OS, suggesting the urgent requirement foralternative disease models to understand how RB1 mutation leads to osteosarcomagenesis.Here, we generated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by reprogramming RBand healthy control fibroblasts and then created isogenic controls by correcting RB1 mutationusing CRISPR\/Cas9. Performing<i> in vitro<\/i> soft-agar assay and<i> in vivo<\/i> xenografts, we foundpotential tumorigenic ability in RB osteoblasts (OBs) but not control OBs. In order to gain insightsinto RB1 loss associated osteosarcomagenesis, we compared global transcripts among RB andcontrol OBs. GSEA analysis indicated that OS associated genes are specifically enriched in RBOBs in comparison with control OBs, demonstrating that RB OBs acquire OS characteristics inthe absence of additional gene alterations. GO analysis revealed that genes involved in the mitoticcell cycle are enriched in RB OBs. Although RB1 is known to controlling G1\/S related geneexpression by inhibiting E2F transcription factors, it is still nebulous if RB1 plays a role inregulating mitotic genes.To comprehensively identify preferential binding of RB1 to specific promoters in OBs, weconducted RB1 ChIP-seq to map genome-wide RB1-binding sites in iPSC-derived OBs. SinceE2F3a, a RB1 repressed transcription factor, is enriched expressed in OBs, we also performedE2F3a ChIP-seq to define whether these RB1-repressed targets are E2F3a-activated targets.Using the nonbiased de novo motif search algorithm DME, we further identified the most highlyenriched RB1-binding motif in all conditions and cross-compare with the E2F3a motifs. Weconfirmed that RB1 and E2F3a co-occupy the mitotic regulator promoters by ChIP-PCR. IHCstudies of clinical OS specimens supported the clinical correlation between RB1\/E2F3a andmitotic regulators. High mitotic regulator genes expression is correlated with poor prognosis. Ourresults demonstrated that the mitotic regulators are co-regulated by both RB1 and E2F3a andthey play roles in osteosarcomagenesis.Taken together, our findings demonstrated multiple OS-related phenotypes in human RB iPSC-derived OBs and RB1\/E2F3a-regulating mitotic regulators can be a therapeutic vulnerability inRB1-mutant OS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9bdf532f-7806-414f-b181-a377ba89f39b\/@q03B8ZMo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Retinoblastoma protein,Osteosarcoma,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14390"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dandan Zhu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Tu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zijun Huo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>An Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mo-Fan Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Hung Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruiying Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dung-Fang Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

To expand our offerings of melanoma models beyond B16-F10, we have characterized two syngeneic melanoma models - Cloudman S91 and YUMM1.7, for preclinical oncology studies. Our <i>in vivo<\/i> (immune-oncology and radiation) and <i>in vitro<\/i> (flow cytometry) analyses establishes that Cloudman S91 is a more responsive model compared to YUMM1.7. The two models were evaluated for their responses to immune modulatory agents and focal radiation. Single agent treatment of established Cloudman S91 tumors with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) anti-mPD-1 and anti-mPD-L1 resulted in 116% and 41% increase in time to progression (%ITP) respectively. Treatment with anti-mCTLA-4, on the other hand, resulted in over 283% ITP with 20% tumor free survivors (TFS). Contrastingly, YUMM1.7 had no response to checkpoint blockade. These results indicate Cloudman S91 as a more responsive model to checkpoint blockade compared to YUMM1.7. Both models were found to be sensitive to focal beam radiation (RT) delivered using the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP; Xstrahl) resulting in dose dependent tumor growth delay in both models. In order to determine if the addition of CPI to RT could improve the outcome, we tested anti-mPD1 in combination with RT at 5Gy. Both models had improved response to combination treatment, with YUMM1.7 showing a 43% ITP and the Cloudman with &#62;350% ITP over untreated controls and 15% and 170% over RT single treatment. Analysis of untreated tumors by flow cytometry shows that both tumor models have a large myeloid population and relatively low lymphoid infiltrate. Changes in immune profiles upon treatment with anti-mPD1 and RT or in combination were further analyzed. Notably, RT treatment alone increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and decreased the M2 macrophage infiltration to the tumors resulting in a less immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In the combination groups, this microenvironment enhances the response to immunotherapy as seen in the improvement in activity compared to RT alone. Here we demonstrate the varying responses within the same histotype to similar treatments to help in drug discovery programs. Combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy offers benefits of modulating immune cells and enhancing the local and potentially abscopal effects of immunotherapy in both the Cloudman S91 and YUMM1.7 melanoma models. These characterizations can be useful in guiding model selection of murine melanoma and can inform rational combination treatment approaches for data driving decisions in drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/93fe2ac4-bf1c-4ea8-a4a0-723e67dd7398\/@q03B8ZMo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Solid tumors,Radiation therapy,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14391"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sumithra Urs<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derrik Germain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Nelson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Kucharczyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Draper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheri Barnes<\/i><\/presenter>.

In general, these cancers are effectively treated with adjuvant endocrine therapies, with or without the addition of CDK4\/6 inhibitors. However, many patients develop resistance and eventually progress to metastatic disease (MBC). Acquired mutations in ESR1, which encodes estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;), contribute to 20-40% of endocrine therapy resistant MBC. In patients, breast cancer metastasis occurs in the liver, lungs, brain and bone. OP-1250 is a novel compound that is a complete ER&#945; antagonist (CERAN). Previous studies have shown that OP-1250 effectively blocks both the AF-1 and AF-2 activation functions of ER&#945;. In the current study, we used a mutant ER&#945; MBC endocrine therapy resistant xenograft model to examine the efficacy of OP-1250 in a metastatic context. MCF7 cells engineered to express one of the most common and aggressive ER&#945; mutations, Y537S, were labeled with luciferase and injected via the nipple (mammary intraductal MIND model) into NSG mice. Mice were treated with 3 and 10 mg\/kg of OP-1250 alone or in combination with palbociclib at 70mg\/kg and tumor growth was monitored via a Xenogen IVIS imager. At study end point, mice were sacrificed and excised organs were imaged ex-vivo and further processed for immunohistology analysis. OP-1250 at both doses inhibited primary tumor growth as well as metastasis to the lung, liver, brain and bone, with greater effect at 10 mg\/kg, and was significantly more effective than Faslodex. When combined with palbociclib at 70 mg\/kg, an additional significant decrease in metastasis was observed, compared to OP-1250 or palbociclib alone. Our results also suggest that the efficacy seen in the combination study was driven primarily by OP-1250. In total, these results demonstrate the potential use of OP-1250, both alone and in combination with a CDK4\/6 inhibitor, to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in a model of aggressive mutant ER+ MBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4321ad96-ac2e-4030-b6dd-0d2627dcae59\/@q03B8ZMo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,,Metastasis,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14392"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Muriel Laine<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianne E.

CHIP has been associated with an increased risk of hematologic cancers, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. We hypothesized that somatic mutations in specific genes associated with human CHIP would be detectable in the blood of aged dogs not known to have hematologic disorders.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> DNA from paired germline and whole blood samples from 93 geriatric canine patients affected by solid cancer were subjected to targeted next generation sequencing. Impact of the variants was predicted using Polymorphism Phenotyping version 2 software (PolyPhen-2, Harvard). Clinical and demographic data were extracted from medical records.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Somatic variants were detected in peripheral blood of four (4.3 %) female dogs aged 12-15 years. Affected genes were <i>ASXL1, KIT, SF3B1, TET2, RUNX1<\/i>, and <i>PPM1D<\/i>. The variant in <i>PPM1D<\/i> was a nonsense mutation, while the other five variants were single nucleotide non-synonymous variants in protein coding regions of the genes. Following analysis by PolyPhen-2, the single nucleotide variants in <i>KIT<\/i> and <i>SF3B1<\/i> were predicted to be benign, while the variants in <i>ASXL1, TET2,<\/i> and <i>RUNX1<\/i> were predicted to be damaging. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> These results support the presence of variants in CHIP-associated genes in geriatric canids at a frequency similar to that observed in people, and the dog represents the first species in which the genetic lesion of CHIP has been documented.

Still, there is a need for well-characterized preclinical mouse models, as clinical data indicates that patients only partially respond to immune modulatory regiments. When compared to the classical subcutaneous or subQperior<sup>TM<\/sup> (implantation into the mammary fat pad) syngeneic mouse models, orthotopic models are considered more predictive, since implantation of tumor cells into the organ of origin allows organotypical interaction between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma, including immune cells.<br \/>Up until now, our standard procedure for an orthotopic Hepa1-6 liver model is the injection of Hepa1-6 cells into the spleen with the subsequent migration of the injected Hepa1 6 cells into the liver for five minutes via Vena lienalis. A major drawback of this method for a syngeneic model in immune-competent mice is the following resection of the spleen, a prominent secondary lymphoid organ. Therefore, we tested two other implantation methods: the direct injection of Hepa1-6 cells into a liver lobe using Matrigel<sup>TM<\/sup> and the injection of Hepa1-6 cells into the portal vein. In contrast to the standard procedure, both new test methods have in common an excessive bleeding potential which must be prevented.<br \/>As the Hepa1-6 cells are transduced with luciferase, their growth can be monitored in vivo by bioluminescence imaging and the growth characteristics will be compared. In addition to the growth, the composition of the immune populations will be analyzed staining with the all-in-one flow cytometry panel which permits the differentiation of the main immune cell populations in the tumor, such as T cells (CD4+, CD8+, Treg), B and NK cells, macrophages (M1\/M2), MDSCs (granulocytic and monocytic), and dendritic cells. The data will help to select the most suitable method for testing new drug candidates in an orthotopic liver tumor environment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6e85cbb3-508f-47e9-8673-4c92f53b17a7\/@q03B8ZMo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,syngeneic,Orthotopic models,Flow cytometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14395"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Cynthia Obodozie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Moor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gojko Bijelic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Muriel Malaisé<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Metzger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Holger Weber<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In contrast to CDKs which promote cell cycle progression, CDK12 is a transcriptional regulator of various cellular functions, most importantly cellular response to DNA damage and stress. Genomic alterations in CDK12 have been detected in up to 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Phosphoproteomic studies have revealed that Protein Kinase D1 (PrKD1), another member of the serine\/threonine kinase family, is the only kinase known to phosphorylate CDK12 at serine 681 (s681) and serine 685 (s685). While there is an increasing body of literature on CDK12 downstream signaling, there is almost no published data on upstream effectors or regulation of CDK12. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated CDK12 s681a and s681a+s685 mutants and transfected them into stable C4-2 and C4-2-PrKD1 cell lines to evaluate the interaction between CDK12 and PrKD1. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting revealed that endogenous CDK12 is stable in C4-2 cells with known levels of PrKD1 expression. However, stable transfection of C4-2-PrKD1 cells with wild-type CDK12 resulted in the degradation of nascent CDK12, whereas the non-phosphorylated mutants (s681 and s681+s685) remained stable. Our results suggest that PrKD1-mediated phosphorylation of s681and\/or s685 residues affect CDK12 stability in C4-2-PrKD1 cells. We confirmed this finding by treating C4-2-PrKD1 cells with MG-132, a 26 S proteasome inhibitor, and repeating the experiment. Proteasomal inhibition rescued nascent transfected CDK12 levels even after PrKD1 phosphorylation. Our study demonstrates that CDK12 degradation might be mediated by PrKD1 phosphorylation at s681 and\/or s685. Because PrKD1 and CKD12 are dysregulated across cancers, the results herein presented have potential implications for the treatment of not only prostate cancer but also other human malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/14012c82-7995-4a8d-8483-4d61f6e9f3c8\/@q03B8ZMo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate tumor,CDK,Cell lines,Proteasome inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14396"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Victor Chalfant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Riveros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sanjeev Shukla<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teruko Osumi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>K Balaji<\/i><\/presenter>.

To prepare a metastatic niche, a tight network must be present to coordinate the delivery and sharing of co-stimulatory signals among malignant tumor epithelial cells and supportive host cells. AXL and STAT3 cascades are critical components of intracellular signaling networks, as they translate multiple external stimuli into specific cellular responses. Single cell profiling of lung tumors reveals that AXL collaborates with STAT3 to create a unified tumor ecosystem favoring hybrid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition states of lung epithelial cells, pro-tumorigenic remodeling of fibroblasts and M2 polarization of macrophages. Disruption of AXL-STAT3 circuit with AXL inhibitor and JAK inhibitor not only compromises this co-dependency in A549 lung cancer cells implanted in xenograft mice, but also limits their ability to conscript murine fibroblasts, macrophages and other immune cells that form a symbiotic community for tumor growth. Our preclinical work suggests that combined targeting of AXL-STAT3 circuit could disturb the communication among diverse cell subtypes in the lung tumor microenvironment, thus limiting the metastatic progression. Our co-culture studies reveal that AXL signaling in lung cancer cells and fibroblasts exerts an IL-11 mediated paracrine effect on macrophages to sustain STAT3 signaling for M2 polarization and cancer stemness mimicry. <i>In vivo<\/i> drug testing in A549 mouse xenograft model demonstrate that AXL-STAT3 inhibition leads to reduction in host cell recruitment and attenuates M2 polarization of macrophages and pro-tumorigenic remodeling of stromal fibroblasts. AXL-STAT3 targeting to dismantle lung tumor microenvironments is a promising therapeutic strategy and may establish new treatment paradigms for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/da875984-aec3-4e6f-9e1c-82350397a7d0\/@q03B8ZMo\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Axl,STAT3,Lung adenocarcinoma,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14397"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Josephine Amalia Taverna<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Nung Hung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meizhen Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joel Michalek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chun-Liang Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nameer Kirma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Wei Chou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xi Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiou-Miin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhang Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Duy Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel DeArmond<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our aim was to validate an <i>in vitro<\/i> immune cell killing assay where activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) target lung cancer cells and induce apoptosis.<br \/>A549 human lung carcinoma cells (ATCC) were used as target cells in the co-culture and were plated into 96-well plates. 24 hours later, human PBMCs (Lonza) were added to the culture as effector cells and activated with anti-CD3 and IL2. Apoptosis was detected using IncuCyte Annexin V reagent, which was added to the cells at the same time with immune cell activators. Cell proliferation was monitored with a live cell imager IncuCyte S3 (Sartorius) for three to four days before terminating the cultures. Cell viability was determined by CellTiter Glo (Promega) at the end of the study.<br \/>Treatment of cells with anti-CD3 was able to activate immune cells alone but the effects were observed with lower test concentrations in combination with IL-2. Therefore, IL-2 potentiates the effect of anti-CD3 on immune cell activation and decreases cancer cell viability in co-culture.<br \/>The immune cell killing assay based on live cell imaging can be used for studying the effects of immunomodulating agents on cancer cell viability and to evaluate the activity of immune cells in the presence of therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fbd2323b-ec2a-4815-a326-c0f2161a7c90\/@q03B8ZMo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Immune cells,A549,PBMC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14398"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jenni H.

Despite its key role, therapeutic targeting of c-Myc remains a challenge because of a disordered protein tertiary structure. The basic helical structure and zipper protein of c-Myc forms an obligate heterodimer with its partner MAX to function as a transcription factor. An attractive strategy is to inhibit MYC\/MAX dimerization to decrease c-Myc transcriptional function. Several methods have been described to inhibit MYC\/MAX dimerization including small molecular inhibitors and proteomimetics. We used NOD SCID gamma mice (NGS mice) that are immunodeficient, non-obese diabetic laboratory mice (Jackson Laboratories, Cat Number J000077451) carrying patient-derived xenograft (PDX) following implantation of grade IV adenocarcinoma of the prostate from a patient into the flanks of each mouse. For maximum tolerable dose studies, we used C57BL\/6 wild type mice (Jackson Laboratories, Cat Number J000664). We performed a maximum dose tolerability study with the drug 3JC48-3 up to 100 mg\/kg to determine limiting toxicity. We monitored the rate of growth for 2 weeks and measured the final volume of the tumors. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed using the prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, that were treated with the drug 3JC48-3 at different doses (0, 5, 10, and 20uM) for 24 hours and subsequently lysed. We found 3JC48-3 decreases prostate cancer growth and viability in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro. We confirmed the inhibition of MYC\/MAX dimerization by 3JC48-3 using immunoprecipitation experiments. Normal mice and mice with patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts (PDX) tolerated intraperitoneal injections of 3JC48-3 up to 100 mg\/kg body weight without dose-limiting toxicity. Preliminary results in these PDX mouse models suggest that 3JC48-3 may be effective in decreasing the rate of tumor growth. Our study demonstrates that 3JC48-3 is a potent MYC\/MAX heterodimerization inhibitor that decreases prostate cancer growth and viability in association with upregulation of both PrKD1 expression and kinase activity. In addition, 3JC48-3 is well tolerated in prostate cancer PDX mice models and may be a candidate drug for further preclinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/885c578c-010e-403f-8675-6d2ae6305bc2\/@r03B8ZMp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate tumor,Myc,Mouse models,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14399"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Carlos Riveros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Chalfant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sanjeev Shukla<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teruko Osumi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>KC Balaji<\/i><\/presenter>.

The mortality rate is the third among the top ten cancers. Among colorectal cancer patients, about 65-75% of patients have overexpression of epithelial growth factor receptors (EGFR). The antibody drug cetuximab that inhibits EGFR has also been developed. Moreover, overexpression of src protein is found in about 80% of patients with colorectal cancer. Higher levels of Src expression is related to the metastasis of colon cancer. Dasatinib is an oral taken tyrosine kinase inhibitor to inhibit the src phosphorylation. Therefore, in this study, the mechanism of cetuximab and dasatinib combined treatment in the orthotopic mouse model is investigated. The in vivo mechanism of EGFR and E-cadherin crosstalk in the mouse model is discussed. In this study, HT-29 colon cancer cells with BRAF V600E mutation were orthotopically injected into the cecum wall of BALB\/c nude male mice. Two weeks later, cetuximab, dasatinib, and combined treatment of cetuximab and dasatinib were applied for three weeks. The tumor sizes were then recorded after sacrificed. Tumor Tissue were processed for tissue section with H&#38;E staining. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was applied to detect EGFR, p-Src, E-cadherin with specific antibodies. The protein expression levels were achieved by Western blot. In the results, the tumor size was smaller in cetuximab and dasatinib combined treated group. In IHC staining, the E-cadherin expression were not apparent in primary tumor site, however, were abundant in migrated cells. P-src expression was reduced in the dasatinib treated group and combined treatment group. In western blot result, the E-cadherin was increased after the treatment of dasatinib, and the p-src expression was inhibited after dasatinib treatment and combined treatment. Our results demonstrated cetuximab combined with dasatinib has the better result of suppression of BRAF mutated colon cancer cell growth and metastasis in the orthotopic mouse model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b0fc964-9c34-460a-a637-3674dd5374f5\/@r03B8ZMp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Orthotopic models,EGFR,Src,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14400"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yu-Cheng Weng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Lin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang-Ling Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Min Koo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Wen Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Viriya Adhiguna Winarso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Wen Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei-Ting Chao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Multiple aspects of fatty acid metabolism, including fatty acid synthesis, are upregulated in white adipose tissue during obesity development. The enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a supportive player in fatty acid synthesis, is relied upon for metastasis of murine TNBC particularly in models of obesity- further elucidating the importance of fatty acid metabolism to breast cancer progression in those with obesity. Ferroptosis, a method of cell death induced by peroxidation of phospholipid fatty acyl chains, is a recently discovered and rapidly developing mechanistic target in multiple cancer types. While several cancers, including breast cancer, are sensitive to ferroptosis induced by different mechanisms, the metabolic vulnerabilities and consequent therapeutic potential of ferroptosis are just beginning to be explored. This study aims to determine whether obesity-driven reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism exacerbates breast cancer progression via altered sensitivity to ferroptosis<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>The relationship between obesity, breast cancer and lipid peroxidation was investigated in vitro via proliferation assays, qPCR, Western blot and flow cytometry using multiple murine models of breast cancer treated with erastin and RSL3. PC was suppressed using shRNA introduced via lentiviral transduction. In vivo tumor growth in lean and obese mice was determined following treatment with erastin, RSL3, or a vehicle control.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>In vitro data reveals that<b> <\/b>TNBC cells are highly sensitive to treatment with the ferroptosis-inducing molecules erastin and RSL3. Erastin treatment transcriptionally induces PC expression in several murine models of TNBC in vitro. Suppression of PC at baseline (without ferroptosis induction) is sufficient to induce transcription of glutathione peroxidase-4 (a critical regulator of ferroptosis). While Affymetrix array data of untreated metastatic M-Wnt<sup>Lung<\/sup> primary tumors showed a decrease in PC and associated genes in tumors from obese mice relative to lean mice, treatment with erastin increased PC expression specifically in tumors from obese mice. Tumors from obese mice relative to control mice have an altered response to treatment with the ferroptosis inducing molecules erastin and RSL3.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> These data indicate that obesity-associated dysregulation of lipid metabolism and regulation of PC may be key determinants of sensitivity to induction of ferroptosis. Future work will delineate the relationship between breast cancer, ferroptosis, and fatty acid metabolism utilizing in vivo models to determine whether ferroptosis-specific mechanisms are exacerbated with PC suppression to further impede obesity-exacerbated tumor growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/701aeca6-f13c-478e-87b9-5f8cb2ffdd51\/@r03B8ZMp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fatty acids,Obesity,Ferroptosis,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14401"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emily Devericks<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael F.

Our analysis revealed high degree of overlap between PDCL and their paired tumors and strong transcriptomic resemblance between type I and II tumors. Given the unexpected degree of similarities, we were intrigued to functionally interrogate representative shared canonical signaling pathways (Z&#62;2.5) (activation of Sirtuin, RhoGDI and PTEN) and (inhibition of IL-8 and NF-kB) and potential drivers (Z&#62;2.5) (including DNMT3B, NPAT, PDLIM2, FLCN, SIRT3, KRAS) between tumors and PDCL as potential therapeutic targets and interrogate their effectiveness between type I and II tumors. Based on drug availability, only three drug targets were identified: KDM1A, SIRT3, and PDLIM2 and, respectively, Seclidemstat, Resveratrol and Birabresib as potential inhibitors. To investigate the effect of these drugs, cell viability was determined. All predicted candidates resulted in tumor cell death; however, and while neither predicted nor suggested by our in-silico model, we observed a consistently higher <i>in vitro<\/i> anti-tumor activity of two of the drugs in type II versus type I derived PDCL. Specifically, Seclidemstat, had an ~6x increase while Birabresib an ~10x increase in achieving cell death.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We identified three novel targets \/ drug inhibitors using combined transcriptomic profiling and functional characterization of type I and II EndoCA. Intriguingly, while selected based on shared profiles, two of these targets\/drugs had markedly, and unexpectedly, greater effect in type II versus type I tumors. Interestingly, both of these drugs - Seclidemstat and Birabresib - are currently being tested in phase I clinical trials as novel epigenetic agents in solid tumors. Studies continue to explore the effectiveness of these agents in EndoCA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/428900d3-e939-418b-b18f-c28036d6d2b8\/@r03B8ZMp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-11 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,Cell lines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14403"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Deep S.

Acquired resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy or their combination contributes to a majority of relapse cases which suggests the need to develop models that can be used for preliminary screening of drugs or decipher the associated signaling mechanisms contributing to this resistance. Various chemo-resistant, as well as radio-resistant models, have been established as in vitro models. In cervical cancer treatment, often, radiation therapy is accompanied by the addition of radio-sensitizers such as cisplatin that increase its treatment efficiency. Hence, a combined chemo-radio-resistant <i>in vitro <\/i>model seems more relevant clinically in cervical cancer. Therefore, we designed our study to establish a cellular model that is resistant to a combined treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A chemo-radio resistant cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) was developed <i>in vitro <\/i>by a fractionated exposure of a combination of cisplatin and megavoltage X-rays. Briefly, HeLa cells were sensitized with cisplatin (0.1&#181;M increase at every fraction) prior to radiation exposure (2Gy). The cells were treated once in 5 days and eventually after 25 fractions, delivered in 20 weeks, the cells were made resistant up to a total dose of 2.5&#181;M cisplatin + 50Gy. These cells were further characterized and compared with radioresistant HeLa cells as well as parental cells. For this purpose, proliferation assay, clonogenic survival assay, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay were performed. The resistivity was confirmed by comet assay and Gamma-H2AX staining. Interestingly, an increase in cell proliferation and clonogenic survival rates was observed in chemo-radio-resistant cells. FACS analysis revealed that the proportion of cells in G2\/M phase increased and apoptotic rates declined in chemo-radio-resistant cells. Further, changes in comet tails, olive moment and Gamma-H2AX foci formation in chemo-radio-resistant groups confirmed resistivity. These cells were also analyzed for their metastatic properties and results suggest that induced chemo-radio-resistant cells are more tumorigenic as compared to only radioresistant cells as well as the parental ones. In conclusion, the establishment of a chemo-radio-resistant cell line may serve as a model to study signalling mechanisms, drug screening and develop novel drugs. Further studies are underway to induce the chemo-radio resistance in other cell lines by a similar method.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e93c57ba-5f76-491a-9cdc-e0e494837897\/@r03B8ZMp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cisplatin resistance,Radioresistance,Cervical cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14404"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanchita Khurana<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Surbhi Singla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reena Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhavana Rai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shalmoli Bhattacharyya<\/i><\/presenter>.

Treatment results shown in cell models used in studying various drugs often fail in clinical trials. The lack of translation of the effects observed <i>in vitro<\/i> to patients continues to halt progress. Genetic mutations are known in PDAC; however, recent studies have suggested the role of epigenetics in its initiation and progression to a malignant phenotype. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins are highly expressed in a variety of cancers, including pancreatic cancer. Recent studies have shown that targeting these proteins through the use of HDAC inhibitors may be an effective therapy for pancreatic cancer. Using a 3D cultured pancreatic cell model, anti-cancer effects by vorinostat, a HDAC inhibitor, were investigated. Although both pancreatic cell lines, PANC-1 and Mia, contain mutated K-ras and P53, a differential effect in response to vorinostat was observed in expression of cancer genes using a Human Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma TagMan Array 96 (Applied Biosystems). In the PANC-1 cell model, vorinostat decreased expression of <i>STAT6<\/i>, which is known to play a role in migration and invasion. It also decreased significantly expression of <i>insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1), IL-6, EGF, VEGFA and TGFB1. CCND2 <\/i>and<i> CCND2<\/i> were also downregulated. In contrast, Mia cell model showed decreased expression of <i>EGF <\/i>and<i> IGF1<\/i>, but no change with the other genes. These data suggest that vorinostat has effects on several potential pathways in pancreatic cancer possibly through epigenetic mechanisms that affect certain genes involved in progression and invasion. Currently, this drug in combination with other drugs is being investigated for pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd2c0dd6-cc23-4dc0-996d-640111ed539f\/@s03B8ZMq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,HDAC inhibitor,Epigenetics,Spheroids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14405"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Fatemeh Nouri Emamzaden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beverly Word<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Hammons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Beverly D.

Similar to human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), this cell line carries a KRAS mutation making an attractive model for drug discovery\/oncology research applications. NSCLC tumors grow slower and less aggressively than small cell lung cancers, yet the 5-year survival rate for NSCLC is 25%. Thus, more relevant preclinical models are still needed to evaluate the potential therapeutic activities of agents that can be used in the clinic. Orthotopic implantation of luciferase-labeled cancer cell lines facilitate the evaluation of disease progression using bioluminescence <i>in vivo<\/i> imaging. Here we report the development of a novel model of orthotopically implanted Luciferase-labeled A549-luc cells, its tumor growth kinetics and response to standard of care therapy. To establish the orthotopic model, we implanted cells by direct injection into the left lung lobe through a small incision on the lateral thorax between the 6<sup>th<\/sup> and 7<sup>th<\/sup> rib. Disease progression was evaluated by testing cell implants at multiple cell inoculums and following each group for tumor growth using an IVIS Spectrum CT. In line with the observed slow growth of NSCLC, A549 tumor growth kinetics revealed long latency with a median survival of 69.5-days post-implant. Mean flux values correlated with the number of cells inoculated and clinical observations of respiratory distress. Gross necropsies provided visual evidence of masses in the left lung lobe and thoracic cavity. Following the A549-luc orthotopic model development, we sought to evaluate the survival benefit in response to standard of care agents Paclitaxel and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors Erlotinib and Afatinib. Paclitaxel monotherapy was the most active agent in a 101-day study. A single treatment cycle showed robust decrease tumor burden as determined via imaging during the first few weeks following treatment, but disease progression was apparent despite the overall improved survival over the vehicle control group. To establish durable responses, we evaluated the efficacy of Paclitaxel administered for two dosing cycles. Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4\/6 inhibitor that has been recently identified as potential target in KRAS-mutant (NSCLC) was also evaluated. Our preliminary results show significant activity for both Palbociclib and Paclitaxel therapies in the A549-luc lung orthotopic xenograft model. This lung orthotopic model provides a sensible alternative that recapitulates the difficulties of treating NCSL tumors in addition to establishing a more clinically relevant model to evaluate cancer therapies compared to standard subcutaneous implanted models. Histopathological analysis of Ki67, Cyclin D1, and CDK4 will be presented from lungs of treated and control groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7c42217f-cbc6-4b14-80d4-65628c645047\/@s03B8ZMq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Imaging,Palbociclib,Paclitaxel,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14406"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth Rainbolt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chassidy Hall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Wood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paula L.

Novel approaches are helping to identify new combination treatment strategies for therapeutic intervention of bladder cancer, which is the thirteenth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Using anti-mPD-1 treatment in a murine bladder cancer model MB49, we show that non-targeted immune gene expression profiling combined with flow cytometry provides a gene and cell-specific signature for the tumor microenvironment, which aids in the identification of targets for novel treatment approaches.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>C57BL\/6 mice with established MB49 tumors were treated with anti-mPD-1 or isotype control antibodies. Tumors were collected 3 days after the last treatment. Treatment-induced immunophenotypic changes were examined in tumor-infiltrating immune subsets using T cell- and myeloid-focused flow cytometry panels. We used the mouse PanCancer IO 360&#8482; Nanostring panel for transcriptomic analysis of 770 genes and the ROSALIND&#8482; platform (OnRamp BioInformatics) to identify differentially regulated genes between treatment groups.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Treatment of tumors with anti-mPD-1 showed moderate anti-tumor activity, with a 58% tumor growth inhibition at day 18 post-implant. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed that anti-mPD-1 triggered an increase in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells compared to control animals. Additionally, the CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell phenotype was altered by treatment, with increased frequency of ICOS and LAG-3 in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in tumors from treated animals. Changes in the T cell compartment also included reduction in the proportion of central memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells compared to controls. In the myeloid compartment, iNOS expression increased in tumor-associated macrophages from treated animals. NanoString analysis revealed 62 genes were differentially regulated in tumors from treated animals compared to controls. ROSALIND analysis classified 30 of the genes as regulators of interferon, cytotoxicity, antigen presentation, and cytokine signaling. Among the genes upregulated by anti-mPD-1 were IDO, TIM-3, and CSFR1, which can promote tumor growth and are clinical targets being investigated for new immunotherapies.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>NanoString analysis complemented immunophenotyping to provide a comprehensive profile of the MB49 tumor model. Together, these data demonstrate that anti-mPD1 increases T cell recruitment into the tumor and upregulates the expression of genes known to enhance T cell recruitment and anti-tumor activity. iNOS protein upregulation suggests that anti-mPD-1 treatment may also exert effects by driving M2 macrophages towards an M1 phenotype.

The only intervention that has improved the survival rate of GBM patients over the past several decades has been combining temozolomide (TMZ) with radiotherapy (RT), which increased median survival by only ~2.5 months to where it currently stands at ~15 months. Unfortunately, all GBM patients eventually die due to tumor recurrence. Intrinsic or acquired resistance to TMZ is a significant contributing factor to tumor progression, and various mechanisms have been suggested, including deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes such as <i>MSH2<\/i>. Utilizing patient GBM samples from the TCGA, we have identified a correlation between low <i>MSH2 <\/i>expression and shorter patient survival. To test the biological significance of <i>Msh2<\/i> in GBM growth and resistance to TMZ and immunotherapy, we have generated immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of GBM with germline or somatic loss of<i> Msh2<\/i>. To generate tumors with reduced or abrogated <i>Msh2<\/i>, we utilized GEMMs based on the RCAS\/tv-a gene transfer system in combination with mice that exhibited heterozygous and homozygous loss of <i>Msh2<\/i>. When <i>PDGFB<\/i> was overexpressed in combination with the silencing of <i>Tp53<\/i> to induce tumors, tumor-bearing mice with reduced or deficient <i>Msh2<\/i> demonstrated shorter survival time compared to wild-type tumor-bearing mice. In addition, our results indicate <i>Msh2 <\/i>deficiency increases the malignancy of gliomas. Our data demonstrate that two weeks of TMZ treatment at a clinically relevant dose of 25 mg\/kg provides a significant survival advantage in WT-tumor-bearing mice, while no efficacy was observed in tumor-bearing mice with either heterozygous or homozygous loss of <i>Msh2<\/i>. We are currently evaluating the role of <i>Msh2<\/i> in the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in glioblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2f03cc73-d730-422e-a766-0386c5baba0a\/@s03B8ZMq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Mismatch repair deficiency,GEMMs,Temozolomide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20971"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Montserrat Puigdelloses Vallcorba<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alice Buonfiglioli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gonzalo Piñero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhihong Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dolores Hambardzumyan<\/i><\/presenter>.

To address these concerns, we developed an innovative Cre-inducible model of ES in zebrafish which allows broad mosaic expression of human EF1 in zebrafish, which causes rapid onset of ES at high penetrance. This invasive model allows study of the behavior of GFP-labeled cancer cells during tumor initiation and progression, in a complex developmental context which is not currently possible in mammals. We found that observed tumors express canonical EF1 target genes and stain for known ES markers including CD99. Proteomic analysis revealed that&#8239;EF1&#8239;expression affects heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) metabolism and activates HSPG-mediated ERK signaling in&#8239;EF1&#8239;expressing cells, promoting cancer cell survival and proliferation. Proteoglycans are key regulators of signaling of cell surface receptors, playing an essential role in cell-to-cell communication. Targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycans with the specific heparan sulfate antagonist Surfen reduces ERK1\/2 signaling and decreases tumorigenicity of ES cells in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight the important role of the extracellular matrix in ES tumor growth and the potential of agents targeting proteoglycan metabolism as novel therapies for this disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f97ae9b8-dd7e-4f49-b479-28394a3e4201\/@s03B8ZMq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-09 Zebrafish models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,Oncogene,Zebrafish,ERK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14411"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elena Vasileva<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikako Warren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Triche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Amatruda<\/i><\/presenter>.

The recourse to patient-derived xenograft (PDX) for the evaluation of new candidate anticancer drugs is becoming the gold standard in preclinical oncology. The faithful reproduction of patients&#8217; cancer features, and the possibility to generate a large number of models that recapitulate patient population genetic heterogeneity, confer PDXs a critical added value in the evaluation of new candidate drugs. These improved models will hopefully contribute to decrease the attrition rate observed in clinical trials, thus far unacceptably high. Over the last 15 years, we have generated and characterized a collection of 200+ PDXs from different solid tumors that accurately reproduce the histological and molecular heterogeneity of the tumors of origin. This panel has allowed for the preclinical validation of several anticancer drugs that are now used in the clinic. Although being an indispensable tool to complete preclinical studies, the use of PDX <i>in vivo<\/i> systems for large-scale screening during early drug discovery is hampered by ethical, economical and throughput burdens limiting the number of test articles being tested. To address this problem, we developed a panel of PDX-derived cell lines (PDXDCs) that we propose as a time and cost-effective medium-throughput screening tool to profile the anti-cancer activity of early test compounds. To date, 50+ PDXDCs from various indications such as breast, lung, prostate and many others have been generated and tested for their response <i>in vitro <\/i>towards standards of care and targeted anti-cancer agents matching patient clinical management. Differently from standard cell line establishment, which is obtained by expansion of a cell clone that survives in vitro plating, our cell line development technology allows for maintenance of tumor cell population heterogeneity. PDXDCs RNA and exome sequencing data faithfully match the parental PDX features, and by modulating experimental parameters, such as 2D or 3D growth conditions, drug exposure duration and endpoint read-outs, we could phenocopy <i>in vitro<\/i> the corresponding PDXs&#8217; sensitivities to chemotherapies. These results show our PDXDCs panel is a valuable <i>in vitro<\/i> platform for drug screening to help selecting drug candidates for further validation in parental PDX models <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e8855d52-53ae-4549-be04-e80c77e4a788\/@s03B8ZMq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell lines,Drug discovery,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14502"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Olivier Déas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Léa Sinayen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilie Indersie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathleen Flosseau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Banis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enora Le Ven<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Gabriel Judde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Stefano Cairo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
