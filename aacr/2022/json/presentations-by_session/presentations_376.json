[{"Abstract":"Off-the-shelf immune cell products derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have the potential to address many of the current limitations of engineered autologous and allogeneic blood-derived cell therapies. IPSC-based platforms offer a scalable and renewable source of allogeneic cells that can be engineered to augment cell phenotype and function. Current approaches to generating iPSC-derived immune effector cells have focused on recapitulating natural differentiation pathways to defined effector cell types (e.g., CD8 T cells or NK cells) utilizing feeder cells and exogenous cytokines. By engineering cells to express an artificial cytokine receptor, termed rapamycin activated cytokine receptor (RACR), we can control immune effector cell differentiation and expansion through synthetic signals independent of endogenous receptor expression, reducing the complexity and variability of cell differentiation while deriving cells with unique phenotypic and functional features not found in conventionally defined native immune cells. Here we demonstrate the ability to differentiate and expand synthetic cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells through engineering progenitor cells to express an artificial cytokine receptor, the RACR system, that is activated by a non-native small molecule ligand, rapamycin. This approach involves a period of feeder cell free hematopoietic and lymphoid progenitor specification followed by rapamycin-mediated activation of the artificial cytokine receptor (RACR), inducing an IL-2\/IL-15-like signal to drive cytotoxic innate lymphocyte differentiation and feeder cell free expansion resulting in approximately 3000-fold expansion from the iPSC starting material. The protocol has demonstrated robustness in the small-scale setting with multiple research-grade iPSC lines and enables extensive effector cell expansion at low cost, enabled by the stability of the rapamycin ligand and elimination of complex raw materials such as exogenous cytokines. The resulting RACR-induced cytotoxic innate lymphocytes (RACR-iCILs) exhibit potent polyfunctional anti-tumor activity driven by the synergistic activity of innate immune receptors and the engineered expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), including cytolytic activity and the secretion of IFN&#947; and TNF&#945;. The artificial cytokine receptor system can be used ex<i> vivo<\/i> to generate cells but also has the potential to enable rapamycin-controlled and selective expansion and survival of the engineered cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. Taken together, our data demonstrate the potential for <i>de novo<\/i> engineering of novel synthetic cytotoxic effector cells that show significant potential as &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; cancer therapeutics.

While these patients are initially responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), they eventually experience progression and develop acquired TKI resistance. Currently, there are no approved therapies for NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib (OSI). Moreover, EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLCs are refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have been used to enhance the anti-tumor activity of immune effector cells. Here, we developed CAR-based therapies targeting EGFR as a novel strategy to overcome immune suppression and target EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC. We designed multi-generational EGFR CAR constructs and transduced them into T and natural killer (NK) cells to generate CAR-T and CAR-NK cells, respectively. We then evaluated their activity against NSCLC cell lines <i>in vitro <\/i>using firefly luciferase assays. EGFR CAR-T and CAR-NK cells showed potent cytotoxicity against NSCLC cells expressing EGFR including EGFR wild-type and mutant NSCLCs, as well as NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to OSI. However, EGFR CAR-T cells showed decreased killing activity against OSI-resistant NSCLC cells compared to their parental cells. In contrast, EGFR CAR-NK cells showed stronger cytotoxicity against NSCLC with acquired OSI resistance as compared to parental cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to TKI had undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition and had downregulated expression of genes related to antigen presentation and upregulated expression of B7-H6 (<i>NCR3LG1<\/i>), which have been reported to be associated with increased responsiveness to NK cells. Moreover, treatment of TKI resistant cells with OSI resulted in upregulation of cell surface EGFR and potentiated CAR-NK cells-mediated killing. TGF-&#946; is a critical immune-suppressive cytokine. We found that EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC cells elaborated expression of TGF-&#946; as compared to parental cells. Blockade of the TGF-&#946; pathway using galunisertib significantly enhanced the activity of EGFR CAR-NK cells against OSI-resistant NSCLC cells. Next, we engineered the dominant-negative TGF-&#946; receptor II (DNTGFBRII) into our EGFR CAR constructs. The expression of DNTGFBRII inhibited the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and the downregulation of granzyme B and perforin induced by TGF-&#946;. DNTGFBRII-CAR-NK cells showed higher killing activity against OSI-resistant NSCLC cells and were resistant to TGF-&#946;-mediated immunosuppression. In conclusion, EGFR CAR-NK cells show significant anti-tumor activity to EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells, and the cytotoxicity is enhanced in combination with OSI treatment and blockade of the TGF-&#946; pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/98216a57-e76e-457a-b8a7-0e5f4229c401\/@u03B8ZFy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,CAR NK cells,EGFR TKI resistance,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16667"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yan Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monique Nilsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonia Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqulyne Robichaux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alissa Poteete<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoxing Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fahao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Heeke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junqin He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Heymach<\/i><\/presenter>.

The impact of the hinge and the transmembrane (TM) domain on modulating CAR T cell reactivity is important to investigate. Here, we isolated a camel nanobody D4 recognizing glypican 1 (GPC1), a cell surface proteoglycan that is expressed in pancreatic cancer. We constructed a series of D4 4-1BB&#950; CARs differing only by their hinge (CD8 or IgG<sub>4<\/sub>) and TM (CD8 or CD28). D4 CARs containing a mutated IgG<sub>4<\/sub> hinge and the CD28 TM, but not CD8 hinge with either TM, formed dimers in human T cells and resulted in improved stability of the CAR extracellular domain in a 3D structure model. The CAR dimerization increased phosphorylation of T cell signaling molecules, activated non-canonical NF-&#954;B signaling after antigen stimulation. Consequently, the D4-IgG<sub>4 <\/sub>hinge-CD28TM CAR T cells triggered the most cytokine secretion and showed the best reactivity against low GPC1-expressing pancreatic tumor cells among all the D4 CARs <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Conversely, a CAR with mutations of the two cysteine residues in the IgG<sub>4<\/sub> hinge disrupted CAR dimerization, damaged the formation of TM, and resulted in the loss of improved reactivity. Furthermore, adding extra spacers of CH<sub>3<\/sub> or CH<sub>2<\/sub>CH<sub>3<\/sub> between IgG<sub>4 <\/sub>hinge and CD28TM CAR attenuated the CAR activity. By optimizing the hinge and TM, our data indicated that 4-1BB&#950; CAR T cell activity can be optimized against low antigen density tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c37b897a-c89d-42c0-9b87-85462201decc\/@u03B8ZFy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Pancreatic cancer,Glypican-1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16668"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nan Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiajia Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raul Cachau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Ho<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite this remarkable success, common mechanisms of resistance, such as tumor antigen escape, tumor heterogeneity and weaker CAR activity with low levels of antigen, emphasize the need to further optimize CAR T-cell therapies. In addition, there is a need to develop allogeneic &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; therapies that are readily available at the time of treatment decision. To address these challenges, we generated UCART20x22, the first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell targeting two well-validated antigens in B-cell malignancies, CD20 and CD22. Using <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxic and proliferation assays, we demonstrated that UCART20x22 displays strong activity against tumor cell lines with diverse CD20\/CD22 antigen combinations<i>, <\/i>as well as increased activity against cells presenting both targets simultaneously. The specific activity of dual UCART20x22-cells persists overtime against tumor cells expressing both antigens (CD20, CD22) or only one. We also developed a pre-clinical model carrying subcutaneous lymphoma tumors expressing different antigen combinations in one single mouse. In this model, dual CAR T-cells provide efficient <i>in vivo<\/i> clearance of tumor cells expressing one or two antigens (CD20 and\/or CD22) in a dose dependent manner, starting at a low dose of 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> CAR T-cells. Using a disseminated model of lymphoma with different combinations of antigen-expressing tumor cells, we demonstrated robust efficacy and persistence of UCART20x22 cells in the bone marrow. Furthermore, we used primary Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma patient samples expressing diverse CD22 and CD20 antigen levels to demonstrate that UCART20x22 displays robust and specific cytotoxic activity as well as IFN&#947; release in all tested combinations. Besides efficiently targeting two commonly expressed antigens in B-cell malignancies, UCART20x22 incorporates TALEN&#174; mediated TRAC and CD52 specific gene editing to prevent Graft-vs-Host Disease and improve persistence in the presence of alemtuzumab (an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody that can be used as part of a lymphodepleting regimen). These attributes allow the production of allogeneic CAR T-cells from healthy individuals that can be administered at the time of treatment decision. In summary, we show an efficient first in class allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate with demonstrated <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>properties to overcome antigen escape in B-cell malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bcae3a7f-9f39-4e9f-979d-f95d7a594101\/@v03B8ZFz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16671"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Beatriz Aranda-Orgilles<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle Chion-Sotinel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Grudman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ben Mumford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chantel Dixon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roman Galetto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agnes Gouble<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurent Poirot<\/i><\/presenter>.

The receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR4 and immune checkpoint molecule CD276 are highly and heterogeneously expressed in some solid tumors, including Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood, and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, their expression is usually low in normal human tissues. These features make FGFR4 and CD276 promising therapeutic targets for CAR-T therapy for RMS and HCC. We have developed a FGFR4 targeting CAR construct (3A11-BBz) with a CD8 hinge (H) and a transmembrane domain (TM) infused with a 4-1BB intracellular domain (ICD). 3A11-BBz CAR can efficiently eliminate low RMS disease burden in metastatic models, but less effectively for bulky disease in RMS intramuscular (I.M.) xenograft models. Testing of a CD276 targeting CAR T-cells showed significant shrinking of tumors in RMS I.M. xenograft models.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> <b><\/b> To improve the CAR-T cells efficacy, we first modified the H\/TM and ICD of 3A11-BBz CAR to CD28 (3A11-CD28z). To overcome tumor heterogeneity, we also created Bicistronic CARs (BiCisCARs) combining the complete FGFR4 and CD276 CAR into a single construct allowing co-expression of both constructs on the same T cells. We then tested the efficacy of these CARs <i>in-vitro<\/i> and <i>in-vivo<\/i> using intramuscular FP-RMS xenograft (RH30) or HCC intraperitoneal models.<br \/><b>Results and Conclusions:<\/b> We found either FGFR4 targeting CARs or dual targeting BiCisCARs, showed similar <i>in-vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity against RMS cells and HCC cells. However, CARs with CD28 ICD released more IL-2 than those with 4-1BB ICD when co-cultured with target cells. In RMS I.M. xenograft model, 3A11-CD28z CAR-T cells shrank and eliminated the tumor in 5\/8 mice whereas 3A11-BBz only suppressed tumor growth. Furthermore, 3A11-CD28z BiCisCAR eradicated tumor cells in 8\/8 mice, whereas 3A11-BBz BiCisCAR showed very poor efficacy. Moreover, there are more 3A11-CD28z BiCisCAR T-cells persisting in blood and spleen than the other bicistronic or single CAR-T cells, suggesting this BiCisCAR-T cells have prolonged persistence. Therefore, we have developed a potent BiCisCAR dual targeting both FGFR4 and CD276 that overcomes RMS heterogeneity and effectively eliminates tumors <i>in-vivo<\/i>, which will be developed as a future therapeutic CAR for clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/461275f0-2b98-467c-ba75-71cf12f024a4\/@v03B8ZFz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4  (FGFR-4),CD276,Rhabdomyosarcoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16674"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meijie Tian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Cheuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Milewski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun S.

To generate an improved cell-based therapy against AML, our group has produced NK cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSC-derived NK cells effectively kill AML cells, but may benefit from combination with other therapies. Based on studies showing that targeting the CD47 pathway on macrophages (M&#981;) improves anti-tumor activity in AML, we investigated the combination of iPSC-NK cells with iPSC-M&#981; with and without CD47 blockade for the treatment of AML. To determine if the addition of iPSC-M&#981; can improve the cytotoxicity of NK cells against AML blasts, we co-cultured iPSC-NK cells and MOLM13 or MV-4-11 AML cells with iPSC-M&#981; in standard cytotoxicity assays. While M&#981; alone did not kill AML blasts, the addition of iPSC-M&#981; to iPSC-NK cells significantly improved killing of AML blasts by 50% (p&#60;0.01). Addition of an anti-CD47 mAb (B6H12) further increased killing of AML blasts by an additional 23% (p&#60;0.01). Addition of the CD47 mAb to iPSC-M&#981; without NK cells did not result in increased killing. We also demonstrated that blockade of SIRP&#945; (receptor for CD47) significantly increased NK cell killing of AML blasts by 16% (p&#60;0.05). Furthermore, the combination of iPSC-NK cells + iPSC-M&#981; + SIRP&#945; mAb led to a 37% increase in cytotoxicity compared to iPSC-NK cells + iPSC-M&#981; alone (p&#60;0.01). To confirm that addition of anti-CD47 or anti-SIRP&#945; antibodies increased killing via loss of the inhibitory CD47-SIRP&#945; interaction on NK cells and not via another mechanism, we tested the effect of adding anti-CD47 mAb and SIRP&#945; antibodies simultaneously. Compared to addition of either mAb alone, the combination induced no additional increase in anti-AML activity by the NK cells. We also found the addition of the SIRP&#945; mAb to iPSC-M&#981; alone did not increase cytotoxicity. We next evaluated if antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by anti-CD47 mAb binding AML cells could account for the increase in cytotoxicity and found that blockade of Fc-receptors on NK cells does not diminish the increase in cytotoxicity, indicating no role for ADCC. Finally, we showed that direct contact between NK cells and M&#981; is required to increase killing of AML in a transwell assay. Separation of iPSC-M&#981; from iPSC-NK cells by a transwell insert abrogated the increase in anti-AML cytotoxicity seen with addition of iPSC-M&#981; to NK cells without the insert. In vivo studies testing the combination of iPSC-NK cells, iPSC-M&#981; and CD47 mAb against human AML in mouse xenograft-models are ongoing. Together our results indicate that CD47 blockade combined with iPSC-M&#981; leads to increased NK cell-mediated anti-tumor activity. iPSC-NK cells and iPSC-M&#981; provide an important, standardized, allogeneic cell therapy approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1f2ee188-6695-4d50-bec7-2f71b9e6a8f7\/@v03B8ZFz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Natural killer cells,Macrophages,Cellular Therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16676"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin Goldenson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuel Fierro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Somayeh Pouyanfard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan S.

To date, autologous CAR-T-cell therapy has been the main clinical approach. However, autologous CAR-T cells have several major limitations including high-cost and complexity of production, donor-to-donor variability, and potentially severe toxicities. Allogenic NK cell-based therapies have also been shown to mount potent responses against hematopoietic malignancies (i.e., AML). However, unlike T-cell therapies, allogeneic NK cells do not cause toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or graft-vs-host-disease. Therefore, this approach provides an important platform for allogeneic CAR-enabled therapies. Several groups have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of allogeneic CAR-expressing NK cells that utilize CARs developed for T-cells. However, recent studies using NK cell-based activating receptor signaling modules such as NKG2D and 2B4 as CAR co-stimulatory domains proved increased anti-tumor activity compared to T-cell CARs. The goal of this study was to develop next-generation NK cell-optimized CARs to improve targeting and potency of our iPSC-derived NK cell therapies. To achieve this, we developed a platform to comprehensively screen immune cell signaling modules in iPSC-derived NK cells. First, we constructed a library of 44 novel CAR constructs containing signaling modules from diverse NK cell specific signaling receptors. Next, we developed a viral-based CAR expression protocol in mature iPSC-derived NK cells that yields high CAR expression (&#62;75% CAR<sup>+<\/sup>) while maintaining high viability (&#62;90%). We then screened for CAR activity using two co-culture target cell killing assays (eSight impedance assay and caspase 3\/7 killing assay) and two NK cell-resistant CD19<sup>+<\/sup> target cell lines (Raji and SupB15). Our screen identified 7 novel CAR signaling modules that performed better than both a second-generation T-cell CAR (CD28-CD28-zeta) and 3 previously described NK cell-CARs (NKG2D-2B4-zeta, CD28-OX40-zeta, and CD28-OX40L-zeta). These results were consistent across both functional assays and both target cell lines tested adding support to our findings. Overall, we have successfully developed an efficient CAR screening platform in iPSC-derived NK cells and have identified NK optimized CARs that enable increased potency of NK cells compared to current CAR solutions. The most potent CARs identified in our screen are being engineered into <i>CISH<\/i>-knockout iPSC-derived NK cells which were previously developed by us that demonstrate improved in vivo anti-tumor activity, in vivo persistence, metabolic fitness, polyfunctionality and resistance to cell exhaustion to create next-generation CAR-NK cell-based immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/60dd4b7d-aa2d-4675-bc0f-21a0654e60b8\/@v03B8ZFz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Stem cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16679"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lee Swanson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabrielle Allen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenyon Lyon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wael Tadros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Max Shabla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan S.

Adoptive immune cell therapy is a promising therapeutic modality given the remarkable clinical responses seen with autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in hematological malignancies. However, success of cell therapy in solid tumors has been more limited. Three major impediments to the success of adoptive cell therapies in solid tumors are the heterogeneity of antigen expression, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and the inherent challenges of manufacturing autologous cells and consequent variability of these cell products. Engineered, off-the-shelf, allogeneic Natural Killer (NK) cells provide a solution to these challenges. We describe here CAT-179, a novel engineered CAR-NK cell therapeutic for HER2+ solid tumors. CAT-179 cells express three transgenes: a HER2-directed CAR to effectively eliminate tumor cells, a Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) &#946; dominant negative receptor (DNR) for resistance to TGF&#946; -mediated immunosuppression in the TME, and Interleukin 15 (IL15) cytokine to enhance NK cell persistence and activity for durable response. High efficiency engineering of the large (~3.7Kb) cargo containing CAR, IL15, and DNR in CAT-179 is enabled by the non-viral TC Buster&#8482; Transposon System. Transposon engineering of CAT-179 results in high and stable expression of CAR (45% CAR at day 7 post gene delivery) without the need for post-engineering selection. CAT-179 demonstrates both CAR-dependent and innate NK receptor-dependent tumor cell killing in vitro, reducing the likelihood of tumor escape through antigen loss. CAT-179 effectively kills in vitro both high HER2-expressing SKOV3 cells as well as lower HER2-expressing HT-29 cells. CAT-179 also demonstrates resistance to TGF&#946; mediated immunosuppression, as evidenced by 75% reduction in TGF&#946; -induced phosphorylation of SMAD2 as well as prevention of TGF&#946; induced downregulation of NK cell activating receptors and restoration of NK cell cytotoxic activity. These data suggest CAT-179 cells will be protected from TGF&#946; -mediated immune suppression in the TME. Finally, the addition of IL15 in CAT-179 significantly enhances persistence for at least fourteen days in vitro without the need for exogenous cytokines. Moreover, CAT-179 administration to NSG mice showed expansion and persistence of the transferred cell product. CAT-179 addresses key hurdles to allogeneic cell therapy for solid tumors and is a promising new therapeutic approach for HER2 expressing breast, gastric and other tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a176c15f-4b36-4a15-a015-640b15903aa3\/@v03B8ZFz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,HER2,Chimeric antigen receptor,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16680"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Celeste Richardson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Finola Moore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andres Alvarez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexia Barandiaran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luke Barron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eugene Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tucker Ezell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlotte Franco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bashar Hamza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annie Khamhoung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taeyoon Kyung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marilyn Marques<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominic Picarella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jared Sewell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Storer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meghan Walsh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vipin Suri<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the median progression free survival is 8.8 months, suggesting that targeting BCMA alone may not be sufficient. Reports of BCMA-negative relapse have occurred, highlighting the need for therapeutics that can overcome antigen loss. We have generated a novel antibody against a second target in multiple myeloma, transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI). This antibody specifically recognizes TACI-positive cells (with either endogenous or exogenous expression) and has no recognition of non-B cell peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We designed novel second-generation CAR T cells based on the single chain variable fragment (scFv) from this antibody. We observe that anti-TACI CARs are cytotoxic <i>in vitro<\/i> at comparable levels to anti-BCMA CAR against multiple myeloma cell lines MM1S and RPMI-8226. Anti-TACI CARs are also functional in vivo and expand in peripheral blood of xenograft multiple myeloma models. We generated BCMA-knockout MM1S cells and observe that while anti-BCMA CAR treated mice have outgrowth of tumor, anti-TACI CAR treated animals retain anti-tumor activity. To overcome potential antigen loss of either BCMA or TACI, we designed tandem bispecific CAR T cells based on both single-targeting CAR designs. These BCMA and TACI dual-targeting CARs are functional <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, even in the context of single antigen loss. We monitor the activation (CD69), exhaustion (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3), and memory (CCR7, CD45RA) phenotype over time to investigate the differences of single versus dual-targeting CAR T cells. We also study the ability of these CAR T cells to bind soluble antigen, as well as their binding avidity to tumor cells. We observe that the anti-TACI scFv more proximal to the CD3&#950; signaling domain has a stronger effect on CAR functionality than when this scFv is more distal.

Lack of tumor-specific antigens, high probability of CAR T cell exhaustion, and an often-immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment limit CAR T cell efficacy and outcomes in the clinic. To address these challenges, AffyImmune has developed &#8220;Tune &#38; Track&#8221; technologies to reduce CAR affinity for antigens with disproportionally high density on tumor cells. Our CAR T cells are selective for tumor cells while leaving normal cells untouched, thereby increasing the therapeutic window and allowing for more physiological T cell killing. CAR T cells are also designed to express Somatostatin Receptor 2 (SSTR2), which allows for tracking <i>in vivo<\/i> via PET\/CT scan using FDA-approved DOTATATE. Our primary CAR design called AIC100 expresses an affinity-tuned variant of LFA-1, which is the natural ligand for Intracellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM)-1, a molecule that is highly expressed on some cancers. A single dose of AIC100 CAR T cells results in elimination of tumors in mice and significantly improves survival. We have tested the safety and anti-tumor activity of AIC100 in high ICAM-1-expressing animal tumor models including triple-negative breast cancer and gastric cancer. AffyImmune is currently conducting a Phase I study (NCT04420754) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of AIC100 in treating advanced thyroid cancer. After receiving 10 million AIC100 CAR T cells, FDG and DOTATATE imaging revealed preliminary evidence of CAR T expansion in the patient and tumor reduction at multiple lesions. To further optimize affinity-tuned CAR T cell activity within tumors, we are currently developing CAR designs that have the capability to deliver effector cytokines to the tumor microenvironment via a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-inducible promoter. Because our CAR T cells are affinity-tuned, off-tumor cytokine secretion is minimized. Our ICAM-1-specific CAR design called AIC1010 releases interleukin (IL)-12 cytokine upon engagement with target antigen within tumors, which induces production of interferon (IFN)-&#947; from immune cells and surrounding tissues, enhancing not only CAR T cell effector function but also the immune response focused within the tumor microenvironment. AIC1010 CAR T cells demonstrate superior cancer elimination compared to AIC100 CAR T cells in subcutaneous and IP tumor models in mice. We anticipate that cytokine delivery, paired with our &#8220;Tune &#38; Track&#8221; technology will be widely adaptable to develop potent and safe affinity-tuned CAR T cells against hard-to-treat solid cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71594980-c590-4095-bf77-50317bf80713\/@v03B8ZFz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cytokines,Thyroid cancer,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16685"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jingmei Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Michael P.

The sCAR system combines a CAR that recognizes peptide neoepitope (PNE) with an injectable &#8220;switch&#8221; molecule that consists of an anti-tumor Fab linked to PNE. Configurating PNE at different location or chain of the Fab enables us to identify best switches optimal for tumor targeting. Previous studies demonstrate that this sCAR system expressed in T cells provides tight control over anti-tumor activity. Here, we translated this approach to engineer natural killer (NK) cells with the sCAR to provide a universal, targeted cell-therapy approach in a patient-nonspecific manner. First, we engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with the sCAR combining the PNE-specific CAR scFv with our previously described NK cell optimized CAR4 signaling motifs consisting of the NKG2D transmembrane domain, 2B4 co-stimulatory domain and the CD3&#950; chain. We selected clones that maintained highest level of pluripotency and most stable expression of the sCAR4 on the surface. Next, we generated mature sCAR4-expressing iPSC-derived NK cells that expressed common surface receptors similar to that of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived NK cells. We then used three panels of switches with specificity to CD19 (consisting of 9 different configurations), to CD33, CD123 and CLL1 (1 configuration each), and to FRIZZLED7 (FZD7; 6 configurations) to target CD19<sup>+ <\/sup>B cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and ovarian cancer, respectively. All three targets demonstrated switch-specific dose response in killing tumor cell lines. Different configurations conferred variable efficiencies in switch-mediating tumor cell killings and the optimal switch concentrations were found to be different from what was observed previously with sCAR-expressing T cells. In a comparison with the &#8220;conventional&#8221; (non-switchable) CARs (cCARs), iPSC-NK cells expressing either sCAR4 and treated with an anti-CD19 switch or iPSC-NK cells with an anti-CD19-cCAR4 demonstrated similar level of cytotoxicity against B cell leukemia cells. Finally, we have built a mouse model and are currently testing the iPSC-NK-sCAR system in vivo. Together, this iPSC-NK-sCAR strategy enables close control over CAR-mediated activity with flexibility to target multiple tumor types and a potential to become a novel off-the-shelf therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dcf0de9e-6688-4bd5-99af-1e30ad05be3f\/@w03B8ZFA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,induced pluripotent stem cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16686"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiao-Hua Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Goldenson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaya Lakshmi Thangaraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Gynn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Gumber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myan Do<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karl Willert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan S.

We now present additional mechanistic data for this novel subcutaneous (SC) CAR-T approach.<br \/>Methods: Human PBMCs loaded with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector (LV) encoding CD19 CAR with a synthetic driver element were injected SC into autologous PBMC humanized NSG MHC I\/II double knock out (DKO) mice. The LV was packaged with a modified envelope with the ability to target and activate CD3+ T cells. To first track the site of CAR formation <i>in vivo<\/i> following SC injection, PBMCs were loaded with an LV encoding a CD19 CAR and luciferase, and bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was performed. Additionally, histopathology of the site of injection and distal organs were examined. Evaluation for CAR+ cells was performed through immunohistochemistry and PCR detection. To examine the tropism of the CD3-directed CD19 CAR LV and characterize CAR+ cells, the phenotype of <i>in vivo <\/i>expanded CAR+ cells was evaluated. Further characterization of <sup> <\/sup>CAR+ cells was performed with <i>in vitro<\/i> studies.<br \/>Results: Following SC injection of LV-loaded PBMCs, the first evidence of transgene expression utilizing BLI for luciferase was detected four to five days following SC injection. At the same time point, histologic examination of the SC site of injection revealed the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) consisting of human CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, CD68+ macrophages, CD68+ dendritic cells, and a few CD20+ B cells. On day 13 post-SC injection, BLI detected the presence of CAR+ cells systemically beyond the site of injection and within subcutaneous Raji tumors implanted on the contralateral side. On day 14 post-SC injection, histologic examination showed sustained TLS within the SC tissue without signs of dermal acute inflammation or ulceration and evidence of CAR+ cells appearing in the spleen.

Recent studies have shown that in vivo expansion and persistence of CAR-Ts are correlated with improved therapeutic outcomes in patients. Administration of IL-2 enhances CAR-T engraftment, persistence, and functionality in preclinical models. However, the clinical potential of IL-2 stimulation with cell therapies is limited using current molecules due to severe toxicity of high-dose IL-2 and the inadequate selectivity of existing engineered IL-2 variants which expand multiple endogenous cells in addition to CAR-T cells. To address this challenge, we have applied our cis-targeting technology to develop CAR-T selective IL-2 fusion molecules that specifically activate CAR-Ts, while exhibiting minimal activity on CAR-negative cells. Cis-targeted IL-2 fusions are comprised of a fusion between a targeting antibody and an IL-2 mutein having attenuated binding to IL2R&#9082; and IL2R&#946;. The attenuated cytokine selectively binds and activates IL-2 receptors on CAR-Ts via the avidity provided by the targeting arm. We engineered two cis-targeted CAR-T selective IL-2 fusions, CAR-IL2 or EGFRt-IL2. CAR-IL2 targets the FMC63 CAR directly without blocking CD19 antigen recognition, enabling targeting of approved anti-CD19 CAR-T products, and EGFRt-IL2 targets the EGFRt tag co-expressed with the CAR. Molecules were characterized in vitro using primary human CAR-transduced T cells. The in vivo activity was examined using tumor bearing NSG mice infused with human CAR-Ts. The specificity of the CAR-IL2 or EGFRt-IL2 molecules was demonstrated by their ability to selectively induce pSTAT5 signaling resulting in &#62;1000-fold preferential STAT5 activity in CAR-expressing cells compared to CAR-negative cells. The ability of the fusion proteins to selectively expand CAR-Ts in vivo was shown through a substantial and specific expansion of the infused CAR-Ts. The CAR-T fraction increased from approximately 50% of infused T cells, to over 93% of T cells, demonstrating a nearly 40-fold expansion in vivo. Re-expansion of CAR-Ts was demonstrated after allowing the CAR-Ts to rest in vivo &#62;100 days; re-dosing resulted in significant and selective re-expansion of CAR-T cells. Furthermore, treatment with the CAR-IL2 molecule enhanced tumor regression of CD19+ lymphoma-bearing mice infused with suboptimal doses of CAR-Ts. Together, these data demonstrate that our cis-targeted IL-2 molecules selectively activate CAR-Ts in vitro and enhance CAR-T expansion and anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Cis-targeted IL-2 fusion molecules directed by anti-CAR or anti-tag antibodies represent a promising approach to confer enhanced CAR-T activity in a specific and temporally controlled manner.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/73efc9d2-6d20-45b9-9788-37c4633c5fe9\/@w03B8ZFA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,CAR T cells,Interleukin-2,CD19,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16688"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nathan D.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have demonstrated that cell therapy can achieve durable remissions in hematologic malignancies. CAR-T cell therapies, however, have limited efficacy in solid tumors and are associated with severe toxicity, highlighting the need for safer and more efficacious novel cell therapies. With their intrinsic tumor killing capacity, few treatment-related toxicities, and the ability to be given to patients off-the shelf, natural killer (NK) cells are an attractive alternative therapy option to CAR-T cells. While most NK cell therapies are produced from healthy donor cells, deriving NK cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has the unique advantage that a clone with any desired edits can be generated. We aim to leverage our iPSC platform in combination with our proprietary gene editing technologies to create highly differentiated off-the-shelf treatments for solid tumors. Using our proprietary engineered AsCas12a, we generated double knocked-in (DKI) iPSC clones in which a bicistronic cargo encoding CD16 and a membrane-bound IL-15 (mbIL-15) was knocked into the GAPDH locus to increase the effector function and persistence of iNKs. Constitutive surface expression of CD16 and mbIL-15 by the DKI iNKs was demonstrated. DKI iNKs showed significantly increased natural and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity when compared to wild type (WT) iNKs in a SKOV3 tumor spheroid assay <i>in vitro<\/i>.<i> <\/i>Furthermore, in the absence of exogeneous cytokines, DKI iNKs persistence <i>in vitro<\/i> was dramatically improved over WT iNKs. The anti-tumor efficacy of the DKI iNKs <i>in vivo<\/i> was evaluated using a SKOV3 ovarian cancer model. Tumor bearing mice were treated with WT or DKI iNKs intraperitoneally in combination with trastuzumab or treated with trastuzumab alone. No exogenous cytokines were administered. DKI iNKs combined with a single dose or multiple doses of trastuzumab exerted greater tumor control compared to WT iNKs with trastuzumab, or trastuzumab alone. A single dose of DKI iNKs combined with three doses of trastuzumab induced tumor clearance in 6 out of 8 mice and significantly prolonged survival. Importantly, DKI iNKs were detected in the peritoneum of the treated animals for greater than 3 months, demonstrating that the mbIL-15 maintained iNK survival for a prolonged period of time in the absence of exogeneous cytokine support. In summary, knocking-in CD16 and mbIL-15 to the GAPDH locus of iPSCs dramatically increased the persistence of the DKI iNKs which exhibited robust anti-tumor activities in a solid tumor mouse model. These data demonstrate that our platform enables the development of off-the-shelf iNK cell medicines that may be highly effective for treating solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10215f93-1372-4eb8-84d2-7fd6474e5c9f\/@w03B8ZFA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Natural killer cells,CRISPR,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16690"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander G.

This TCR isolation platform is based on whole exome sequencing of a tumor and paired normal tissue control for the identification of non-synonymous mutations, including mutations in cancer driver genes (e.g., p53, KRAS, PI3KCA or HRAS). Bioinformatic algorithms were used to predict potential HLA-binding neoantigens (neoAg) in context of the patient&#8217;s HLA class I haplotype. A library of multimerized and barcoded predicted neoAg peptide-HLA molecules were generated to interrogate patient CD8 T cells. The paired &#945;&#946;-TCR sequences were derived from the single cell sorted T cells. TCRs from antigen experienced CD8 T cell were functionally validated by generating T cells expressing neoTCRs, using non-viral precision gene editing to insert the transgenic TCR chains into the endogenous TRAC locus. We previously showed that all (40\/40) TCRs isolated using this approach, reacted to patient-matched cancer cell lines (Puig Saus et al. AACR 2020).<br \/>Results: Neoantigen-specific T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of 243 patients with melanoma, bladder, endometrial, ovarian, colorectal, head and neck, urothelial and breast cancers were analyzed For each patient, an average of 352 neoAg-HLA capture complexes were predicted. Across all patients 58,058 neoAg-HLA complexes were manufactured, spanning 8,804 unique mutations. Among these, only about 2% represented known oncogene driver mutations. The predicted peptide-HLA binding affinity for cancer driver mutations was significantly lower (P&#60;0.001) compared to patient-specific neoAg. Remarkably, functional characterization of 206 TCRs showed that most TCRs (93.7%) recognized patient-specific neoAg. Despite the low percentage of neoAg-HLA capture complexes covering oncogene driver mutations (~ 2%), 6.3% of TCRs (13) targeted known cancer driver proteins. Primary human T cells were then engineered to express each TCR. TCR T cells became functionally activated only when exposed to the cognate antigen, irrespective of whether they target neoAg or cancer driver mutations, confirming the high degree of specificity of the isolated TCRs.<br \/>Conclusion: A landscape analysis of neoAg-specific TCRs recognizing mutations in cancer has revealed that most T cells recognizing neoantigen-HLA complexes are specific for private mutations in each cancer, though low frequencies of TCR targeting driver mutations can still be identified.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63cfbc6b-5897-408e-8b7f-f4d02e502010\/@w03B8ZFA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen,T cell,KRAS,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16691"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Barbara Sennino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jyoti Mathur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Conroy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Ting<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Yuen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zheng Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Stawiski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Mandl<\/i><\/presenter>.

Given the aggressive nature of the disease and difficulty in modeling tumor recurrence, minimal efforts have been made to design rational therapies against it. The roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) protein is involved in axonal guidance during neurodevelopment and is aberrantly upregulated in glioma where it mediates glioma cell migration. Here, we present that ROBO1 is highly expressed on the surface of malignant and treatment-refractory brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs), prompting the development of an anti-ROBO1 CAR-T cell therapy. Using the binding region of a single-domain antibody targeting ROBO1, we developed second-generation anti-ROBO1 CAR-T cells specific and effective against ROBO1-expressing BTICs. Upon antigen exposure, anti-ROBO1 CAR-T cells upregulated markers of activation and degranulation. Additionally, treatment of orthotopic and patient-derived brain tumor xenograft models with anti-ROBO1 CAR-T cells resulted in reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival, demonstrating the therapy&#8217;s therapeutic potential for treating neoplastic brain malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8c6e4967-7353-482a-8ef7-368827967580\/@w03B8ZFA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CAR T cells,Glioblastoma,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16694"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sheila Kumari Singh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chirayu R.
