[{"Abstract":"Background: Liver metastases develop in 20-50% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, being typically resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and having a poor prognosis. Our preliminary data showed synergy between IFN&#945; and TLR3 ligands in selectively enhancing the intratumoral production of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell (CTL) attracting chemokines (but not Treg attractants) in <i>ex vivo-<\/i>treated CRC explants and preferential impact of this combination on liver-metastatic CRC tumor tissues (rather than surrounding liver tissues). Based on these data and previous reports showing the prognostic value of intratumoral CTLs in the CRC outcomes, we hypothesized that systemic infusion of the combination of IFN&#945;2b with rintatolimod (selective TLR3 ligand for i.v. use) can reprogram local balance between the CTL- and regulatory T cell (Treg)-attracting chemokines and the resulting patterns of immune infiltrate in liver lesions.<br \/>Methods: Recurrent\/metastatic CRC patients with unresectable liver metastases amenable to biopsy were eligible. Patients had prior treatment (Rx) with fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and an anti-EGFR targeted therapy (if RAS wt), or contra-indication to such. Patients received IFN&#945;2b IV (20 million units\/m2 IV daily) and rintatolimod (200 mg IV daily) plus oral celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) on days 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, and 17. Response assessment was done via liver biopsies (pre-Rx and on day 24 &#177; 4 days) and CT imaging (RECIST v1.1) on D46. The primary endpoint was the change in CD8+ T-cells before Rx, with that seen post-Rx (measured by quantitative RT-PCR as a ratio of CD8&#945; to a housekeeping gene, HPRT). With a sample size of N=12 evaluable pts, the study design had a 90% power to detect a 0.77 standard deviation increase (pre- to post Rx) at a significance level of 0.1 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03403634).<br \/>Results: Nineteen patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC were enrolled between Apr 2018 and Oct 2020, 15 were treated and 12 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Most were male (75%, N=9) and Caucasian (92%, N=11). The median age at diagnosis was 65 years. Most had previously received three or more prior lines of therapy (58%, N=7). The study's primary endpoint was met, evidenced by increased CD8a expression post-treatment (p=0.046). An increase in ratios of CD8a\/CD4 (p=0.03), CD8a\/FOXP3 (p&#60;0.01) and GZMB\/FOXP3 (p&#60;0.01) was observed. The expression of CTL-attracting chemokines CCL5 (p=0.08), CXCL9 (p=0.05), and CXCL10 (p=0.06) were increased, while expression of the Treg\/MDSC attractant CXCL12 (p=0.07) was decreased post-Rx. Median OS was 10.5 (90% CI 2.2-15.2) months, and the median PFS was 1.5 (90% CI 1.4, 1.8) months. No objective response was seen. The treatment was well tolerated. Of all enrolled patients (N=19), adverse events were noted in 74% of patients, with the most common being fatigue (58%). Grade 3 or higher adverse events were rare (5%). Age, gender, line of treatment, RAS mutational status, and tumor location did not significantly impact CD8a change or PFS.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that a combinatorial CKM regimen could re-program the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in MSS CRC patients with liver metastasis, raising the possibility that the CKM regimen can be used to enhance the effectiveness of ICIs in this group of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/19eeb3e8-e901-421e-b802-1c2304d1140f\/@G03B8ZYn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,Colorectal cancer,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20243"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarbajit Mukherjee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick M.

We hypothesize that combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab could eliminate the primary tumor in T1aN0M0 patients ineligible for surgical treatment.<br \/>Methods: This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized phase 2 pilot study. Patients with biopsy-proven clear-cell RCC of &#8804;4 cm (cT1a), no evidence of any metastases, and unable to have surgery or other nephron-sparing interventions (ablation) or with preference to have no surgery or intervention for any reason received combination of ipilimumab (1 mg\/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks for four doses, and nivolumab (240 mg intravenously) every 2 weeks during 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was complete response rate. Simon's two-stage design was used. The null hypothesis that the true complete response rate was 11% and was tested against a one-sided alternative. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 0.9 when the true complete response rate is 60% (alternative hypothesis). The null hypothesis should be rejected if 3 or more responses are observed in 8 patients.<br \/>Results: Between February 2020 and June 2021, 8 patients were included. Median age was 77.9 years (range 73-89). Patients were Caucasian (100%), predominantly male (75%), 62.5% had centrally located RCC, 25% had ECOG PS 1, and 6 of 8 patients had moderate and severe comorbidities. Median follow-up was 12.7 months (95% CI 5.2-16.5). All patients received immunotherapy during 4 months without grade &#8805;2 adverse events. No complete responses were observed. Partial responses were found in 2 patients (25%). Median size of the primary tumor at RCC diagnosis and after immunotherapy was 3.11 cm (range 2.2-3.9) and 2.86 cm (range 1.5-4.0), respectively. Any shrinkage of the primary tumor was reported in 4 (50%) patients (change in median sum of diameters -18%). Only one patient had tumor enlargement (+0.5 cm (+13%) after 9 months. SBRT was used in this patient. All other patients are under active surveillance. Next secondary end-point of 3-year progression-free survival will be reported.<br \/>Conclusions: The activity of immunotherapy against primary tumor was limited in patients with T1aN0M0 RCC ineligible for surgical treatment. Duration of stable disease will be studied with long-term follow-up of these patients. Treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab was safe in patients with moderate and severe comorbidities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/945b1616-67f2-4d1d-a00f-fda4dd5c47db\/@G03B8ZYn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Ipilimumab,T1aN0M0,Nivolumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20244"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ilya Tsimafeyeu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Volkova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rustem Gafanov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Myslevtsev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrey Andrianov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Axel Bex<\/i><\/presenter>.

In terms of IHC, there is no strong rational to support the use of PD-L1 expression. <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations occur in 40-50% of melanomas and the MAPK pathway may also be activated by <i>NRAS<\/i> mutations. Patients harboring these mutations face usually a worse prognosis. BO-112 is a double stranded synthetic RNA formulated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) that, by mimicking the effect of a viral infection, mobilizes the immune system. Prior data from a phase I trial (NCT02828098) suggest that, when administered intratumorally, it causes an increase in CD8 infiltration and PD-L1 expression. The role of these and other biomarkers is being explored in the present phase II clinical trial.<br \/>Study Design: Single arm study with BO-112 plus pembrolizumab (NCT04570332) in patients with advanced melanoma in progression to anti-PD1 therapy. Tumors were genotyped by next generation sequencing, whole exome sequencing and tumor mutation burden. Antitumor and immunological effects of the treatment in the tumor microenvironment were assessed by PDL1 and CD8 immunohistochemistry with a paired biopsy performed after 21 days of treatment.<br \/>Results: A preliminary analysis has been performed, based on patients evaluable for clinical benefit (defined as response or stable disease&#62;16 weeks). Samples from 35 patients have been analyzed, with 24 patients paired biopsies available. Patients with &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors (PD-L1 negative and CD8 low) at baseline had a trend to lack of clinical benefit. Only basal PD-L1 in the inflammatory component showed a statistically significant correlation with clinical outcome (4\/20 (25%) tumors PDL1 IC negative had benefit versus 10\/15 (67%) positive), p=0.0053. Fifteen patients had an increase in PD-L1 and 14 patients had increase in CD8 infiltrate after BO-112 treatment; the lack of increase in PDL1 and CD8 after treatment was also predictive of lack of response (p=0.04). <i>BRAF\/NRAS<\/i> driver mutations correlated with positive outcome. Clinical benefit was observed in 4 of 17 (24%) patients not carrying activating mutations whereas 11 out of 18 (61%) patients with <i>BRAF\/NRAS<\/i> activating mutations had clinical benefit (p=0.02), mainly in cutaneous histology (14% versus 65%, p=0.02). Mucosal melanoma patients (n=3) achieved an ORR 66.7% and DCR 100%. The two mucosal melanoma patients with partial response harbored <i>SETD2<\/i> mutations and one of them showed extensive cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNGs), indicative of defects in DNA repair pathways. Regarding acral melanoma patients (n=9), no responses were observed, even in the single case with a <i>NRAS<\/i> mutation. The only patient achieving clinical benefit, with stable disease&#62;16 weeks; had a unique mutation profile, with<i> TP53<\/i> (inactivating) and KIT (activating) mutations.<br \/>Conclusions: Patients basal mutant <i>BRAF\/NRAS<\/i> could have more probability of benefit from BO-112 and pembrolizumab combination. PD-L1 and\/or CD8 increase is an early marker of response. These findings could help to select patients in future clinical trials.

However, tumor-induced immunosuppression promotes DC dysfunction and T cell exhaustion resulting in evasion of tumor immunity. In this study, we aimed to compare two approaches for engaging DCs and inducing an immune response to tumor antigens in the absence of tumor (melanoma)<br \/>Methods: This is a Phase II open-label, randomized, two-arm study to compare Arm A: Poly-ICLC-matured DC+PolyICLC to Arm B: Montanide ISA-51-VG+Poly-ICLC, as adjuvants for NY-ESO-1 and Melan-A\/MART-1 long peptides in patients with melanoma in complete clinical remission but at high risk of disease recurrence (NCT02334735). Each arm also received helper peptide, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) with the first vaccine and Poly-ICLC on day 2 of each vaccine. 36 patients were consented and randomized. Of these, 31 subjects received treatment, 16 in Arm A and 15 in Arm B. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine expression of NY-ESO-1 and Melan-A\/MART-1 and to determine the immune infiltrate landscape in the primary tumors. Humoral responses, TCR clonality, and inflammatory pathways were assessed by ELISA, bulk TCR sequencing, and Olink, respectively. Functional T-cell responses were investigated ex-vivo by interferon (IFN)-g enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) and after expansion by intracellular cytokine staining.<br \/>Results: Arm B induced a stronger humoral response vs Arm A against both Melan-A\/MART-1 and NY-ESO-1. A stronger ex vivo IFN-g response as well as expanded CD4+ T cell response against NY-ESO-1 was also induced in Arm B. However, the response to Melan-A\/MART-1, as measured by ex vivo ELISPOT and expanded CD4+T cell assay, was comparable in both arms. Interestingly, while similar proportions of patients in each arm displayed a CD8+ T cell response to NYESO-1, more patients in Arm A vs Arm B responded with a CD8+ T cell response to Melan-A\/MART-1 (9\/16 responders in Arm A vs 4\/14 in Arm B). Melan-A expression was observed in 81% of the patients but did not correlate with antigen specific immune response. TCR sequencing, Olink analysis and evaluation of NY-ESO-1 expression and immune infiltrates in the primary tumors is ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: This trial reached the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability. Arm B induced a stronger antibody and CD4+ T cell response, especially to NY-ESO-1, whereas the Arm A vaccine appears to be more efficient at eliciting CD8+ T cell responses against MelanA\/MART1. The seemingly enhanced CD8 T cell response in Arm A versus Arm B, could be attributed to frequency of specific HLA-I alleles in either arm or pre-existing immune response in select patients. A deeper investigation into correlation between HLA type and cellular immune response to vaccine is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6fa3511f-366e-4018-a691-00214e3fedf8\/@H03B8ZYo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Immuno-oncology,Tumor antigen,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20246"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mansi Saxena<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashleih Burke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Pavlick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Blazquez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gustavo Gimenez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcia Meseck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Donovan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mireia Castillo-Martin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tin Htwe Thin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Sabado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Mandeli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sacha Gnjatic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Friedlander<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nina Bhardwaj<\/i><\/presenter>.

Immunohistochemistry and gene sequencing are frequently assessed as part of clinical research. Radiomic signatures may also add valuable information, based on parameters which can be related to immune infiltration, therefore defining an imaging biomarkers panel for this clinical scenario. BO-112 is a double stranded synthetic RNA formulated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) that, by mimicking the effect of a viral infection, mobilizes the immune system. The role of imaging biomarkers is being explored in the present phase II clinical trial.<br \/>Study design: Single arm study with BO-112 plus pembrolizumab (NCT04570332) in patients with advanced melanoma in progression to anti-PD1 therapy. As part of exploratory objectives, a radiomics analysis was performed to detect changes in lesion texture features. Quantitative features were obtained by using Quibim Precision 2.9 platform (Quibim, Valencia, Spain) after the manual delineation of lesions on the CT study of each subject at each timepoint to obtain information about injected\/non-injected lesions. Images were normalized by taking into account Hounsfield Units (HU) bias across scanners in a cross-calibration phantom and the Z-score. The difference (Delta) in the features between baseline and week 8 was calculated.<br \/>Results: Studies were assessed based on event (progression) and based on whether lesions had been injected. Patients with only cutaneous disease were not included in this analysis. Out of 23 patients who had at least two imaging assessments, 6 developed progressive disease by week 8, and 17 subjects had no event by that time. Due to the small sample size, the radiomic analysis was based on hypothesis testing. With regards to volume, 50% of the non-progressing lesions reduced their value from that of the baseline. Regarding injected versus non-injected changes, up to 50% of injected lesions decreased their volume after 8 weeks of injected treatment whereas in non-injected lesions volume decreased in less than 25% of lesions. From the independent sample t-test of delta radiomics features against the injected\/non-injected lesions variable, there were 4 features with a statistically significant difference between groups; all of them related to the Low Grey-Level Zone Emphasis. Specifically, Delta original GLRLM Low Grey-Level Run Emphasis showed the highest significant difference between injected and non-injected lesions (p=0.004), with higher and positive delta values in the injected group (75% injected lesions were above 0).<br \/>Conclusions: Imaging biomarkers provide a large number of quantitative image features with a wide span of information, from size to heterogeneity of the tissue which may be indicator of tumor progression and immune infiltrate. In the analysis of radiomics features, delta GLRLM low grey-level zone emphasis was sensitive to the tumoral changes happening in injected lesions at week 8. This might add insights into the imaging-based evaluation of immune infiltration in intratumoral immunotherapy and the creation of associated imaging biomarkers panels.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6ea12c7a-6154-40c0-9b2e-4ba1b2e18940\/@H03B8ZYo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,radiomic,GLRLM Low Grey-Level ,Imaging biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20247"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Paula Moreno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Saiag<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis De la Cruz Merino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Dutriaux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eduardo Castanon Álvarez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Robert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan F.

Results in a cohort of pts with solid tumors with ATM mutation (mut) or deletion (del) treated with O are reported.<br \/>Methods: Eligible pts had solid tumors, no standard treatment (tx) options, measurable disease, ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function. Genomic testing was performed in CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited site selected labs. Pts received O tablets (300mg) or capsules (400mg) orally twice daily until disease progression. Low accruing histology-specific cohorts with the same genomic alteration were collapsed into one histology-pooled cohort for this analysis. Primary endpoint was disease control (DC) (complete (CR) or partial (PR) response or stable disease at 16+ wks (SD16+)) (RECIST v1.1). For histology-specific cohorts a Simon 2-stage design with a null DC rate of 15% vs. 35% (power = 0.85; &#945; = 0.10) requires 28 pts with futility stopping after 10 pts. For histology-pooled cohorts with sample size &#62; 28, if the lower limit of a one-sided 90% CI is &#62;15%, the null hypothesis of a DC rate of 15% is rejected. 2-sided 95% CIs were used for other efficacy endpoint estimates. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.<br \/>Results: 39 pts with solid tumors (17 histologies) with ATM mut (n=36) or del (n=3) were enrolled from 6\/2016 to 1\/2019. 3 pts were unevaluable for efficacy. Table 1 shows demographics and outcomes. 1 CR (prostate), 2 PR (unknown primary) and 6 SD16+ were observed in pts with ATM mut for a DC rate of 25% (90% CI: 16%, 100%) and an OR rate of 8% (95% CI: 2%, 23%). The null DC rate was rejected. 9 pts had &#8805;1 Grade 3 tx-related adverse or serious adverse event related to O.<br \/>Conclusions: Monotherapy O showed evidence of anti-tumor activity in pts with various solid tumors with <i>ATM<\/i> mut.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{A26E91CF-07E7-4AB7-8A95-64D778668D82}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Table 1: Demographics and Baseline Characteristics (N=39);

Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that antibody blockade of semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) promotes tumor infiltration and activation of DCs and CD8+ T cells and reverses immunosuppression, including attenuation of MDSC recruitment and function, leading to enhanced efficacy of ICIs. Pepinemab, a humanized SEMA4D blocking antibody, in combination (combo) with avelumab provided clinical benefit in some patients with ICI-resistant and PD-L1-low NSCLC. Pembrolizumab (pembro) is approved as monotherapy or in combo with chemo for the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic (R\/M) HNSCC. More effective treatments are, however, needed to increase the frequency and duration of responses. The primary hypothesis of this proof-of-concept study is that pepinemab in combo with pembro will yield increased clinical benefit compared to the reported activity for pembro monotherapy in R\/M HNSCC.<br \/>Methods: KEYNOTE B84 (NCT04815720) is a multicenter, single-arm open-label study evaluating the safety, efficacy, and PK\/PD of pepinemab in combo with pembro as first-line treatment of R\/M HNSCC. Subjects with measurable disease per RECIST1.1, ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and PD-L1 CPS &#8805; 0 are eligible; subjects who have received prior ICIs or other systemic treatment for R\/M HNSCC are excluded. The study includes a safety run-in (n=3) and dose-expansion phase (maximum n=62). Pepinemab, previously found to be well-tolerated in combo with other ICIs, will be evaluated initially at the highest intended dose of 20 mg\/kg, in combo with 200 mg pembro, both administered i.v. Q3W. The dose expansion phase will include an equal distribution of subjects who have tumor PD-L1 combined positive scores (CPS) of &#60;20 and &#8805;20. The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR, and the secondary endpoints are PFS, DoR, and OS, as well as exploratory biomarker analyses. Pre- and on-treatment biopsies will be collected for evaluation of immune contexture in TME.<br \/>Results: The safety run-in phase (n=3) was successfully completed. The combo was well tolerated with no DLTs observed. One of the three patients had a confirmed complete response, a second patient progressed with several SAEs attributed to comorbidities (diabetes) deemed unrelated to treatment, and the third patient has not yet completed tumor evaluation. The safety monitoring committee has recommended that the dose-expansion phase be initiated at 20 mg\/kg pepinemab and 200 mg pembro Q3W.<br \/>Conclusions: The ongoing KEYNOTE B84 study completed the initial safety run-in phase. Phase 2 will evaluate pepinemab, a SEMA4D inhibitor, as a novel strategy to potentially overcome resistance and enhance activity of pembro in R\/M HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a45b18c-bbee-49f9-899d-53b51187a1d4\/@H03B8ZYo\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination studies,pepinemab,pembrolizumab,semaphorin 4D,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20249"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Terrence L.

The Phase II LCMC3 (NCT02927301) study evaluated pre-operative treatment (tx) with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) in pts with untreated early stage resectable NSCLC, achieving a 20% major pathologic response (MPR) rate (primary efficacy pts, n=143). A digital PD-L1 scoring method was developed to assess PD-L1 expression as a potential predictive marker for MPR in squamous and non-squamous tumor samples from LCMC3.<br \/>Methods: Manual scoring was used to determine PD-L1 status on pre-tx biopsy samples using the tumor proportion score (TPS) with a positive threshold of TPS&#8805;50 (22C3). Binary results were correlated with MPR and stratified by squamous\/non-squamous histology. A digital pathology workflow for automated PD-L1 scoring was developed to yield a precise continuous PD-L1 TPS. Deep convolutional neural networks trained using pathologist annotations were used to detect individual cells within the tumor and tumor microenvironment and quantify their PD-L1 expression. These cell type predictions were used to compute a digital PD-L1 TPS. LCMC3 pts with available digital and manual PD-L1 scores were then used to assess the role of PD-L1 expression in predicting MPR.<br \/>Results: PD-L1 scores were available for pre-tx biopsies from 108 pts. No significant difference in scores was seen between histological subtypes. At cutoff (Oct 15, 2021), TPS&#8805;50 was seen in 41 (non-squamous, n=26 [39%]; squamous, n=15 [36%]) of 108 pts and was associated with MPR in non-squamous (odds ratio [OR], 28.6; <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001; Fisher&#8217;s exact test) but not squamous histology (OR, 1.3; <i>P<\/i>=1.0). Continuous digital PD-L1 scores (range: 0-100) were highly correlated with local manual PD-L1 scores (range: 0-100) for squamous (n=42, Pearson <i>r<\/i>=0.90, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001) and non-squamous stained histology slides (n=66, Pearson <i>r<\/i>=0.90, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). Continuous digital and manual PD-L1 TPS on pre-tx biopsies (n=108) were predictive of MPR (digital: area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC)=0.678, logistic regression [LR] <i>P<\/i>=0.01; manual: AUROC=0.675, LR <i>P<\/i>=0.003). Strikingly, when pts were stratified by histology, PD-L1 scores were predictive of MPR from pre-tx biopsies for non-squamous samples (n=66; digital: AUROC=0.821, LR <i>P<\/i>=0.002; manual: AUROC=0.819, LR <i>P<\/i>=0.001) but not for squamous samples (n=42; digital: AUROC=0.519, LR <i>P<\/i>=0.93; manual: AUROC=0.506, LR <i>P<\/i>=0.90), despite no significant difference in MPR rate between the 2 groups.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>These findings support using digitally assessed PD-L1 IHC as a centralized and standardized scoring system and suggest that tumor histological subtype could be an important factor in the utility of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for neoadjuvant CIT in early stage NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/752dae3e-1783-4035-a035-2f6966b2a63d\/@H03B8ZYo\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunohistochemistry,Neoadjuvant,Digital pathology,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20250"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John Abel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Rivard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filip Kos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guillaume Chhor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Giltnane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Hoffman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murray Resnick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cyrus Hedvat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amaro Taylor-Weiner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Farah Khalil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Nicholas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory A.

Inhibition of CHK1 has shown activity in BRCAwt HGSOC. Here, we report the clinical activity and tolerability of the second generation CHK1 inhibitor, prexasertib, in platinum-resistant BRCAwt HGSOC (NCT02203513).<br \/>Methods: Eligibility included platinum-resistant recurrent HGSOC women without germline or somatic BRCA mutation, ECOG PS 0-2, good end organ function, and measurable disease. The primary endpoint was response rate (RR). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Prexasertib was given at 105 mg\/m2 IV every 14 days in a 28-day cycle. CT scans were performed every 2 cycles for RECIST v1.1 evaluation, and safety evaluation using CTCAE v4.0 every cycle. CBC was performed on day 8 of cycle 1 for ANC nadir. Pretreatment clinical samples were collected for biomarker analysis including HR deficiency and circulating tumor cells (CTC).<br \/>Results: Between January 2017 and November 2020, 49 patients (median age 64.1 years [IQR 56.8 - 69.9]) received at least one dose. 12 (24.5%) patients were primary platinum-resistant, and 37 (75.5%) were secondary platinum-resistant. All were heavily pretreated (median 4 prior systemic therapies [IQR 3 - 7]), including bevacizumab (79%), PARP inhibitors (44%), and both (2%). 39 patients were evaluable by RECIST and RR was 30.7%. The median PFS was 5.8 months (range 1.7-26.4 months). The median duration of response among PRs was 5.5 months (range 1-19.8 months). The clinical benefit rate (PR+CR+SD &#62;4 months) was 84.6%. 10 patients were inevaluable due to: withdrawal of consent (n=2), intercurrent illness related to disease (tumor invasion of mainstem bronchus (n=1) or vaginal wall (n=1), small bowel obstruction (n=2), infection (n=2), failure to thrive (n=1), and pneumothorax secondary to thoracentesis (n=1) during cycle 1. The common (&#62;10%) grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) included neutropenia (85%, 42\/49) based on the cycle 1 day 8 CBC at the time of ANC nadir, lymphocytopenia (46%, 23\/49), thrombocytopenia (40%, 20\/49), anemia (30%, 15\/49), and febrile neutropenia (12%, 5\/49). 83% (41\/49) of patients received growth factors support to avoid subsequent treatment delays. There were no deaths on the study. No significant difference of RECIST response or PFS was observed in patients with high (&#8805;2) vs low (&#60;2) CTC at baseline.<br \/>Conclusions: Prexasertib monotherapy resulted in clinical benefit in subgroups of heavily pretreated BRCAwt platinum-resistant HGSOC.

There is no standard treatment for recurrent GBM patients who progress under TMZ treatment. We previously demonstrated that bortezomib (BTZ) depletes MGMT protein and sensitizes MGMT unmethylated GBM cells to TMZ <i>in vitro<\/i> and in PDX models when administered in precise dose and sequential schedule. TMZ dose escalation in phase IB part of the trial was tolerated, safe and associated with immunological responses in selected patients. We hypothesized that recurrent GBM patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter may obtain clinical benefit from sequential combination of BTZ and TMZ treatment.<br \/>Methods: The sample size was calculated to 63 patients for this phase IB\/II study, 10 were included in the phase IB and the rest are ongoing in phase II. A cohort of 467 patients treated at Oslo and Haukeland University Hospitals were used as controls. We report interim results of n=32 MGMT unmethylated recurrent GBM patients progressing at least 12 weeks after completion of postoperative radiotherapy, with adequate organ function, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &#8805;70 and radiologically measurable lesions treated on BORTEM-17 protocol. The patients received intravenous BTZ 1.3mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on days 1,4,7, during each 4-week chemotherapy cycle starting on day 3 with per oral TMZ at 200mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> 5 days\/week. Mantel-Cox regression analyses was used to calculate survival.<br \/>Results: Until January 2022, 32 patients with median age 54 yrs (range 25-66 yrs), 23 male and 9 female were treated at 3 different referral university hospitals in Norway. 81% (26\/32) were IDH wt. Median KPS was 90 (70-100) and median NANO score was 1 (0-7). 9\/32 patients are still alive. Preliminary data indicates 20% of patients showed clinical and radiological responses, where 4\/6 (67%) obtained partial response and 2\/6 (33%) had stable disease. BORTEM-17 patients&#8217; median survival was significantly better than all controls (23.7 months vs 12.1 months) HR<sub>0.61, <\/sub>95% CI [0.44-0.85], <i>P<\/i>=0.003. The Median survival for BORTEM-17 patients was 23.7 months vs 11.4 months for control MGMT unmethylated patients HR<sub>0.46, <\/sub>95% CI [0.33-0.63], <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.0001. When adjusted for age, BORTEM-17 patients&#8217; median survival was 23.7 months vs 12.9 months of control MGMT unmethylated patients HR<sub>0.51, <\/sub>95% CI [0.34-0.75], <i>P<\/i>=0.0007. Patients&#8217; self-reported quality of life was good. Majority of the side effects were mild or moderate.

The goal of this trial (DURVA+) is to evaluate and compare the immune-modulating effects of six different chemotherapy agents with Durvalumab (D), a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. We report here the first analysis of one of the arms of DURVA+: D plus capecitabine (C).<br \/>Methods: This is a non-randomized phase 2 trial for adult patients (pts) with refractory advanced solid tumors. Pts received C at a dose of 1250 mg\/m2 bid on days 1-14 of 21-day cycle. For the first 3 cycles, D is administered every 2 weeks at a dose of 750 mg IV starting on C1D8. From cycle 4 onwards, D was given at a dose of 1125 mg IV every 3 week (day 1 of each 21-day cycle). Tumor biopsies were required at baseline, C1D8 (prior to durvalumab), C3D8, and optional at progression. Radiologic tumor assessment occurs every 4 cycles by RECIST. iRECIST is assessed as a secondary endpoint. Baseline and at least one on-treatment biopsy were obtained for 11 patients, at least 8 of which are evaluable for pharmacodynamic (PD) response (treatment-induced changes in immune cell tumor content and function).<br \/>Results: As of Nov 10, 2021, 14 pts were enrolled to this arm. Median age 57 (range 31-73 years), 7 males and 7 females, 4 black, 8 white, 2 unknown race. Majority of pts had colorectal carcinoma (ca) (n=8), other include (n=1 each): appendiceal, anal squamous cell ca, leiomyosarcoma, pancreatic ca, breast ca, and nasopharyngeal squamous cell ca. Median lines of prior treatment was 3.5 (1-13), 4 pts previously received ICI. Median number of days on study treatment were 83 days. One pt experience partial response (breast) and five pts experienced SD (3 colon, 1 pancreatic, 1 non-uterine leiomyosarcoma) for a median duration of 136 days as of Jan 3, 2022 (data cutoff); one pt with pancreatic ca experienced a 27% reduction in sum of target lesions. Treatment related adverse events (TrAE) of all grades occurred in 13 pts, serious TrAEs (more than grade 2) occurred in 8 pts and included anemia, pulmonary embolism, hyperbilirubinemia, palmar plantar syndrome, neutropenia, lymphopenia and diarrhea. Immune-mediated AEs included transaminitis\/hepatitis (n=4, all grade 1\/2), hypothyroidism (n=2, grade 1\/2), rash (n=1, grade 1) and colitis (grade 3). PD studies are still ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: The combination of durvalumab with capecitabine is feasible with no unexpected adverse events. PD assessment is ongoing to examine the hypothesis that chemotherapy alters tumor micronenvironment (TME) and T cell activation.
