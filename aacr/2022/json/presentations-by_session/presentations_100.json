These factors are particularly relevant to tumor immunity as immune cell composition and localization within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is one of the major determinants of response to immunotherapy and patient outcome. Spatially resolved single cell genome sequencing has revealed that many genetically distinct sub-clones exist in proximity in tumors and can have different TME compositions, but how specific genes influence the TME, or how neighboring clones influence one another is not well-defined. Indeed, while some genes involved in orchestrating the TME have been identified, the potential roles of many genes in influencing the architecture and immune composition of different tumors are not established. To enable scale up studies to identify determinants of TME biology and tumor immunity, we established a first-of-its-kind in vivo spatial functional genomics platform called Perturb-map. We applied Perturb-map to knockout (KO) dozens of genes in parallel in a mouse model of lung cancer and simultaneously assessed how each KO influenced tumor growth, histopathology, and immune composition. Additionally, we paired Perturb-map and spatial transcriptomics for unbiased analysis of CRISPR-edited tumors. In contrast to in vitro CRISPR screens, we found KO of positive regulators of IFN&#947; signaling led to a major reduction of tumor burden, with varying impact from different pathway components. KO of Socs1, a negative regulator of IFN&#947; signaling, provided a growth advantage though was accompanied by increased T cell infiltration and notably, Socs1 KO tumors were more responsive to PDL1 blockade. Perturb-map also found that KO of the TGF&#946; Receptor 2 (Tgfbr2) resulted in a growth advantage, but unlike Socs1 KO, T cells were excluded from the lesions and the TME converted to a fibro-mucinous state. Spatial transcriptomics revealed TGF&#946; signaling was upregulated in Tgfbr2 KO tumors. Further analysis indicated this signal was from TGF&#946;-mediated activation of fibroblasts in tumors where cancer cells lost Tgfbr2, suggesting the mechanism for TME remodeling and T cell exclusion in Tgfbr2 KO tumors. These studies establish Perturb-map for functional genomics within tissue at single cell-resolution with spatial architecture preserved and provide insight into how TGF&#946; responsiveness of cancer cells can affect the TME (Dhainaut, Rose et al.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in the combination of antibodies blocking two co-inhibitory receptors on T cells, PD-1 and TIGIT, with randomized phase II results in non-small cell lung cancer having yielded significant overall survival benefit. We have investigated the mechanistic rationale for this combination and found that the inhibition of both co-inhibitory receptors is required to most effectively re-activate the two co-stimulatory receptors controlled by PD-1 (CD28) and TIGIT (CD226). Indeed, both co-stimulatory receptors serve as clients of PD-1 which recruits cytosolic phosphatases (eg SHP2) to inactivate the ITAM motifs in both CD28 and CD226. TIGIT acts to inhibit CD226 function in T cells solely by outcompeting it for ligand (CD155\/PVR) binding. Unexpectedly, preclinical studies have demonstrated that ligand blocking antibodies to TIGIT are most effective when they contain a functional Fc domain. This observation suggests that at some level, Fc receptor-bearing cells play a role in mediating the function of anti-TIGIT blockade. Although this may reflect a modulation of T regulatory cell or NK cell function, both of which are TIGIT-positive, there are several observations that implicate the involvement of myeloid cells, namely macrophages and dendritic cells. One such observation is the fact that in the case of PD-1 blockade, the most relevant pool of PD-L1 turns out to be expressed by dendritic cells: in mice, genetic elimination of PD-L1 expression by tumor cells or macrophages exerts little effect on tumor growth, whilst PD-L1 elimination from dendritic cells greatly enhances endogenous anti-tumor immunity (Oh et al., 2020, Nature Cancer). This result further suggests, as is now becoming more widely accepted, that PD-L1\/PD-1 blockade primarily acts by enhancing the activation of tumor-specific T cells during antigen presentation by dendritic cells, rather than by the rejuvenation of exhausted intratumoral T cells. Given the client relationship between PD-1 and CD28\/CD226, it seems reasonable that TIGIT blockade similarly works at the level of antigen-presenting myeloid cells, either dendritic cells or macrophages. In the case of TIGIT, the requirement for an intact Fc domain further implies that T cell-bound anti-TIGIT may work as an opsonin that concomitantly triggers Fc&#947; receptor signaling to alter the functional status of the myeloid compartment. Thus, not only is there a convergence between the PD-1 and TIGIT pathways, but also a convergence between T cells and myeloid cells that may be essential for the function of these regulatory pathways and for the therapeutic effect associated with their blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ira Mellman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Furthermore, T cells and other immune populations in the TME communicate extensively with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) which are typically simply described as &#8216;suppressive&#8217;, but whose functions are certainly more complex. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we designed two types of novel genetic marking systems to visualize, track and manipulate (i) T cell subsets with distinct activation histories and (ii) specific subsets of macrophages, modulating primarily those in the TME, to study and define these co-evolving immune states.<br \/>We generated a novel T cell activation reporter mouse, which is a transcriptional reporter of CD69 expressing the fluorescent protein TFP. By recording transcriptional activity of a locus where the protein expression is under tight, activation-dependent post-transcriptional control, we generated a reporting system to read out contemporary as well as historic T cell triggering. While cell surface CD69 reliably indicates current activation, resting TFP (Cd69 mRNA) expression is downregulated with successive TCR triggering and hence an inverse marker of chronic stimulation. Using multiple tumor models in vivo, tumor slice cultures ex vivo and scRNA-Seq, we thus defined and tracked over time distinct functional states of intratumoral T cells based on their activation histories. These data revealed key insights including the delineation of quiescent versus activated states within progenitor, effector and exhausted T cells and the trajectory of inter-conversion that leads to the emergence of these states in the TME. Probing the inflection points in this differentiation trajectory reveals a particularly interesting subset of CD69+TFP+ cells, representing intratumorally activated effector CD8 T cells prior to their dysfunctional adaptation to chronic stimulation. Dissecting their phenotype led to the discovery of a previously unexplored subset of intratumoral T cells of functional significance. Indeed, these cells were enriched specifically in the context of T cell-mediated tumor control in mice and their phenotypic markers correlated with improved outcomes and survival in human patients.<br \/>To complement this system, we generated a second genetic strain of mice that allowed specific depletion of TAMs. The prevailing view of M1 vs. M2 TAMs as ostensibly anti-tumor vs. pro-tumor, although useful, is almost certainly over-simplistic and has lacked further delineation, limited by the quality of available tools to specifically manipulate TAMs in situ. Remarkably, till now, a method to specifically deplete TAMs, without global depletion of all macrophages (e.g CSF1R blockade, Clodronate) did not exist. We alleviated this problem by using this novel mouse strain, in which conditional (lox-Stop-lox flanked) YFP and DTR genes are knocked into the endogenous CD206 locus. Since, within macrophages, CD206 is largely expressed in tumors, an intercross of this allele with a Csf1r-Cre (to specify monocyte-derived lineage) provides a 2-allele gating system to limit and robustly penetrate reporter and depletion function to TAMs. In multiple TAM-rich tumor models, this revealed that TAMs assumed context-dependent divergent roles in anti-tumor immunity. On the one hand, their removal led to a mitigation of T cell<br \/>exhaustion, consistent with the popular notion that they are immunosuppressive and in need of global elimination. However, our data also reveals that macrophage depletion not only fails to alleviate the tumor burden but also prevents successful T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. We linked the latter effect to an obligate role for TAMs in the recruitment and maintenance of cDC1s and CD8 T cells in the TME, respectively. By live imaging of TAMs in vivo using the reporter and subsequent spatially resolved scRNA-Seq, the key TAM subsets and interactional networks involved in these processes were established. Importantly, in responsive tumor models, TAM depletion subverted T cell-mediated tumor control, demonstrating their importance in organizing anti-tumor adaptive immunity.<br \/>We thus combine the use of novel engineered mice in vivo, real time imaging and spatial transcriptomics with functional studies to shed new light on immune dysfunction in the TME. Defining the ontology of functional immune states in the TME provides a clear target space to maneuver cancer immunotherapies. Herein, we offer prime examples of dissecting the spatiotemporal biology of CD8 T cells and TAMs in anti-tumor immunity to define such interdependent states. These findings and the newly established models therein pave the way to deepen as well as broaden our understanding of the complex immune landscape in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor associated macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arja Ray<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bushra Samad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Hernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Krummel<\/i><\/presenter>.
