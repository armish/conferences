[{"Abstract":"ER+\/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancers represents a large patient population served by CDK4\/6 inhibitors combined with hormonal therapy as standard of care. As acquired resistance emerges, molecular profiling indicates about &#62; 100 different mutations render resistance, creating challenges for treating physicians, patients, and the healthcare system broadly. The aim of our work is to maintain consolidation of this large patient population by developing targeted therapies to a key fundamental mechanism at the convergence of many oncogenic signaling pathways through which resistance arises. The regulation of CAP dependent protein translation is a central element in oncogenesis. One of a family of CAP binding proteins, eIF4E serves to anchor the m7GTP CAP of RNA into several protein complexes and regulates multiple aspects of mRNA processing such as nuclear export and ribosomal translation. Our efforts focused on simultaneously developing potent small molecule modulators of eIF4E and patient hypotheses through which to direct their initial clinical use. By aligning medicinal chemistry tools with patient directed pharmacology, we optimized our inhibitors to identify orally bioavailable, nM modulators of eIF4E. Biochemical assays demonstrated direct binding and allosteric modulation of eIF4E activity by PICRN941, along with Proximity Ligation Assays (PLA) demonstrating reduced eIF4E and 4G association in cells. Western analysis demonstrated that PICRN941 induced simultaneous and significant modulation of a number of key oncogenes that have been postulated to drive intrinsic or acquired resistance in response to standard of care including anti-estrogen treatment, CDK4\/6 inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors combined with hormonal therapy, including MYC, CDK2, CDK4, CCND1 and eIF4E itself. Treatment of ER+ breast cancer cell lines including ZR-75-1, T47D, and ZR-75-30 with PICRN941 induced a dose dependent reduction in the levels of hyper-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 commensurate to increases in unphosphorylated 4E-BP1, and dose-dependent reduction in protein expression of Cyclin D1, CDK4, ER alpha, phosphorylated Rb and eIF4E. Reduced protein expression correlated with subsequent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We further studied our inhibitors in primary patient derived organoids in collaboration with the Hubrecht Institute, where we observed potent and complete responses in breast cancer organoids that represent patient populations where unmet needs remain high including PTEN and RB null organoid models. Markers of target engagement correlated well with organoid model sensitivity, including Cyclin D1 responses. Our findings suggest that our allosteric eIF4E modulators may provide a unique and efficient therapeutic approach to address multiple resistance mechanisms across cancer patient populations, toward fulfilling the promise of this elusive target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f0c9cf56-7c23-4a70-a295-642d30c5e78b\/@r03B8ZDD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EIF4E,Translation,Cyclin D1,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15281"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lisa Sturla<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bassil Dekky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuemei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine S.

Current treatment, which combines surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy, yields marginal benefit and ultimately results in drug resistance or recurrence. Therefore, developing more effective treatments is an urgent unmet need. Among the most common genomic abnormalities in mesothelioma are alterations of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A\/B (<i>CDKN2A\/B<\/i>) and neurofibromin 2 (<i>NF2<\/i>). Combined <i>CDKN2A<\/i> deletions and <i>NF2<\/i> loss is a negative prognostic factor for both progression-free and overall survival. Mesothelioma cells lacking expression of <i>CDKN2A\/B<\/i> or <i>NF2 <\/i>are reported to be sensitive to CDK4\/6 or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition, respectively. This study explored the potential utility of combining CDK4\/6 inhibitor palbociclib and APG-2449, an investigational, clinical-stage ALK\/ROS1\/FAK inhibitor, in preclinical models of mesothelioma. Compared to controls and either single agent, the combination of palbociclib and APG-2449 enhanced inhibition of growth of cultured mesothelioma cells. This binary combination also synergistically induced durable antitumor activity in multiple murine mesothelioma models, including both cell line- and patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, treatment of mesothelioma cells with this combination likely downregulated FAK phosphorylation and enhanced cellular senescence and autophagy, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of &#946;-galactosidase-positive cells and upregulation in protein expression levels of autophagy markers P62 and LC3B. The combination also downregulated DNA damage-relevant proteins high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) and &#947;-H2A histone family member X (&#978;-H2AX). Taken together, the data implicate that an interplay between autophagy and DNA damage repair contributes to the synergistic antitumor effects. In summary, our results unveil a novel potential therapeutic strategy of targeting both FAK and CDK4\/6 in order to synergistically inhibit tumor growth in mesothelioma. The synergistic effects are evidently mediated by induced autophagy and enhanced cellular senescence. This preclinical study lays a foundation for future clinical development of APG-2449 combined with CDK4\/6 inhibitors for mesothelioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/014da19d-f711-47b9-bc9e-d3ca69679569\/@s03B8ZDE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inhibitors,CDK4\/6,Autophagy,APG-2449,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15289"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ran Tao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Douglas D.

Disruption of these specific cell programs can result in cancer and create a subset of tumors that are &#8220;transcriptionally addicted.&#8221; Sarcomas, for example, are characterized by an oncogenic fusion protein consisting of a FET family RNA-binding protein fused to a transcription factor (TF). The oncogenic fusions result in a restructuring of the transcriptome promoting cancer. In chordoma, TBXT (brachyury)&#8212;normally involved in notochord differentiation&#8212;is aberrantly expressed, resulting in promotion of cancer. As these oncogenic TFs are difficult to target directly, we and others have proposed targeting associated transcriptional regulators to inhibit their activity. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interacts with TFs to promote activation of target genes and promotes transcription elongation through phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. We have developed a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable CDK9 inhibitor, KB-0742. Here we present the preclinical activity of KB-0742 in models of sarcoma and chordoma. We first evaluated KB-0742 activity in sarcoma in a 300-immortalized cell line screen containing 18 soft tissue sarcoma cell lines. The median IC50 of the cell lines in the study was 0.8705 &#181;M. Sarcoma cell lines were enriched for sensitivity to KB-0742 with 61% (11\/18) of the lines with an IC50 below the median. The 11 cell lines had a median IC50 of 0.679 &#181;M. We then evaluated the activity of KB-0742 in 5 patient-derived cell line (PDC) models, with all 5 showing a cytotoxic response to treatment as measured by negative GRmax values. Last, a single patient-derived organoid (PDO) model of adult rhabdomyosarcoma was evaluated. KB-0742 treatment resulted in an IC50 of 2.75 &#181;M and a max inhibition rate of 98.61%. For chordoma we examined the activity of KB-0742 in vivo using 2 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. In model CF466, we observed a dose-dependent response with increased TGI and greater reductions in RNA polymerase II phosphorylation in tumors treated with KB-0742 at 60 mg\/kg as compared to 30 mg\/kg. We then evaluated KB-0742 as a single agent and in combination with afatinib in the model CF539. KB-0742 as a single agent showed similar TGI activity as afatinib, whereas the combination showed increased response as compared to the two single-agent arms.<br \/>These data show that transcriptionally addicted tumors are sensitive to CDK9 inhibition via KB-0742 treatment, and support the continued development of our compound to potentially treat sarcoma and chordoma. KB-0742 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1\/2 clinical trial (NCT04718675) for relapsed or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Once a recommended phase 2 dose is established, expansion cohorts for patients with sarcoma, chordoma, and other transcriptionally addicted tumors may be opened.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4669d910-b99a-4fb5-9c96-d270f2c278fb\/@s03B8ZDE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Chordoma,CKD9 inhibitor,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15372"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melinda A.

In contrast to non-small cell lung cancer, in which treatment advancements have shown much success, there has not been significant progress in the development of new therapies for SCLC over the last 40 years. Thus, an urgent need exists to identify new and effective pharmacological interventions for these patients.<br \/>Recent advancements in the understanding of the pathology of the disease has shown that SCLC tumorigenesis and evolution is governed by increased expression of neuroendocrine-associated and other proto-oncogenic transcription factors such as <i>ASCL1<\/i>, <i>NEUROD1<\/i>, and <i>MYC<\/i>. Thus, targeting transcription may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a serine-threonine kinase that is involved in transcriptional elongation through the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II. Additionally, CDK9 interacts with transcription factors such as <i>MYC<\/i> to promote activation of target genes. Inhibition of CDK9 results in disrupted transcriptional networks and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and survival, making CDK9 an attractive target for the treatment of SCLC. We have developed a highly selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of CDK9, KB-0742. Here we present the evaluation of KB-0742 activity in preclinical models of SCLC.<br \/>Using the Broad PRISM platform, we evaluated the sensitivity of 24 SCLC cell lines. We observed a correlation between <i>MYC<\/i> copy number amplification and sensitivity with amplified lines having smaller AUC values than non-amplified lines (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon; <i>P<\/i>&#62;0.05). We observed a similar trend of lower IC50 values with increasing levels of <i>MYC<\/i> expression in a separate cell-line screen that included 5 SCLC lines (Pearson&#8217;s correlation; <i>P<\/i>=0.71).<br \/>We then evaluated KB-0742 activity in a panel of 6 patient-derived organoid (PDO) SCLC models with different treatment histories and compared to 4 standard-of-care (SOC) compounds. KB-0742 was more active than the SOC compounds, with maximum inhibition rates of over 90% for 5 of the 6 models. In a separate study of 4 treatment-na&#239;ve PDO models, KB-0742 was active in 3 different transcription factor-driven subtypes of SCLC, and the response correlated significantly with <i>c-MYC<\/i> and <i>MYCL<\/i> expression. Lastly, we used 4 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to evaluate KB-0742 activity in vivo. The tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rate ranged from 54% to 92%, with tumor regressions observed in 2 of the 4 models, and 1 model showed greater TGI with KB-0742 than the SOC.<br \/>These data support the development of KB-0742 as a potential treatment for SCLC. Patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin lymphoma are currently being enrolled in a phase 1\/2 clinical trial of KB-0742 (NCT04718675) with an expansion arm for SCLC being planned after the recommended phase 2 dose is identified.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b6eb43e-bb89-482a-bebe-145c687972f3\/@s03B8ZDE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,CDK9,MYC,PDX,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15521"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melinda A.

Combination and monotherapy effects on proliferation and effects on downstream signaling were investigated.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RXC004 in combination with the triplet chemotherapy regimen led to significantly increased survival compared to either treatment alone (p&#60;0.005) and significant tumor volume reduction measured at Day 22 (p&#60;0.001). RXC004 in combination with the doublet chemotherapy also increased survival compared to either treatment alone (p&#60;0.05), and the combination led to significantly decreased tumor volume measured at Day 25 (p&#60;0.05). RXC004 treatment in genetically defined cell lines with RSPO fusions or RNF43 mutations led to a significant reduction in BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene expression. In in vitro proliferation studies a synergistic effect of RXC004 and a PARP inhibitor was demonstrated in genetically defined cell lines.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These data demonstrate that RXC004 in combination with clinically relevant standard of care chemotherapy regimens can lead to potential benefit over chemotherapy alone. The RXC004 induced downregulation of DNA repair pathway genes observed in vitro could contribute to the beneficial effect seen in combination with a PARP inhibitor in vitro as well as the combination effect observed in vivo with standard of care chemotherapy agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c1fec19c-ee86-4475-9500-2c62e31afa0a\/@s03B8ZDE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt pathway,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15373"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James Kelly<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Woodcock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inder Bhamra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cliff Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Armer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jane Robertson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Phillips<\/i><\/presenter>.

In human cancers, Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling is highly activated due to mutations of members associated with the pathway such as<i> <\/i>adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and &#946;-catenin. Transducin &#946;-like protein 1 (TBL1) and highly related TBLR1, form a complex with &#946;-catenin facilitating the translocation of &#946;-catenin to the nucleus. The formation of this complex protects &#946;-catenin from degradation by SIAH-1 ubiquitinase and aids &#946;-catenin binding to TCF\/LEF transcription factors to transcribe downstream Wnt target genes. We recently reported that the destruction of the TBL1\/&#946;-catenin complex using a small molecule results in ubiquitination of &#946;-catenin and inhibition of downstream signaling. As an alternative approach, we designed a series of novel peptides to interfere with binding of &#946;-catenin with TBL1.<br \/>Methods: Homologous competitive ELISA and thermal shift assays were performed to identify potential peptides that were able to displace &#946;-catenin from TBL1. Additionally, we evaluated the ability of the peptides to disrupt the TBL1\/&#946;-catenin complex by performing pull-down assays and monitored the levels of &#946;-catenin ubiquitination in response to peptide treatment in colon cell lines. To assess the levels of TCF\/LEF transcriptional activation downstream the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway, we performed TOPFlash assays in Wnt-activated cells transfected with plasmids for peptide expression.<br \/>Results: Our preliminary results identified a set of peptides that efficiently displaces &#946;-catenin from TBL1. Homologous competitive ELISA showed that the peptides were able to displace &#946;-catenin from TBL1 in a dose dependent manner. The top five peptide hits were then tested for their ability to inhibit Wnt signaling using the TOPFlash assay. Among these, one peptide in particular showed high efficiency in inhibiting TCF\/LEF transcriptional activation downstream the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway. Our study suggests that &#946;-catenin therapeutic peptides may represent a new and exciting approach for Wnt driven cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bce9ea73-9484-45ff-89a6-f88e64bd98db\/@s03B8ZDE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt pathway,&#946;-catenin,Peptides,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15374"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shelby Rheinschmidt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trason Thode<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Sampson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexis Weston<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tithi Ghosh Halder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Serina Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Rodriguez del Villar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohan Kaadige<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anton Zernov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcelle Machluf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raffaella Soldi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunil Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cancer cell lines with high expression level of cyclin E1 gene exhibited profound sensitivity to CDK2 gene depletion, suggesting CDK2 selective inhibitors have the potential to treat patients harboring Cyclin E1 alterations. Here we report the development and preclinical characterization of ARTS-021, an orally bioavailable small molecule CDK2 selective inhibitor. In enzymatic assay against a panel of different CDKs, ARTS-021 potently inhibits the activity of CDK2\/CyclinE1 complex with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the sub-nanomolar range, displaying superior selectivity against other CDKs (CDK1,4,6,7,9). Very low hit rate (S(10)=0.022, at 1uM) is observed when ARTS-021 is assessed in whole Kinome profiling, further revealing the selectivity of this compound. ARTS-021 also demonstrates potent CDK2 inhibition and selectivity against other CDK family members (CDK1,4,6,9) in a series of cellular assays. Consistent with genetic CDK2 dependence data, cell lines with CCNE1 amplification are particularly sensitive to ARTS-021. Double nanomolar ARTS-021 inhibits Rb phosphorylation and blocks G1\/S transition, leading to cell growth arrest specifically in CCNE1 amplified cell lines. This CDK2 dependent anti-tumor activity is further validated in vivo, where daily ARTS-021 administration leads to tumor stasis in CCNE1 amplified but not wild type xenograft models. Taken together, these data demonstrate ARTS-021 as a promising CDK2 selective inhibitor with strong potential towards the development of effective therapies for CCNE1 altered cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3eca2446-7159-491d-96ae-cf6c9b2857f8\/@s03B8ZDE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK2,Cyclin E,Inhibitors,cell cycle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15375"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jiaqi Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dai Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yali Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaobin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xipan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jia Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiang Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen Xiong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yaoyu Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Qing Sheng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Within this pathway, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and Aurora kinase A (AurA) have key roles. PDK1 is a phosphorylation-mediated activator of Akt, the main apoptotic regulator, thereby acting at the crossroads of several oncogenic pathways. Overexpression and\/or aberrant activation of AurA have been functionally linked to neoplastic transformation principally through the development of centrosome amplification and chromosomal instability. In this study, the molecular mechanisms involved in the dual inhibitory capacity of PDK1- and AurA-targeting OXID-pyridonyl compounds were explored in a panel of tumor cell lines carrying PI3KCA, K-RAS, PTEN, RB-1, EGFR and\/or TP53 mutations<br \/><b>Materials and Methods.<\/b> To evaluate the enzymatic inhibitory activity, the oxindole-based derivatives were subjected to FRET-based Z&#8242;-Lyte assay (Invitrogen&#8482;) against PDK1 and AurA. All in vitro assays for ADME-Tox profiling were performed as published previously[1]. Anti-proliferative effects of OXID-pyridonyl compounds (SA16, IB35, VI8, VI18) were assessed by soft agar clonogenic formation and MTT assays after 72-h exposures with increasing concentrations (from 0.014 to 30 &#181;M) in a panel of 15 cell lines. Protein levels were analyzed by Western Blot using commercial antibodies. OSU-03012 (PDK-1 inhibitor) and MK-5108 (AurA inhibitor) were used as reference compounds.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> Among the four evaluated compounds, SA16 displayed nanomolar inhibitory potency against both PDK1 and AurA. In vitro, drugs SA16 and VI8 showed to exert anti-tumor activity in the 6647, TC71, SKNMC Ewing sarcoma (ES) cells lines and in the HCT116 colon carcinoma-derived cells (IC50s values between 2.6 and 25 &#181;M after 72-h exposures), when tested in a panel of 15 cancer cell lines. These results were confirmed by the evaluation of 3D-clonogenic capacity in soft agar. The effect of 1 &#181;M SA16 at the protein level was evaluated after 5 to 120 min exposure in the ES cell line SKNMC. No modulation of Aur-A protein or PDK-1 phosphorylation (Ser241) were observed in SKNMC cells, whereas a decrease of downstream PDK1 targets such as p-AKT, p-RSK2, and p-p44\/42 MAPK was observed after 30 min of exposure. In addition, SA16 displayed acceptable in vitro ADME-Tox properties. Our results on structural insights into the mode of binding[2], in vitro drug-intake kinetics and in vivo PK appear to indicate that SA16 presents adequate features as a scaffold for the design of PDK1\/AurA dual-target molecules.<br \/><b>Conclusion.<\/b> We report the synthesis of novel first-in-class 2-oxindole-based derivatives as dual PDK1-AurA kinase inhibitors as a novel scaffold for the design and synthesis of a new multitarget strategy for Ewing sarcoma.[1] Runfola M. et al.

Inhibition of WEE1 could result in premature progression through the G2\/M cell cycle checkpoint with unresolved DNA damage, leading to mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Small molecule WEE1 inhibitors, such as AZD1775 and Zn-C3, are currently being evaluated in the clinic and have demonstrated promising efficacy in solid tumors including ovarian, colon, and uterine carcinoma.<br \/>By applying Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s computational platform including Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) and Protein FEP, we have identified novel, potent, and highly selective WEE1 inhibitors with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the low nanomolar range in a biochemical kinase activity assay and cellular target engagement (CDK1 pTyr15) IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of 100 - 300 nM in A427 and OVCAR3 cell lines. The compounds also show potent anti-proliferative activity in over 20 breast and ovarian tumor cell lines, including cell lines insensitive to PARP inhibitors. The compounds demonstrate superior kinase selectivity compared to AZD1775 and Zn-C3 in a broad kinase panel with &#62;450 kinases (ScanMAX). In addition, the compounds show desirable ADME properties and PK profiles in preclinical species. Based on in vitro CYP3A4 TDI assay performance (k<sub>inact<\/sub>\/K<sub>I<\/sub>), we have reduced the potential for drug-drug interaction liabilities compared to AZD1775. In the A427 xenograft model, our WEE1 inhibitors demonstrate dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and tumor regression at high doses. Anti-tumor activity is also demonstrated in additional tumor models, including OVCAR3 and HCC1806 xenograft models. The established PK-PD relationship shows sustained target engagement (pCDK1), increased DNA damage (gH2AX) and mitosis (pHH3). We demonstrate that hematological adverse effects can be mitigated by dosing holidays in xenograft tumor models while maintaining anti-tumor activity. Notably, our compound shows more sustained anti-tumor activity with dosing holidays compared to AZD1775, which we believe is attributable to the prolonged and higher exposure in tumor and plasma with our compound. In the A427 non small-cell lung cancer xenograft model, following 3 dosing holiday cycles at high doses, tumor eradication was maintained after treatment was stopped.

In HPV-negative tumors, CDKN2A (p16) inactivation or CCND1 (cyclin D1) amplification frequently occurs resulting in sustained cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4\/6 activation. The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy of PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway inhibitors (PI3Ki) (alpelisib, buparlisib and gedatolisib) and CDK4\/6 inhibitors (CDKi) (palbociclib and ribociclib) in HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC cell lines.<br \/>Methods: The efficacy of the inhibitors was assessed using MTT assays and changes in PI3K and Cyclin D1\/CDK pathway protein expression were determined by Western blotting. Cell cycle analysis was performed with flow cytometry and apoptosis was assessed by Annexin-V staining. Changes in cell metabolism were assessed by Seahorse XF assays.<br \/>Results: Both HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC cell lines were highly sensitive to the PI3Ki (Gedatolisib, IC50 5-30 nM &#62; Buparlisib, IC50 0.6-3.6 &#181;M &#62; Alpelisib, IC50 3-23 &#181;M). In general, PI3Ki decreased pathway activity, resulted in moderate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and decreased oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. CDKi were particularly effective in blocking HPV-negative cell line growth (Palbociclib, IC50 0.5-2 &#181;M &#62; Ribociclib, IC50 4-7 &#181;M). CDK inhibition showed decreased pRb expression and G1 cell cycle arrest, whereas apoptosis was not induced.<br \/>Conclusion: PI3Ki and CDKi efficiently inhibit their respective pathways and HNSCC cell growth in vitro, the latter only in HPV-negative cell lines. Whereas PI3Ki especially show an effect on oxidative and glycolytic metabolism, CDKi particularly lead to cell cycle arrest. Further research should elucidate whether these inhibitors may be effective therapeutic agents in HNSCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/217815f7-1b29-4941-8314-d7ef39eac5c1\/@s03B8ZDE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Squamous cell carcinoma,PI3K inhibitors,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15497"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Imke Demers<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Femke Verhees<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dion Leegemaate<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robin Jacobs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ann Hoeben<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Hoebers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernd Kremer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ernst-Jan Speel<\/i><\/presenter>.

Q901 is an irreversible small molecule inhibitor with extreme selectivity and potent inhibition activity for CDK7, which forms a covalent bond with C312 of the CDK7 C-terminal domain. Q901 demonstrated selective cytotoxic activities in a broad spectrum of solid tumor lineages. TP53 mutation could be a potential predictive marker for the Q901 response as TP53 wild-type cancer cells demonstrates a significantly increased cytotoxic response compared to TP53 mutant cells in the bioinformatic analysis. In addition, gene expression profiling analysis showed a dose-response increase of POLR2A expression upon Q901 treatment and a correlation with tumor growth inhibition rate, indicating that POLR2A might be a potential PD marker for the Q901-induced response. Taken together, these data support the clinical development of Q901 for solid tumor indications.

Preclinical studies in glioblastoma (GBM) have shown that avanbulin is also active in human cancer cells resistant to other MTAs used in the clinic. Lisavanbulin (BAL101553) is a water-soluble, oral, lysine prodrug of avanbulin, currently in phase 1\/2 for patients with recurrent GBM and, in combination with radiotherapy, for newly diagnosed GBM patients. Preclinical studies and clinical signals have also suggested an association between lisavanbulin activity and expression of microtubule plus-end binding protein (EB1). MTAs are active agents for lymphoma patients, as exemplified by the inclusion of vincristine in the R-CHOP regimen, standard treatment for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Thus, our aim was to evaluate avanbulin, the active moiety of lisavanbulin, for its potential anti-lymphoma activity.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Lymphoma<b> <\/b>cell lines derived from activated B cell like (ABC) and germinal center B cell type (GCB) DLBCL were exposed to increasing doses of avanbulin; cell proliferation was measured with MTT. Apoptosis induction was performed with annexin V staining on cells incubated in a live cell imaging system (Incucyte) treated with 5, 10, 20 or 40nM avanbulin. Images were taken every 4h for 72h. Cell cycle analysis was performed after 24, 48 and 72h of drug exposure at 20nM.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 26 DLBCL cell lines, treated for 72h with increasing avanbulin doses, showed high anti-proliferative activity of the compound, with a median IC50 = 11nM. No differences in terms of IC50 were observed comparing ABC (n=8) to GCB (n=18) DLBCLs, nor based on <i>MYD88<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>BCL2<\/i> status. Cell lines with MYC translocation were less sensitive than the ones without translocation. All lymphoma cell lines exhibited high EB1 RNA expression, with no correlation with sensitivity to avanbulin.Live cell imaging demonstrated a strong apoptosis induction in 15 out of 17 cell lines tested at 20 and 40nM. Among the 15 cell lines undergoing apoptosis, 8 cell lines already showed an apoptosis induction within 24h of drug exposure, 6 lines between 24 and 48h and 1 line after 48h exposure. These data confirmed the high activity of avanbulin already seen with the MTT assay.Cell cycle experiments performed at 24, 48 and 72h confirmed the strong cytotoxic effect of avanbulin in 4 DLBCL cell lines, including 2 ABC (OCILY3 and TMD8) and 2 GCB (SUDHL5 and SUDHL16) lines. Sub-G0 accumulation was already present at 24h in all 4 cell lines tested, with an increase over time. Especially at 24h, where we also observed a G2-M arrest in 3 out of 4 cell lines.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data demonstrate the high cytotoxic anti-lymphoma activity of avanbulin, suggesting a potential activity of its prodrug lisavanbulin in lymphoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6b3c9ce3-7d64-4a3d-a8e0-940606384b52\/@t03B8ZDF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-10 Tubulin agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Prodrugs,Microtubule-interfering agents,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15524"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Filippo Spriano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Aresu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luciano Cascione<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto J.

Degradation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) into adenosine by CD73 results in the generation of an immunosuppressed and pro-angiogenic niche within the TME that promotes the onset and progression of cancer. Targeting CD73 has resulted in favourable anti-tumor effects in preclinical models and in clinic. One of the key mechanisms of therapeutic activity by CD73 inhibition is restoring the normal function of effector T cells from adenosine inhibition. ATG-037 is a highly potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of CD73. This study compared the ability of ATG-037 and clinical CD73 antibodies in reverting immunosuppression in higher-AMP environments <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The activity of ATG-037 and CD73 antibodies (Hu101-28, MEDI9447) in inhibiting enzyme function of cell surface CD73 was evaluated by measuring the ATP-dependent oxidation of luciferin, which is inhibited by AMP, using Cell Titer Glo assay. Reversal of AMP\/adenosine-mediated immune suppression of human T cells by CD73 inhibitors was determined by measuring T cell function in the presence of different concentrations of exogenous AMP. Markers for T cell proliferation, activation and cytotoxicity were assessed by flow cytometry, and the cytokine levels were measured by ELISA.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> ATG-037, Hu101-28 and MEDI9447 inhibited the enzyme activity of cell surface-expressed CD73 on human A375 cells under 100 &#181;M AMP with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) of 0.36 nM,20.94 nM and 3.46 nM, respectively. ATG-037 demonstrated complete inhibition of CD73 activity, whereas MEDI9447 did not reach complete CD73 inhibition. T cell proliferation and activation induced by CD3\/CD28 dynabeads were suppressed by 100 &#181;M of extracellular AMP and the suppression was relieved by the addition of ATG-037 with half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50<\/sub>) of 21.6 nM for CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell proliferation, 27 nM for T cell activation, 2 nM for granzyme B expression, and 6.5 nM for T cell IFN-&#947; production. While Hu101-28 and MEDI9447 fail to restore the T cell function. In a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, ATG-037, but not Hu101-28 or MEDI9447 reversed AMP-dependent T cell suppression. In addition, ATG-037 rescued immune cell activation in high AMP (500 &#181;M, 1000 &#181;M) environments.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>ATG-037 demonstrated potent and complete CD73 enzyme inhibition and stronger ability in restoring T cell function from high-level AMP mediated suppression, compared with clinical anti-CD73 antibodies.

Targeted therapies, such as hormonotherapy or immunotherapy, including checkpoint inhibitors, have revolutionized cancer treatment and are effective for most breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, some patients do not benefit from these therapies and development of resistance might lead to cancer progression in patients with primary clinical responses. Therefore, resistance to checkpoint inhibitor (e.g., PD-1\/PD-L) blockade remains a significant challenge and impedes their broader application. To overcome this limitation, development of new therapeutic solutions to improve efficacy and clinical response is essential. We have demonstrated that a selective inhibitor (ITI-214) of the phosphodiesterase type 1 (PDE1) enzyme [Li et al. J Med Chem. 2016;59:1149] modulates immune cell function (microglia and macrophages) by altering cell migration and key cytokines (mainly CCL2 and TNF-&#945;) [O&#8217;Brien et al. MCN. 2020;102:103449]. We hypothesized that ITI-214 will affect macrophage infiltration and polarization, as well as improve T cell recruitment and function into the tumor microenvironment, thereby promoting antitumor immunity in murine cancer models. Here we have tested this hypothesis by studying the effect of ITI-214, alone or in combination with sub-effective doses of a programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, in a syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer. We measured effects of ITI-214 (+\/-anti-PD-1 antibody, 10 mpk) on tumor growth, tumor microenvironment composition, and survival of E0771 tumor-bearing C57Bl\/6 mice. Tumor growth in mice treated with ITI-214 or with anti-PD-1 antibody alone was similar to isotype control. However, significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in mice receiving ITI-214 and anti-PD-1 in combination compared to control. Flow cytometry analysis of the tumor microenvironment showed no change in the number of tumor macrophages or T cells in the combination group, but significant shift in the polarization of macrophages toward a more inflammatory phenotype. Furthermore, RNAseq analysis of tumors treated with combination therapy showed a reduction in genes from pathways involved in cell cycle and proliferation and an increase in genes from inflammatory and immune response pathways. The results suggest that ITI-214, in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, promotes antitumor immunity, leading to tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, we have evidence that these observations are driven by tumor-associated macrophages. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a synergistic ability of ITI-214 and anti-PD-1 to alter the tumor microenvironment and control tumor growth in mice. Translating these findings to the clinic suggests that ITI-214 may provide a means to expand the utility of immune checkpoint inhibitors to treatment-refractory tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eb536c10-45b3-40e7-b5f6-bdd133f2b9bb\/@t03B8ZDF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Immunotherapy,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15527"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maud Voisin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Goding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gretchen L.

However, only a minority of patient derive benefit, suggesting the implication of additional key determinants of ICB-mediated response in TLS-positive sarcomas, such as TLS composition. Using high-throughput spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunofluorescence (IHF), we aimed at investigating the association between TLS composition and clinical outcome to ICB.<br \/>Methods: In an exploratory cohort, we spatially profiled the expression of more than 18000-protein encoding genes from responders (R) and non-responders (NR) using Nanostring&#8217;s GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) assay. A first set of regions of interest (ROI) was selected in the TLS and further segmented in &#8220;B-cells&#8221; vs &#8220;no B-cells&#8221; areas according to CD20+ staining; a second set of ROI was selected in the tumor tissue and further segmented into &#8220;tumor&#8221; vs &#8220;stroma&#8221; areas according to CD45+ staining. Deconvolution of data was performed using SpatialDecon algorithm to estimate cell population within TLS. We then evaluated the association between immune cell composition and response to ICB in each segment. In a validation cohort, we performed multiplexed-IHF assay enabling detection of T cells (CD8\/GzmA\/CD4\/FoxP3\/CD56) and B cells. These panel was applied to whole sections baseline sarcoma samples. We investigated the association between immune cell composition and clinical benefit in term of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: Six patients were selected for the exploratory cohort, including 3 R and 3 NR. Among the top immune cell infiltrate within TLS segment, NR demonstrated higher Treg infiltrate versus R in &#8220;no B-cells&#8221; compartment (3.4% vs 2.0%, respectively; p=0.010), whereas no association was observed between Treg infiltration and response to ICB in both stromal (p=0.67) or tumor cells (p=0.36) compartments from tumor area. In the validation cohort (N=16), we observed that Treg density within TLS was higher in NR versus R (p=0.0059). Patients with Treg-enriched TLS had shorter PFS (2.6 vs 11.1 months, p=0.042) and OS (9.0 vs 18.3 months, p=0.12) compared to those with Treg-low TLS infiltration. Concordantly, the CTLA-4 key Treg regulator gene was upregulated in the TLS regions from NR.<br \/>Conclusions: Altogether, our findings suggest that the presence of Treg within TLS may exert a negative influence on the capacity of TLS to generate an effective antitumor immune response in sarcoma patients treated with ICB, providing new insights in understanding role of TLS in antitumor immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7f505bed-8d72-4905-9572-b3269ea7f915\/@t03B8ZDF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Regulatory T cells,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15529"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Florent Peyraud<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Philippe Guegan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Rey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Pulido<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emmanuelle Bompas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Piperno-Neumann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Chevreau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Penel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>François Bertucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maud Toulmonde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carine Bellera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Sautès-Fridman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Bougoüin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Coralie Cantarel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michèle Kind<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariella Spalato-Ceruso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bérengère Dadone-Montaudie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Yves Blay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wolf Herman Fridman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>François Le Loarer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alban Bessede<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Italiano<\/i><\/presenter>.

Featuring an antibody-based targeting domain fused with the cytotoxic, ribosome inactivating Shiga-like toxin A subunit (SLTA), ETBs enable killing of target expressing cells. Although immunotoxins have been explored for decades as promising cancer therapeutics, activation of innate immunity limited this approach. MTEM has developed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation ETBs with iterative improvements to reduce immunogenicity and add mechanisms of action. Here, we describe the development of an ex vivo cytokine release assay used to enhance the safety, tolerance, and therapeutic index (TI) of ETBs as cancer therapeutics. MT-3724, a 1st gen CD20 targeting ETB comprising wild type SLTA (WT SLTA) genetically fused to a CD20 targeting scFv, displayed efficacy as monotherapy in relapsed\/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, a subset of MT-3724-treated patients experienced capillary leak syndrome (CLS), likely driven by innate immune recognition of specific components of WT SLTA. Adverse events were also associated with a particular lot of MT-3724 that contained a higher proportion of aggregated species. Therefore, next gen ETBs were de-immunized by replacing surface exposed residues of WT SLTA while retaining cytotoxicity and were designed to have reduced propensity for aggregation. An ex vivo cytokine release assay, developed to triage candidate ETBs that generate innate immune activation, was validated by probing WT-SLTA and aggregated MT-3724. Cancer free human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or PBMCs depleted of B cells were treated with positive and negative controls, non-targeted SLTAs, and ETBs. Cytokine concentrations were quantified by Luminex. The positive control TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated robust release of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1&#946;, TNF&#945;, and IL-6, as well as CCL3, CCL4, GM-CSF, IL-10, IFN&#947;, and Granzyme B. Non-targeted WT SLTA displayed a similar, but not identical, pattern of cytokine release. Conversely, the de-immunized (DI) SLTA did not activate cytokine or chemokine release, remaining at levels equal to PBS, indicating that scrubbing WT SLTA of immunogenic components can improve the safety profile and TI of our 2nd gen ETBs. Aggregated MT-3724 induced moderate increases in TNF&#945;, IL-6, CCL3, and CCL4 relative to a non-aggregated MT-3724 lot. Removal of B cells from PBMCs did not alter cytokine release patterns of LPS, WT SLTA, or aggregated MT-3724. These data suggest that cytokines were released in response to WT SLTA and protein aggregates in an off-target manner. This assay will be used to evaluate ETB safety by testing candidate ETBs for likelihood of cytokine release and\/or innate immune activation prior to selection as candidates for clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6683d4a-5bcb-4c55-94b6-b94fbed8d56f\/@t03B8ZDF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotoxin,Innate immunity,Cytokines,Safety,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15530"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachael M.

Immunotherapy is a promising treatment for SCC. However, only a small proportion of unselected SCC patients are able to achieve durable clinical benefit. We leveraged the precious specimens from S1400I trial and sought to explore whether the levels and spatial distributions of tumor-associated immune cells (TAICs) in screening samples are associated with PFS, and OS.<br \/>Methods: We utilized paraffin tumor tissue provided by the SWOG bank from screening on LungMAP. 82\/252 eligible SCC sample from patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (nivo+ipi; n = 35) or with nivolumab alone (nivo; n = 47) were studied. Image analysis tissue immunoprofiling was conducted using 9 markers in 2 multiplex immunofluorescence panels against cytokeratin, CD3, CD8, granzyme B, CD45RO, and FOXP3, PD1, PD-L1, and CD68. Densities of cells phenotypes (cells\/mm2) were assessed and dichotomized as being high (&#62; median) or low (&#8804; median) in tumor, stroma, and total compartments. Distances from malignant cells (MCs) to cell populations were measured and dichotomized as close from MCs (&#8804; median) and faraway from MCs (&#62; median) and associated with clinical variables. Clinicopathologic features and data on PFS, and OS were retrieved from the CIDC portal as provided by the LungMap team. Non-parametric tests where utilized to assessment associations of cell phenotypes versus continue or categorical variables and log-rank test for survival analysis.<br \/>Results: Univariate analysis showed that higher densities of memory T cells in total compartment (HR:0.63, CI:0.40-1.00, P=0.041), antigen-experienced T cells in the stroma (HR:0.60, CI:0.37-0.96, P=0.024) and total compartment (HR:0.60, CI:0.38-0.95, P=0.023) and activated cytotoxic T cells in the tumor compartment (HR:0.55, CI:0.35-0.87, P=0.011) were associated with significative better PFS. In the nivo+ipi arm, higher ratios of cytotoxic T cells to regulatory T cells in the stroma were associated with better PFS. The spatial analysis of these TAICs showed that the presence of activated cytotoxic T cells close to the MCs (median, &#8804;19.27 &#181;m) was associated with better PFS (P=0.037).<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that patients who have a detectable immunosuppressive tumor axis (PD-L1\/PD1) with adequate activated cytotoxic T cells close to the tumor cells are the ideal patients for immune therapy to be targetable with these types of treatments.<br \/>Acknowledgments:<b> <\/b>Scientific and financial support for: U10CA180888, U10CA180819U24CA224285, U24CA224316, PACT, PPP and FNIH.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5827b4dd-aa42-4e58-9792-4414c82b8379\/@t03B8ZDF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Squamous cell carcinoma,Multiplex Immunofluorescence ,Cellular spatial distribution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15531"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Edwin Roger Parra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiexin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Redman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rossana Lazcano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Piubelli Mario<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caddie Laberiano Fernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renganayaki K.

IL-15 is currently in clinical trial either alone or as an adjuvant for certain types of metastatic solid tumors. Systemic administration of IL-15 is associated with severe toxicities including hemodynamic imbalance, lymphopenia, and other cytokine-related complications. We hypothesized that tumor targeted delivery of IL-15 using MSCs can&#8239; improve efficacy and reduce toxicity&#8239; associated with IL-15.&#8239; MSCs were engineered to express IL-15 using a lentiviral system (pLenti-C-Myc-DDK-P2A-Puro vector; Invitrogen) tagged with C-terminal MYC\/DDK tag for easy detection and purification with anti-DDK antibody. We achieved stable transfection of IL-15 in MSCs (5.7 ng\/10<sup>6<\/sup> MSCs in 24 hrs; ELISA). Bioactivity of secreted IL-15 was confirmed by splenocyte proliferation assay. We then tested the anticancer activity of IL-15 secreting MSCs in a syngeneic LL\/2 lung cancer model. Animals treated with IL-15 secreting MSCs demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to mice treated with IL-15 alone. It was further demonstrated that IL-15 expressing MSCs enhance tumor infiltration of various immune cells. These studies demonstrate the potential of developing novel MSC-based immunotherapy constructs with reduced toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ce5696c1-b95f-4278-bfd4-52e59035e34e\/@t03B8ZDF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal stem cell,Immunotherapy,Natural killer cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15532"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Drishti Sehgal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>No'ad Shanas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swayam Prabha<\/i><\/presenter>.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the liver play a central role in maintaining the tolerogenic local immune environment, both in homeostasis and disease. Here we sought to explore the impact of CBI on hepatic Tregs to determine if they play a role in CBI resistance of liver tumors in mice.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: High-dimensional flow cytometry was used to examine the <i>ex vivo<\/i> characteristics of lymphocytes from both tumor-free and orthotopic tumor-bearing livers of mice treated with CBI or other immunomodulatory agents.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: All hepatic T cell subsets examined displayed higher proliferative and apoptotic indices compared with those of splenic T lymphocytes. We found that hepatic Tregs intensely proliferate and undergo apoptosis compared with splenic Tregs under homeostatic conditions. Hepatic Treg proliferation was enhanced after administration of CBI treatment. This effect was abrogated by co-treatment with sirolimus.

PBMC- or CD34-humanized mouse models are invaluable tools to assess effector functions of human T-cells to immune check point inhibitors (ICI). However, these models offer limited understanding of the overall potential therapeutic activity as they lack a complete repertoire of human immune cells required to elicit a full immune response. Thus, the development of multigenic humanized <i>knock-in<\/i> models provide a unique approach to evaluate the efficacy of ICI specific for human cancer targets in a fully immunocompetent organism. Here we describe the response of the EMT-6 murine breast cancer tumor model to ipilimumab and pembrolizumab in a novel <i>hPDCD1\/hCTLA4-KI<\/i> double knock-in humanized BALB\/c mouse model. EMT-6 tumors were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of <i>hPDCD1\/hCTLA4-KI <\/i>mice. Three days post-implant we initiated treatment with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab alone and in combination. We observed significant ipilimumab anti-tumor activity, whereas pembrolizumab did not show efficacy despite effective T-cell PD-1 blockade. Unexpectedly, sudden respiratory distress occurred in animals receiving the 4<sup>th<\/sup> dose of combination therapy and the treatment was discontinued. To assess the immune phenotypic profiles in response to ipilimumab and\/or pembrolizumab therapies, we performed multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood, spleens and tumors. Additionally, we performed histopathological evaluation of lung tissues to assess potential neutrophil infiltration-mediated anaphylaxis in the mice treated with the combination treatment. The preliminary results highlight the value of the <i>hPDCD1\/hCTLA4-KI <\/i>double knock-in humanized Balb\/c model as a tool to evaluate human-specific immune-checkpoint based modalities. These models represent some of the difficulties faced in treating refractory tumors as well as reproducing some of the adverse effects seen in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/97c76307-1a02-494a-bb78-602029e005cb\/@t03B8ZDF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ipilimumab,Preclinical testing,Pembrolizumab,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15536"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Murray Stackhouse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariah Kuta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Kolb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sydney Scatigno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amber Blackwell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chassidy Hall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Dowdy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Payel Sil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Gietl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steve Festin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Paula L.

The Fc&#947;R binds to the Fc region of an antibody that is attached to target cells, transmitting an activation or inhibition signal to the Fc&#947;R expressing cells, resulting in various biological responses and functions. Many therapeutic antibodies are developed based on the engineering of the Fc region to fine-tune the Fc&#947;R mediated effects.<br \/>There are four subtypes of mouse Fc&#947;Rs, including Fcgr1, Fcgr2b, Fcgr3, and Fcgr4. In contrast, human Fc&#947;Rs consist of at least seven members, including FCGR1A, FCGR1B, FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR2C, FCGR3A, and FCGR3B. Additionally, the expression pattern of even the orthologous Fc&#947;R genes varies between humans and mice. e.g., the distribution of mouse FCGR3 and FCGR2. Therefore, animals harboring the murine Fc&#947;Rs are not ideal models for the accurate preclinical evaluation of human therapeutic antibodies. To address this problem, we established an Fc&#947;Rs fully humanized mouse model by injecting an engineered human bacterial artificial chromosome construct carrying all seven human Fc&#947;R genes into mouse zygotes. The transgene carriers were mated with another strain in which all mouse Fc&#947;R genes were knocked out to establish the colony.<br \/>Unlike the endogenous mouse Fc&#947;R genes expression profiles, the transgenic human Fc&#947;R genes regulated under the control of the human control elements retain the human expression pattern. For example, the transgenic human FCGR3A was observed on mouse NK cells and macrophages, whereas the FCGR3B was detected on mouse neutrophils only, which were consistent with their expression patterns in humans. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) experiment indicated that a human therapeutic antibody could direct NK cells derived from the Fc&#947;Rs fully-humanized mice to kill target tumor cells. Moreover, a significant anti-tumor effect could also be achieved by an ADCC based human antibody in tumor-bearing Fc&#947;Rs humanized mice.<br \/>Taken together, the Fc&#947;R gene fully-humanized model established in this study demonstrates a human Fc&#947;R expression pattern and functionality, thus providing a valuable tool for accurate preclinical evaluation of human therapeutic antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b996de4f-9727-4082-9c05-227156d9cf35\/@t03B8ZDF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),FCGR3A (CD16A),Humanized Mouse,Fc gamma receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15537"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mingkun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunxiang Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunlong Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiwei Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Zhiying Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Gao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a promising target for anticancer immunotherapy. However, dysregulated STING expression, or poor pharmacokinetic profiles of STING agonists pose major challenges. Recently, modulating target protein levels via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, such as proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), has broadened the scope of pharmacological inventions. Herein, we propose UPPRIS (upregulation of target proteins by protein-protein interaction strategy) to overcome these limitations. We discovered the small molecule SB24011 that inhibits STING-E3 ligase interaction, thereby induces the blockade of E3 ligase-mediated STING degradation. As a result, SB24011 enhanced the STING agonist-mediated immune responses by upregulating cellular STING protein level. Thus, co-administration of SB24011 markedly improved the immuno-oncological efficacy of STING agonist cGAMP and anti-PD-1 therapy for tumor regression and robust systemic antitumor response. Taken together, we successfully demonstrated that targeted STING protein upregulation is a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6fa4f006-39fa-4884-ac14-81b501f68e66\/@u03B8ZDG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule drugs,Immunotherapy,Chemistry,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15539"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wansang Cho<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Solchan Won<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoona Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jong Beom Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun-Gyu Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sihyeong Yi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline E.
