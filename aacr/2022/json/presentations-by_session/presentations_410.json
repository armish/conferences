[{"Abstract":"While inhibition of androgen receptor signaling has greatly improved the outcome for many prostate cancer patients (PCa), there are limited therapeutic interventions for advanced and metastatic PCa. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is activated by cellular stress and regulates transcription, proteome stability, and oxidative stress. HSF1 is elevated in aggressive cancers from many tissue types and has been directly implicated in driving cancer progression. We found that HSF1 predicts survival for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients, who are unable to be treated by inhibition of the androgen receptor signaling. In comparison to benign prostate tissue, HSF1 had increased protein levels in primary PCa, castration resistant PCa, and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma the most aggressive histologic type of PCa. Knockdown of HSF1 decreases cellular growth in PCa cell lines. In collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Dennis Thiele, we identified a direct HSF inhibitor that targets nuclear HSF1 for degradation. Prostate cancer cells experience cellular senescence when treated with the HSF1 inhibitor. To better understand how HSF1 regulates PCa cellular growth, we investigated metabolic changes in response to the selective HSF1 inhibitor. We found that a rate limiting enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway was reproducibly altered after HSF1 knockdown and pharmacological inhibition. This is the first linkage of HSF1 and the transsulfuration pathway in cancer. The transsulfuration pathway is important for production of cellular energy in the form of pyruvate, so overactive HSF1 likely increases cellular growth through increased pyruvate production. The transsulfuration pathways also produces the antioxidant hydrogen sulfide. The increased production of antioxidants likely aid cancer cells in responding to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that form in cancer cells from oncogene activation, decreased blood supply, and tumor hypoxia. We have identified novel HSF1 binding sites in the gene encoding this transsulfuration pathway enzyme, which regulate levels of gene expression. Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma cells treated with both the selective HSF1 inhibitor and the transsulfuration pathway inhibitor have reduced growth and increased cellular death by caspase 3 cleavage. Targeting the transsulfuration pathway in combination with HSF1 inhibition may delay recurrence in PCa patients by killing tumor cells instead of solely inducing cellular senescence. Since HSF1 is increased in many forms of cancer, these data may provide novel therapeutic targets for aggressive cancer from many tissue types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/98889799-9cf5-43ba-b116-0bbfecf6cd96\/@D03B8ZJ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Oxidative stress,Heat shock proteins,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12450"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>J.

Cachectic wasting cannot be abrogated by nutritional supplementation, and the mechanisms underlying this phenotype are unclear. Recent work demonstrates that human antigen R (HuR), an RNA-binding protein that regulates expression of genes involved in key cellular processes such as inflammation, stress response, and apoptosis, is also a major repressor of adipogenesis. Thus, we sought to elucidate the relative contributions of enhanced catabolism and impaired anabolism on fat wasting by investigating adipose tissue response to different nutritional contexts and HuR inhibition in cachectic mice.<br \/>Methods: Adult C57BL\/6J mice received orthotopic PDAC tumor injections (<i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>; p53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup>; Pdx1-cre<\/i>) or sham injections. Mice were fed ad libitum, fasted 24h or fasted and refed 24h at mid-cachexia (9 days after injection). A separate cohort of PDAC mice were treated with the HuR inhibitor KH3 (100 mg\/kg) at 6-, 8-, and 10-days post-injection and subjected to the same fast\/refeed paradigm. Gross fat pads were weighed to assess anabolism. Adipose tissue mRNA levels were measured using RNAseq and validated with qPCR. Lipolytic rate was quantified as normalized quantity of glycerol released from inguinal (iWAT) and gonadal (gWAT) fat pads <i>ex vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: PDAC and control mice exhibited equivalent loss of adipose tissue as a result of food restriction. Fat pads from PDAC mice displayed decreased lipolysis <i>ex vivo<\/i> and decreased lipase (<i>Atgl &#38; Lipe<\/i>) mRNA expression. In the fast\/refeed model, PDAC mice were unable to restore iWAT or gWAT mass after refeed compared to controls. RNAseq revealed 614 differentially expressed genes between gWAT from PDAC and control mice. Downregulated (n=111) genes were most closely associated with adipogenesis (adj p=5x10<sup>-3<\/sup>), and expression of adipogenesis master regulators <i>Pparg<\/i> and <i>Cebpa<\/i> were reduced in both iWAT and gWAT from PDAC mice. Inhibition of HuR by KH3 restored lipogenesis in refed animals with a concomitant increase in fat pad mass and associated genes regulating adipogenesis (<i>Pparg<\/i>, <i>Cebpa<\/i>, <i>Retn<\/i>, <i>Adipoq<\/i>, <i>Fasn<\/i>).<br \/>Conclusion: Adipose tissue wasting during PDAC cachexia can result from impaired anabolism in the absence of excess lipolysis or malabsorption. Adipose anabolism in PDAC mice is mediated by increased HuR activity in adipocytes. Restoring anabolic potential in adipose tissue using the HuR inhibitor KH3 may provide a novel approach to alleviating PDAC cachexia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ece73cf-eb4e-4e5b-a248-2b3ee2c0bc55\/@D03B8ZJ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,Human antigen R (HuR),Adipogenesis,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12451"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Beth L.

Arrival of PCa cells to the bone homing organ is accompanied by a metabolic adaptation, which may be mediated by bone secreted factors. Herein, we sought to identify key metabolic genes fueling PCa bone metastasis and soluble factors secreted by bone cells leading to the metabolic rewiring of tumoral cells. By an indirect transwell co-culture system of PCa (PC3) and bone progenitor cells (MC3T3, pre-osteoblasts; or Raw264.7, pre-osteoclasts) we analyzed the transcriptome (RNA-seq) of PC3 cells modulated by soluble factors released from bone precursors. GSEA showed a strong activation of lipid metabolism, including PPAR and PI3K-Akt pathways, fat absorption and digestion. We then performed a Principal Component Analysis using transcriptomic data from human PCa and bone metastasis samples (GSE74685), showcasing that those metabolic genes that appeared significantly dysregulated in the co-culture model could accurately cluster samples by their tissue of origin in two defined groups: primary PCa and bone metastasis. This result was confirmed by an unsupervised clustering analysis, highlighting that the transcriptional metabolic profile triggered in the <i>in vitro<\/i> model has a clinical correlate in human bone metastasis samples. Interestingly, when performing a survival analysis for those genes in the SU2C-PCF dataset, we observed that 4 lipid-associated genes, <i>PPARA<\/i>, <i>VDR<\/i>, <i>SLC16A1<\/i> and <i>GPX1<\/i>, correlated with a shorter overall survival time, and appeared as independent risk-predictors of death (HR: 4.96, 2.85, 3.93 and 3.67, respectively; P&#60;0.05). These results prompted us to evaluate the communication axis by which the expression of the lipid transcriptomic signature is regulated in PC3 cells co-cultured with bone progenitor cells. We performed an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN) showing that the tumoral Protein Kinase A (PKA) appears as a master regulator of this signature. Accordingly, when we treated PC3 cells with the conditioned media (CM) of PC3 grown alone or the co-culture, we observed a decreased ATP content in the latter compared with controls, which is restored upon PKA inhibition, confirming the role of this kinase in the metabolic phenotype of co-cultured cells. Finally, secretome analysis (ESI-MS\/MS) of CM from the co-cultures displayed relevant soluble factors secreted by bone progenitors (Col1a1, Fn1) which are directly linked to PKA activity. Overall, we identified an early lipid-related gene signature in PCa cells triggered by the dialogue with bone cells, enough to discriminate metastatic human PCa from primary tumors and critical for PCa survival. This signature may respond to released soluble bone factors through tumoral cell PKA activation. Our findings pinpoint new attractive metabolic druggable targets to halt disease progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c9357332-1414-4b75-b210-13098fd008a2\/@D03B8ZJ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,Prostate cancer,Target discovery,Lipid metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12452"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pablo Sanchis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Anselmino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosario Lavignolle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agustina Sabater<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Estefania Labanca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Bizzotto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofia Lage-Vickers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaston Pascual<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rocio Seniuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ayelen Toro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nora Navone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javier Cotignla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elba Vazquez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geraldine Gueron<\/i><\/presenter>.

We previously showed that resistance can emerge rapidly, in a mutation-independent manner, through epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming associated with a metabolic shift towards oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that genes associated with mitochondrial activation may drive the transition to chemoresistance.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Using our previously published (PMID: 21518726, 23784558, 32017074) model of bladder cancer plasticity, we FACS-sorted BC cell lines into highly aggressive, stem-like, drug-resistant side population (SP) and non-stem-like drug-sensitive non-side population (NSP). SP and NSP cells were analyzed by RNA-seq, and differentially expressed genes were entered into the Gene Transcription Regulation Database (GTRD; <u>http:\/\/gtrd.biouml.org\/<\/u><u><\/u>) to identify candidate upstream regulators associated with OxPhos. For functional analysis, T24 and J82 BC cells were treated with cisplatin, with or without siRNA knockdown of candidate driver genes, followed by qRT-PCR, Western blot, FACS, and cell counts.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Differentially expressed genes between SP and NSP were analyzed by GTRD, which predicted Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial (TFAM) as a key upstream driver of the phenotypic transition between the two cell states. Overexpression of TFAM in SP cells was confirmed by qRT-PCR (1.8-fold, p value &#60;0.001). Cisplatin treatment (10&#956;M) induced higher expression of TFAM mRNA and protein (1.6-fold, p value &#60;0.001 and 1.7-fold, p value &#60;0.001, respectively, at 72hr). Conversely, siRNA-mediated TFAM knock-down at 48hr reduced the number of SP cells (0.5-fold, p value 0.03), depleted mitochondrial DNA (0.7-fold, p value &#60;0.001), and synergized with cisplatin to kill BC cells (coefficient of drug interaction: 0.57, p value &#60;0.001). TCGA analysis revealed significantly higher TFAM expression in primary BC tumors vs. normal (p value &#60;0.001) and in higher histological grade (p value 0.006).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We demonstrate that drug-resistant BC cells overexpress TFAM, a known mitochondrial activator, and that more aggressive BC in TCGA is also marked by TFAM elevation. Importantly, cisplatin exposure induces TFAM expression which in turn drives a rapid shift towards a drug-resistant phenotype. Hence, TFAM may play a key role in non-mutation-mediated metabolic plasticity, permitting a subset of BC cells to persist in the face of cisplatin exposure. Further analysis of TFAM and its partners may elucidate new therapeutic targets to delay or avert drug resistance in BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58480e93-c06e-4536-8f24-99ff26d2209e\/@D03B8ZJ3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Bladder cancer,Mitochondria,Cisplatin resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12453"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maheen Iqbal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tong Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Tsung Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amir Goldkorn<\/i><\/presenter>.

Due to a lack of targeted therapies, investigation into the metabolic drivers of TNBC progression at both the primary and secondary site is vital to direct future treatment strategies. Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is an anaplerotic enzyme vital for TNBC metastasis to the lungs, though its expression is commonly suppressed in the primary tumor compared to normal tissue. In this study, we investigated the role of PC expression in the metabolic reprogramming of TNBC cell lines and how its reduced expression in vivo may support primary tumor progression.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Modulation of PC expression in M-Wnt cell lines was achieved through lentiviral-mediated transduction of PCx-targeting short hairpin RNAs (ShPC). In vitro metabolic alterations to central carbon metabolism following PC suppression were assessed via intracellular lactate and NAD<sup>+<\/sup>\/NADH assays. Functional shifts in mitochondrial metabolism were assessed via extracellular flux analysis in various substrate conditions. Electron transport chain (ETC)-intrinsic dysfunction was assessed via high-resolution respirometry (HRR) and qPCR analysis of ETC gene expression. C57BL\/6J mice were injected with ShPC M-Wnt cells and the resulting tumors were harvested after 4 weeks following injection. Metabolomic analysis, mass cytometry, and HRR were conducted with samples from excised tumors.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> PC knockdown in vitro results in reduced oxygen consumption and a gene expression profile indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Genes encoding subunits of ETC complexes such as ND4FA10, SDHB, and ATP5c1 were downregulated while markers of mitochondrial biogenesis were upregulated following suppression of PC. Intracellular lactate and cell proliferation assays revealed enhanced flux through lactate dehydrogenase and sensitization of PC knockdown M-Wnt cells to lactate metabolism inhibitors. PC knockdown in vivo resulted in enhanced primary tumor growth and an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment, as indicated by downregulated cytokine signaling and reduced cell fractions of critical anti-tumor immune cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Suppression of PC in vitro results in mitochondrial dysfunction, manifesting in a metabolic phenotype characterized by enhanced production of lactate and reduced oxidative phosphorylation. In vivo, PC knockdown resulted in enhanced primary tumor growth and a tumor immune landscape indicative of immunosuppression. We conclude that PC knockdown promotes distinct metabolic reprogramming of the primary mammary tumor microenvironment associated with immune evasion and enhanced tumor progression.<br \/><b>Funding: <\/b>This study was supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute (R35 CA197627 to SD Hursting, and RO1 CA232589 to SD Hursting and D.

HCC originates from differentiated hepatocytes. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of the tumor suppressor p53 is required for the differentiated hepatocytes to acquire the features that are needed for their conversion to HCC progenitor cells (HcPCs). However, the initiation of p53 response to de-differentiation of damaged hepatocytes is largely unclear. p53 is tightly controlled by MDM2 and MDMX. We and others have previously demonstrated that multiple stresses can trigger the binding of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated MDMX, or ribosomal proteins L5 and L11 to MDM2, to further disrupt the MDMX- or MDM2-p53 association and lead to p53 activation. This was validated by two animal models, MDM2<sup>C305F<\/sup> and MDMX<sup>3SA<\/sup> knock-in mice that are defective in 14-3-3-MDMX and L5\/L11-MDM2 interactions, respectively. By crossing these two mouse lines, we generated a double knock-in (DKI) mouse line. With this line, we found that carcinogen DEN-induced HCC occurrence is significantly higher in MDM2<sup>C305F<\/sup>-MDMX<sup>3SA<\/sup> -DKI mice, and HcPCs isolated from DEN-treated DKI mice display significantly more stem cell- and malignancy- properties and higher tumorigenesis when introduced into mouse livers. Furthermore, we found that MTHFD1L, a monofunctional tetrahydrofolate synthase required for mitochondrial 1-carbon (1C) metabolism, is transcriptionally suppressed by p53 and exerts a critical effect on the accelerated HCC initiation in DKI mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate a crucial role of these two p53-activating pathways in preventing HCC initiation by controlling the mitochondrial 1C- metabolism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,liver cancer initiation,MTHFD1L,1C metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12456"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yiwei Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yitian Zha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Lu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Identifying new factors that promote drug resistance is critical to restoring drug sensitivity and improving patient outcomes. Methylmalonic acid (<b>MMA<\/b>) is a dicarboxylic acid by-product of propionate metabolism. MMA levels rise in the serum with age and are associated with cancer-related mortality (the higher the MMA, the worse the mortality). We recently asked whether this metabolite had a functional impact and showed that treating non-small cell lung cancer (<b>NSCLC<\/b>) cells with MMA <i>in vitro<\/i> promotes drug resistance through triggering epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (<b>EMT<\/b>)<i>.<\/i> However, whether MMA is elevated in lung cancer is not known, and how MMA levels are regulated is poorly understood.<br \/>To determine if MMA is elevated in NSCLC, we performed targeted metabolomics on 20 resected lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas with matched normal lung tissue. We found that MMA was 2.5 fold elevated in tumors compared to controls (p&#60;0.001, paired t-test). To our knowledge, this is the first report of MMA being elevated in any cancer. <b>MMAB<\/b> is one of the key MMA regulatory genes. When MMAB is inactivated or underexpressed, MMA cannot be metabolized and its intracellular levels increase. We hypothesized that loss of MMAB expression may explain elevated MMA levels in lung cancer. To test this, we analyzed publicly available mRNA expression data sets and found that MMAB is underexpressed in NSCLC (suggesting high levels of MMA). Moreover, MMAB expression correlates with survival. The lower the MMAB expression (suggesting higher MMA), the worse the survival (Hazard Ratio 0.36, p&#60;0.001). We thus asked if suppressing MMAB expression had a functional impact on cell lines. Using shRNA constructs, we knocked down MMAB in the A549 and H1975 NSCLC cell lines. Targeted metabolomics confirmed that knockdown of MMAB increased MMA levels. Moreover, knockdown of MMAB decreased cellular proliferation and increased resistance to carboplatin, pemetrexed, and osimertinib. RNA-seq analysis showed that suppressing MMAB induced EMT and senescence expression signatures. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia and nutrient stress downregulate MMAB expression at the mRNA and protein level. Collectively, our data suggest that loss of MMAB expression through hypoxia or nutrient stress can increase MMA levels, triggering EMT and resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy in NSCLC. Our results indicate that dysregulation of MMA plays an important role in lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2e19da6-c8fe-4eae-9199-7b8d6384a217\/@E03B8ZJ4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Metabolomics,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12457"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bobak Parang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhongchi Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivien Low<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Endress<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murtaza Malbari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashish Saxena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nasser Altorki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Blenis<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the U.S., men are four times more likely to be diagnosed with bladder cancer than women. Our research group has previously identified alterations in xenobiotic metabolism in BLCA. In this study, using a metabolomics approach, we identified alterations in the arachidonic acid pathway in bladder tumors from male versus female patients. Included within this altered arachidonic acid pathway was downregulation of EPHX2, an enzyme that converts epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DiHETs). Consistent with this, levels of EETs were significantly elevated in bladder tumors derived from male versus female patients. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis further revealed that reduced expression of EPHX2 was significantly associated with poor clinical outcome across multiple publicly available datasets only in male BLCA patients but not in females. Mechanistic studies revealed that EPHX2 over-expression in male-derived BLCA cell line reduced cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Overall, these studies nominate EPHX2 as a potential tumor suppressor in male patients with BLCA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e93df055-9f24-4d5e-b953-f492796a4c68\/@E03B8ZJ4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,EPHX2,arachidonic acid pathway,Gender disparity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12458"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohammed Khurshidul Hassan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roshan Borkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karthik Reddy Kami Reddy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danthasinghe Waduge Badrajee Piyarathna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chandra Shekar Amara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison Bellman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>ChandraShekar R.

Among all lung cancers, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent (nearly 85%) with a 5-year survival of about 25% when all stages are considered.NSCLCs are frequently mutated in <i>KRAS<\/i> or <i>STK11\/LKB1<\/i> and co-mutation is often reported. Considering the key role of STK11\/LKB1 in controlling cell metabolism, we hypothesized that NSCLC harboring mutations in this gene could be vulnerable to metabolic stresses. Different studies in the last years have highlighted how is possible to interfere with cancer metabolism using metformin and caloric restriction.Our work aimed at investigating the role of metabolic stress in determining response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy in <i>LKB1<\/i> mutated NSCLC model.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>For isolation of cell lines with the genetic backgrounds, nodules from lungs of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>\/LKB1<sup>wt<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>\/LKB1<sup>mu<\/sup><sup>t<\/sup> transgenic mice were used. Stabilized cell lines were then inoculated intramuscularly in immunocompetent mice and treated with chemotherapy alone (cisplatin) or in combination with metformin and caloric restriction. Caloric restriction consisted of 36 hours of fasting every week for three weeks. Metformin<br \/>was administered daily for the entire experiment while cisplatin was given once a week for three weeks.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We started our <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments comparing the response of the tumors characterized by the mutation in <i>KRAS<\/i><i><sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> or the co-mutation <i>KRAS<\/i><i><sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i><i>\/LKB<\/i><i>1<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup>. The results indicate that the addition of metformin and caloric restriction improve the activity of cisplatin in both tumors but a stronger effect was detected in tumors presenting the deletion of <i>LKB1<\/i>.

IL-4 receptor is established to cause polarization of macrophages to a pro-tumor M2 phenotype. While much is known about the signaling effects of IL-4 in immune cells there is relatively little known about its effects in cancer cells that express the receptor. Our lab has established a role of signaling in IL4 receptor expressing cancer cells for promoting metastasis. Many of the effects of IL-4 signaling in immune cells are accompanied by metabolic changes. Thus, we aimed to study the effects of IL-4 signaling on metabolism in breast cancer to better understand how these metabolic changes might induce metastatic phenotypes associated with IL-4 stimulation. IL-4 increased glucose uptake in multiple human TNBC cell lines assessed via NBDG uptake assay. Production of lactate was also significantly increased as assessed by colorimetric assay. We then became interested in possible alterations in metabolism downstream of increased glucose uptake. By Seahorse assay we found that IL-4 significantly increased glycolysis, as well as mitochondrial metabolism when assessed by ATP Rate assay. By metabolic flux using C<sup>13<\/sup> labeled glucose we found that IL-4 increased incorporation of carbon from glucose into lactate while not having a significant effect on TCA cycle intermediates. This led us to question whether IL-4 may affect other arms of metabolism that feed into TCA cycle and mitochondrial metabolism. We looked at how IL4 impacts glutaminolysis and found that IL-4 stimulation leads to increased expression of glutamine transporter ASCT2, as well as increased glutamine uptake. We have begun to examine whether these metabolic changes affect epigenetic regulation. Initial data indicates that IL4 treatment leads to increased histone acetylation in TNBC cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ccf2b48c-62de-46bc-8ba9-881ecfac0686\/@E03B8ZJ4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Epigenetics,Cytokines,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12463"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Demond Williams<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wendy Bindeman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ebony Hargrove-Wiley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Fingleton<\/i><\/presenter>.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of lung cancer and is the leading cause of cancer related mortalities worldwide. LUAD has an extremely poor five-year survival rate, which is likely due to cases being diagnosed at advanced stages and thus being more difficult to treat the metastatic disease. Identifying the molecular processes that contribute to disease progression is a critical goal in lung cancer research that could lead to predictive biomarkers and novel therapies. Glycogen is the primary form of carbohydrate storage in mammalian cells, and its degradation product, Glucose 6-Phosphate (G6P) feeds directly into glycolysis, making glycogen intimately connected to central carbon metabolism. Recently, aberrant glycogen accumulation in lung tumors has been reported to promote lung cancer progression, driven by largely unknown mechanisms. We recently generated a transgenic <i>KRAS<\/i><i><sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i><i>\/p53<\/i><i><sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i><i> <\/i>LUAD mouse model that also lacks the glycogen phosphatase laforin (LKO). This model develops increased glycogen accumulation in the lungs and displays accelerated tumor growth compared to the <i>KRAS<\/i><i><sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i><i>\/p53<\/i><i><sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>control (WT), as measured by Ki67 staining. To identify potential biological processes perturbed by LUAD-glycogen, we performed RNA-seq on lung tumors resected from WT and LKO mice. We identified over 300 genes that are differentially expressed between WT and LKO lung tumors. Specifically, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed genes that were upregulated in LKO lung tumors were involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell-to-cell communication, and cell proliferation. All of these processes are implicated in tumor growth, which supports our initial observation that LKO mice have increased tumor burden and disease progression. Our findings ultimately highlight several potential mechanisms by which LUAD-glycogen promotes LUAD tumor progression, which can be further investigated to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Metabolism,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12464"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jessica Faith Lamb<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsey R.

Mitochondrial fission 1 protein (Fis1) plays a minor role in basal fission, but has been shown to be more critical for pathological fission. Further, it has been shown to facilitate peripheral fission events, generally occurring after cellular exposure to stress, as a means to prepare damaged mitochondria for degradation through mitophagy. Therefore, my goal is to elucidate the role of Fis1, an integral outer membrane partner protein, in mitochondrial fission within GBM cells. I propose that Fis1 plays a protective role against therapeutic treatment in GBM. This is demonstrated through experiments showing that ionizing radiation (IR) leads to upregulation of Fis1 protein levels, while GBM cell viability is simultaneously unaffected. Further, this increase in Fis1 results in an increase in mitochondrial fission, which likely reflects an increase in mitophagy as a response to IR stress. Thus, I anticipate that GBM cells upregulate Fis1 as a protective measure and that targeting Fis1 function could have therapeutic benefit. In this regard, I have found that depletion of Fis1 alters mitochondrial morphology, and I am studying changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics to correlate ultrastructural changes with mitochondrial function. Preliminary data suggests that Fis1 knockdown in Gli36 cells leads to decreased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, with deficits observed specifically in Complex I and III. Concurrently, I am assessing potential synergistic effects of combined radiation and Fis1 inhibition on GBM cell viability and proliferation. To do this, I will use genetic and small molecule approaches to inhibit Fis1-dependent mitochondrial fission. Overall, these studies will demonstrate whether Fis1 drives pathological fission to promote cancer cell growth and proliferation. Additionally, the selective inhibition will evaluate Fis1 as a novel therapeutic target in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/396dbad5-8bc5-4a7f-aef7-9dc744befc73\/@E03B8ZJ4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Glioblastoma,Radiation,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12466"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuli Buckley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adina Brett-Morris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Stoll<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Mears<\/i><\/presenter>.

Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of heme in mitochondrial metabolism and OXPHOS. Heme is an essential molecule in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway especially since Complex II-IV all contain heme. During lung tumorigenesis there is a marked increase in heme synthesis and uptake; other protein and enzymes relating to heme were also upregulated. Heme-sequestration proteins (HeSPs) have shown high effectiveness in suppressing the development and progression of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, therefore targeting heme using CycT should yield similar results. Previous studies have indicated that cyclopamine tartrate (CycT) can effectively arrest lung tumor growth and progression. CycT does this by inhibiting the levels of proteins and enzymes involved in heme uptake, synthesis, as well as reducing heme synthesis and degradation in adenocarcinoma. We therefore aim to examine the effectiveness of CycT in both, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.In vitro experiments using NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and squamous cell carcinoma HCC15 are in progression with initial results supporting the hypothesis. Cell proliferation assays have shown a marked decrease in CycT-treated groups in both cell lines. Based on colony formation assays, results indicate that CycT inhibits colony formation. Heme synthesis and degradation have also shown the effectiveness of CycT in suppressing tumorigenesis in both cell types. Oxygen consumption rates of both cell types were examined with CycT inhibiting oxygen consumption. Overall, in vitro experiments support the idea that CycT can suppress or arrest lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fa16deb2-23e9-4205-b6f1-1bc1bf2182fd\/@E03B8ZJ4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12468"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eranda Berisha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adnin Ashrafi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Del Carmen Chacon Castro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Tumor cells present a high rate of glucose and glutamine uptake and part of these nutrients supplies the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), whose exacerbation has been related to solid tumors progression, including colorectal cancer. Uridine diphosphate <i>N<\/i>-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the end product of HBP, serves as the donor for several enzymes involved in glycan biosynthesis. Aberrant glycosylation is known to affect cellular and molecular mechanisms related to the malignant phenotype. Beta 1,6-GlcNAc branches on <i>N<\/i>-glycans (products of the MGAT5 enzyme) are associated with greater stability of transmembrane glycoproteins, as glutamine and glucose transporters, and growth factor receptors. Furthermore, changes in the availability of UDP-GlcNAc<i> <\/i>can affect<i> <\/i>the levels of hyaluronic acid (HA) and O-GlcNAc-modified proteins. The interplay between different direct demands for UDP-GlcNAc is not well understood and may help to better understand tumor metabolism. Therefore, we intend to evaluate in colorectal cancer cells how changes in levels of branched beta1,6-GlcNAc <i>N<\/i>-glycans can affect both the hexosamine pathway and the different processes which demand UDP-GlcNAc (such as O-GlcNAcylation and hyaluronic acid synthesis). For this, two experimental strategies were performed. The first focused on the inhibition of complex <i>N<\/i>-glycans using swainsonine, and the second focused on the <i>MGAT5<\/i> inactivation using CRISPR-Cas9. The levels of UDP-GlcNAc were also manipulated using DON, an inhibitor of the GFAT enzyme. Initially, it was found that both the pharmacological inhibition of complex <i>N<\/i>-glycan biosynthesis and the specific inactivation of MGAT5 lead to significantly reduced levels of hexosamine pathway intermediates, activated monosaccharides, and proteins modified by <i>O<\/i>-GlcNAc. Furthermore, it was also observed that MGAT5 inactivation enhances the expression of genes encoding<i> <\/i>HA synthases (<i>HAS2<\/i> and <i>HAS3<\/i>). Upon detection of metabolites by LC-MS, a multivariate analysis was performed using the statistical method of Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and it was observed that KO MGAT5 cells formed a metabolically distinct population from MOCK cells. Interestingly, after pharmacological inhibition of GFAT, an increase in the levels of beta 1,6-GlcNAc branched <i>N<\/i>-glycans and a reduction in O-GlcNAcylation were observed. Treatment with DON was also able to reduce <i>HAS2<\/i> expression however an increased in <i>HAS3<\/i> expression was observed. These data suggest that there is a relationship among different demands for UDP-GlcNAc in tumor cells and a possible regulatory role played by beta 1,6-GlcNAc branched <i>N<\/i>-glycans in this issue. This work contributes to a better understanding of interconnections between biochemical processes that demand UDP-GlcNAc in the context of colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1cecd7a6-592b-4fd5-b515-5553e99c69cb\/@E03B8ZJ4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glycosylation,Cancer metabolism,Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12471"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Érika Elias Ferreira<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isadora De Araújo Oliveira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adriane Regina Todeschini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julio Cesar Madureira De Freitas-Junior<\/i><\/presenter>.

Obesity causes inflammation and downregulates anti-tumor immunity generating a protumor microenvironment and increases the risk of breast cancer (BC) development and metastasis. Also, obesity affects cilium length, which could disrupt the essential role of the cilium in detecting extracellular cues, coordinating cell signaling responses, and regulating cell fate and mitochondrial function. However, there is a gap in understanding the effects of obesity on ciliogenesis in cancer cells and in regard to the impact of cilium length and localization on mitochondrial function of tumor cells. We therefore sought to elucidate the impact of obesity on the presence, localization, and function of primary cilium, using murine models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).<br \/>Methods: We generated mammary tumors by orthotopic transplantation of murine metM-Wnt<sup>lung<\/sup> or E0771 TNBC cells, and evaluated the impact of obesity on ciliary specific gene sets in tumors using GSEA analysis. We also tested the abundance of cilium in tumor sections using immunofluorescence. Additionally, we developed metM-Wnt<sup>lung<\/sup> and E0771 expressing the ciliary transmembrane protein Smo fluorescently tagged to pHluorin. Using these cells, we performed in vitro studies to investigate the length and cellular localization of the cilium in cancer cells in 3 compartments; intracellular (in), intermediate, or extracellular (out).<br \/>Results: Our GSEA analysis results indicated significant upregulation of 18\/19 ciliary gene sets in metM-Wnt<sup>lung<\/sup> mammary tumors from obese mice and 19\/19 ciliary gene sets in E0771 mammary tumors from obese mice compared to the corresponding tumors developed in non-obese mice. Ongoing leading-edge analysis will determine the genes driving the enrichment of ciliary-related gene sets in tumors of obese mice. Immunofluorescence analysis showed a significant number of ciliated cells in tumor sections of obese mice and in cultured cells expressing pHluorin-Smo. Ongoing studies will reveal the specific cellular localization of the cilium on cancer cells and the effects on mitochondrial function. Our research is establishing a proof-of-concept that mammary cancer cells express cilium and will elucidate key mechanistic details related to the role of the primary cilium in the crosstalk between obesity and cancer metabolism.

Late detection of OVCA is common as screening is done mostly in women over 63. This delay in screening coupled with poor prognosis presents the need for novel treatment measures. Repurposing of Metformin (Met), a biguanide used to increase insulin responses in the body, has been identified as a promising approach for therapeutic treatment in OVCA patients. The purpose of this study is to isolate metabolic pathways used by Met to alter OVCA onset. Preliminary results show that Met inhibits cell proliferation and clonogenic growth in both HeyA8 and HeyA8MDR which are drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines, respectively. In combination with carboplatin, Met treatment enhanced chemosensitivity in both cell lines. In addition, lipidomic analysis was done to monitor the impact of lipid metabolites on OVCA cells. Our analysis showed differences in neutral lipid composition in drug-sensitive and resistant cells which indicates the role of various lipid species play in mediating drug-resistance. Furthermore, Met treatment triggered anti-cancerous pathways through syntheses of lipid metabolites. This data indicates that cell proliferation, along with clonogenic growth are inhibited dose dependently by Met treatment in drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cell lines. Chemosensitivity is enhanced by Met treatment in combination with carboplatin in HeyA8 and HeyA8MDR cell lines. Together, the data suggests that autophagy and lipid biogenesis can be altered through metabolic pathways by Met treatment. Through the use of repurposed Metformin, this approach shows promising results of a treatment regimen and potential prevention of OVCA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2446ebd3-9b17-4bd7-ad26-16938f498758\/@E03B8ZJ4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Metformin,Lipid metabolism,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13952"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brenita Colette Jenkins<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Debarshi Roy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristal Maner-Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Viji Shridhar<\/i><\/presenter>.

As cancer cells adapt themselves in a suspended state in the blood stream before penetration and regrowth at distal tissues, understanding their survival strategy in an anchorage-independent condition is important to develop appropriate therapeutics. We have previously generated adapted suspension cells (ASCs) from parental adherent cancer cells to study the characteristics of circulating tumor cells. In this study, we explored metabolic rewiring in MDA-MB-468 ASCs to adapt to suspension growth conditions through extracellular flux analyses and various metabolic assays. We also determined the relationship between protein kinase B (AKT) activation and metabolic rewiring in ASCs using the AKT inhibitor, MK2206.<b> <\/b>ASCs reprogramed metabolism to enhance glycolysis and basal oxygen consumption rate. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the upregulation in the genes related to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The changes in the metabolic program led to a remarkable dependency of ASCs on carbohydrates as an energy source for proliferation as compared to parental adherent cells (ADs). AKT activation was observed in ASCs and those generated from pancreatic and other breast cancer cells, and AKT activation inhibition in ASCs decreased glycolysis and oxygen consumption. AKT activation is an important strategy for obtaining energy through the enhancement of glycolysis in ASCs. The regulation of AKT activity and\/or glycolysis may provide a new therapeutic strategy to prevent the metastatic spread of cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13953"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Young Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Jeong Ju<\/i><\/presenter>.

While surgical resection of early-stage tumors remains the standard carefor patients, advanced ccRCC, metastatic or recurrent, portends a 5-year survival rate of only 12%, primarilydue to insensitivity toward conventional chemotherapy. ccRCC is identifiable histologically by its dramaticlipid storage phenotype, similar to adipocytes; yet the role of lipid metabolism in ccRCC is poorly understood.One of the well-established risk factors for ccRCC is obesity, and given that adipose tissue is known to producea variety of pro-adipogenic signaling molecules (called adipokines), we hypothesized that adipokine signalingmight be involved in the etiology of ccRCC. Our lab has recently identified a pro-tumorigenic adipokineprotein, chemerin (<i>RARRES2<\/i>), that is positively correlated with tumor aggressiveness. Suppression of chemerinvia either monoclonal antibody or siRNA led to reduction in lipid storage and significant tumor growthimpairment in both<i> in vitro<\/i> and<i> in vivo<\/i> models, suggesting the feasibility of targeting lipid metabolism as atreatment option in ccRCC patients. In this study, we investigate the signaling mechanisms of chemerin andhave found that chemerin drives downstream cellular activities and lipid deposition. We utilized CRISPR toknockout two candidate receptors of chemerin, GPR1 and CMLKR1, to gain insight into the signal transduction.CMLKR1 is a G-protein coupled receptor widely expressed on a variety of immune cells whereas GPR1expression is reported primarily in adipose tissues. While unknown on their detailed signaling cascadez, bothreceptors affect lipid metabolism related gene profiles in our ccRCC cell lines. Furthermore, both GPR1 andCMKLR1 knockout lead to growth suppression and decreased intracellular lipid deposition, highlighting theinvolvement of both receptors in regulating lipid metabolism and conferring growth advantage in ccRCC. Ourdata so far have shown the feasibility of identifying metabolic weaknesses in ccRCC, raising that possibility thattargeting lipid metabolism could be beneficial in ccRCC. Further investigation will be conducted to assess thetargetability of this ligand\/receptor axis and various<i> in vivo<\/i> models including PDX and transgenic will be usedto assess the translational potential of our findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f22c035f-d391-43e1-960e-f7dd40966713\/@F03B8ZJ5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipid metabolism,Cancer metabolism,Kidney cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13954"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dazhi Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

It is known that anomalous metabolism is a hallmark for cancer, however the relationship between mutant KRAS and tumor metabolism in CRCs has not been fully explored. We recently showed sex-disparities in metabolism by primary tumor location, indicating the pressing need to investigate the role of biological sex in CRC. Our aim was therefore to determine whether mutant KRAS alters metabolism in a sex-specific manner. We performed non-targeted metabolomics and targeted metabolomics on stage I-III chemotherapy-naive KRAS-mutant and wild type CRC patient tumor tissues (n=197) using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (QTOF-MS), and tandem MS (MS\/MS). Our results showed that tumors from male patients were cystine(cysteine)-dependent, with altered glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, transsulfuration activity, methionine metabolism, utilization of lipoxygenase pathways. Simultaneously, we performed comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus to further validate mutant KRAS effects on CRCs by sex. Our findings demonstrated differential expression to <i>CBS, GPX4, GSS, ACSL4, ATF4, FTH1<\/i> and <i>EGPR<\/i> genes that are all involved in regulation of these metabolic pathways and indicate a role for ferroptosis. This data therefore validated our findings of decreased transsulfuration activity (regulated by CBS) and decreased GSH biosynthesis (regulated by GSS) in male patients; this finding was not seen in female patients. To further examine differences in ferroptosis by sex, it was seen that <i>GPX4<\/i> was differentially expressed between KRAS mutant and wild type (p&#60;0.05) in males, but not in females. Meanwhile, <i>ACSL4<\/i>, which appears to be a predictive marker for ferroptosis sensitivity, showed upregulated expression in males with mutant KRAS (p&#60;0.00001). Further, KRAS mutant type linked to a poor 5-year overall survival only in male using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. This is the first report to show unique sex-specific metabolic signatures by KRAS status in CRC patients indicating a role of decreased ferroptosis in males, thus a novel avenue for therapeutic approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2b4a8b0f-6111-4edc-96cb-e0bb7673a652\/@F03B8ZJ5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Colorectal cancer,Glutathione,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18174"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hong Yan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuping Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyi Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhishek Jain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip B Paty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus Bosenberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sajid A Khan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>.

In cell culture, cell lines with MTAP-deletions show elevations of its substrate metabolite, methylthioadenosine (MTA). High levels of MTA inhibit PRMT5, which sensitizes MTAP-deleted cell lines to PRMT5 and MAT2A inhibition. While extensively corroborated in vitro, the clinical efficacy of these strategies ultimately relies on equally significant accumulations of MTA in human tumors. In this work, using comprehensive metabolomic profiling, we show that MTA is primarily secreted, resulting in exceedingly high levels of extracellular MTA in vitro. We further show that primary human glioblastoma tumors minimally accumulate MTA in vivo, which is likely explained by the metabolism of MTA by MTAP-competent stromal cells. Together, these findings highlight the metabolic discrepancies between in vitro models and primary human tumors and should thus be carefully considered in the development of the precision therapies targeting MTAPhomozygous deleted GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e85b6ec2-cbf0-4558-b58a-50fa9a442b2c\/@F03B8ZJ5\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18287"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yasaman Barekatain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Ackroyd<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victoria Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunada Khadka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ko-Chien Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raghu Kalluri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John De Groot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Huse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Muller<\/i><\/presenter>.
