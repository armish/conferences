[{"Abstract":"We have previously reported that the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase KMT2D (also called MLL4, MLL2, and ALR; a transcriptional coactivator) is required for neuronal differentiation of human neuron-committed NT2\/D1 embryonal carcinoma stem cells. Notably, we have shown that brain-specific knockout of <i>Kmt2d <\/i>alone induces spontaneous medulloblastoma (MB) in mice and that <i>Kmt2d <\/i>loss in the brain highly upregulates several oncogenic signaling programs and downregulates tumor suppressor genes. Consistent with this, our analysis of several publicly available databases indicates that <i>Kmt2d<\/i><b> <\/b>is the most frequently mutated epigenetic modifier (8%&#8210;10%) in MB. In this study, we sought to assess whether <i>Kmt2d <\/i>loss cooperates with another oncogenic event in MB genesis. Particularly, <i>PTCH<\/i> (also known as <i>PTCH1<\/i>), a potent MB-signaling suppressor, is one of the most frequently mutated genes in MB, and <i>KMT2D<\/i> mutations co-occur with <i>PTCH<\/i> mutations more than with many other mutations in MB. Therefore, we determined the effect of <i>Kmt2d<\/i> loss on of <i>Ptch<sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i>-driven MB genesis by generating and analyzing<i> Nestin-Cre <\/i><i>Kmt2d<\/i><sup>fl\/+<\/sup><i> <\/i><i>Ptch<\/i><sup>+\/-<\/sup> mice. Our results showed that heterozygous loss of <i>Kmt2d <\/i>strongly increased the genesis and incidence of <i>Ptch<\/i><sup>+\/-<\/sup>-driven MB. Supporting this, immunohistochemistry staining of Ki-67 (a proliferation marker) showed that heterozygous loss of <i>Kmt2d<\/i> in <i>Ptch<\/i><sup>+\/-<\/sup>-driven MB highly increased the proliferation of MB cells. Our transcriptomic analysis showed that heterozygous<i> <\/i><i>Kmt2d<\/i> loss upregulated tumor-promoting programs, including G-protein-coupled receptor signaling and oxidation-reduction process. In line with this, heterozygous<i> Kmt2d<\/i> loss upregulated oncogenic kinases (e.g., phospho-AKT1 and phospho-ERK) that may be downstream of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. Mechanistically, our results indicate that these tumor-promoting programs<i> <\/i>are repressed, at least in part, by the transcription-repressive and tumor-suppressive factor (s) NCOR2, whose expression is activated by KMT2D. Our results would be the first to provide molecular insights into how co-losses of an epigenetic modifier and an MB-signaling suppressor cooperate for MB genesis. Our new mouse model would be helpful in future preclinical therapeutic experiments for MB treatment. Our findings suggest that targeting oncogenic effectors downstream of KMT2D loss can be considered a potential therapeutic strategy for MB treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7046d8be-91a1-4350-b68d-1def85e2dfd0\/@v03B8ZJZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Histone methylation,Cancer,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17323"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shilpa S.

Abnormal histone methylation is often detected during tumor development and progression. NSD1, NSD2, and NSD3 are key histone methyltransferases (HMTs) that catalyze lysine 36 dimethylation (K36me2) at histone H3. Inactivating NSD1 mutations are frequent in head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) commonly occur in HPV-negative oropharyngeal (OP) carcinoma and laryngeal carcinomas (LC), and define a novel prognostic subtype in LC, where they associate with dramatically improved overall and progression-free survival. Here, we explored the biological impact of the loss of function of NSD1 in head neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC). First, we discovered that HNSCC cells with a damaging mutation in NSD1 have reduced K36me2 methylation levels relative to NSD1 wild-type HNSCC cells. Second, we also found slower cell proliferation in NSD1 mutant cell line (SCC4) in comparison with other NSD1 WT cell lines. To further investigate the biologic impact of NSDs, we knocked down NSD1 and NSD2 with shRNA in different histologic subtypes of HNSCC cell lines (JHU011, JHU022, Cal27, and FaDu cell lines). We discovered that depletion of NSD1 and NSD2 results in a reduction of K36me2 and a significant decrease in cell proliferation and clonogenic formation in HNSCC, but not in lung cancer cells. Next, we performed a flow cytometry-based assay and found that NSD1\/NSD2 depletion in HNSCC cells causes a significant increase in apoptosis level. We also probed for gene expression and signaling in HNSCC cells following NSD1 depletion using RNA sequencing and reverse protein phase array (RPPA) approaches. From a list of RPPA candidate targets of NSD1, we confirmed the decrease in the protein and mRNA level of Phosphatidylinositol-5-Phosphate 4-Kinase Type 2 Beta (PIP4K2B), but not other members of this family (PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C). PIP4K2B may regulate the ratio of lipid messengers PI5P and PI(4,5)P2 (substrate and reaction product, respectively). The level of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated kinase p70S6 was also decreased under NSD1 knockdown. PIP4K2B siRNA depletion has also led to a significant decrease in HNSCC proliferation. Taken together, this data supports the idea that NSD1 is required for HNSCC cell proliferation via PIP4K2B. Downstream signaling, gene expression effects, and possible cell cycle regulation by NSD enzymes remain to be investigated in more detail. Further, NSDs might be attractive targets for drug development, and targeting NSD1\/NSD2 enzymes may be a new strategy for improving outcomes in HNSCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a70a099-8021-46aa-9c4f-3ec7d88b0d67\/@v03B8ZJZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone methylation,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,NSD1,NSD2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17325"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Iuliia Topchu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajendra Pangeni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Bychkov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petr Makhov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Karanicolas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jindan Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erica Golemis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jochen Lorch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanis Boumber<\/i><\/presenter>.

Studies in mice demonstrated that Kmt2c is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in AML and inoculation of mammary fat pads with breast cancer cells that lack KMT2C had significantly larger tumor growth and reduced survival compared to mice injected with isogenic wild-type cells. Analysis of cBioportal&#8217;s curated set of non-redundant cancer patient studies indicates that loss of function KMT2C mutations significantly co-occur with RAS gain of function mutations. Our lab previously discovered that cells expressing oncogenic RAS displayed altered activation of enhancer gene regulator elements. We will test how loss of KMT2C cooperates with oncogenic Ras by: 1) characterizing the impact of KMT2C loss, with or without expression of oncogenic RAS, on biological properties of cells and global chromatin architecture and 2) characterizing how KMT2C loss may cooperate with oncogenic RAS to alter hematopoiesis and the global enhancer landscape in animal models. MEFs expressing heterozygous loss of Kmt2c have a proliferative advantage relative to WT littermate controls. Interestingly, WT MEFs demonstrate enhanced migration in a wound assay, but heterozygotes demonstrate an advantage in a transwell membrane assay. Heterozygotes further display greater EdU incorporation, indicating a greater propensity for entering S-phase and undergoing cell-division. RNA-seq experiments have indicated an upregulation of MAPK &#38; Ras signaling pathway genes in heterozygotes, whilst simultaneously downregulating gene pathways critical for proper extra-cellular matrix organization. Therefore, loss of Kmt2c disrupts biological cell phenotypes, in a manner relatable to the hallmarks of cancer, demonstrating how Kmt2c loss may promote malignancy. Further studies must now be performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms altered by loss of KMT2C and how they cause changes in cellular phenotypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cf08d519-d8db-498c-ac23-a8915cd74a09\/@v03B8ZJZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Chromatin remodeling,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Ras,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17326"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gabriel Prado<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard L.

KDM4 is a family of histone demethylases that can drive tumor growth by regulating transcription, cell cycle, and DNA replication\/repair. Overexpression of KDM4 alters post-translational histone modification and is associated with many types of cancer, including DLBCL.

Lysine (K) acetyltransferases 5 (KAT5) is reportedly implicated in cancer development and maintenance, although the role of KAT5 in lung cancer largely remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that KAT5 expression was lower in lung adenocarcinoma than normal lung cells. Overexpression of KAT5 had no effect on tumor proliferation and migration, whereas knockdown of KAT5 paradoxically decreased those activities. To assess KAT5 function in lung tumorigenesis in adults, we generated a lung cancer mouse model in which <i>Kat5<\/i> is conditionally deleted in lung. We achieved this by crossing lung-specific <i>EGFR-L858R-T790M<\/i> transgenic mice with conditional <i>Kat5<\/i> knockout mice, and found that complete deletion of <i>Kat5<\/i> resulted in suppression of tumor formation. To investigate downstream genes of KAT5, we performed RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis using H1975 KAT5 inducible knockdown cells and control cells. We identified a transglutaminase enzyme, TGM5, as one of downstream of KAT5. We furthermore identified artemisinin, an anti-malarial drug, as a potent KAT5 inhibitor by using the connectivity map database, and treatment with artemisinin suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis <i>in vitro<\/i> an <i>in vivo<\/i>. Taken together, suppression of KAT5 activity shows a tumor-specific efficacy against lung cancer in which KAT5 expression is lower, with no definite influence on normal tissues. Thereby, targeting KAT5 is a potent candidate for the treatment of lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3fdf9b35-fe59-4524-b47f-53246ffb007c\/@v03B8ZJZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Artemisinin,KAT5,TGM5,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17330"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daisuke Jefferson Shibahara<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naoki Akanuma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunyoung Heo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariko Ando<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ikei S.

Histone H3-K36 trimethylation is facilitated by <i>SETD2<\/i>, which is necessary for proper pre-mRNA intron splicing. Improperly spliced mature mRNA may lead to aberrant translation of retained introns (ATaRI), which represents potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. We explored this hypothesis using real world data and RCC models.<br \/>Methods and Results: Gene set enrichment analysis comparing <i>SETD2<\/i>-mutant to WT tumors using samples from the TCGA KIRC data set revealed that the unfolded protein response (UPR) was strongly enriched, as well as several immunotherapy-relevant pathways. This suggested that peptides arising from ATaRI may be present, since they would not be expected to fold properly and thus need to be addressed by the UPR pathway to maintain homeostasis. To investigate this further, we generated <i>Setd2<\/i>-isogenic RENCA cells using CRISPR. Knockout was confirmed by sequencing and immunoblot. H3K36 trimethylation was decreased or eliminated in monoclonal knockout cell lines, confirming a functional effect. Markers of UPR activation, including Atf4 and cleaved Atf6, were found to be upregulated in <i>Setd2<\/i>-mutant RENCA cells compared to controls as measured by immunoblot. Cleaved ATF6 translocates to the nucleus to induce the UPR transcriptional program. Consistent with this, Atf6 was found to localize to the nucleus in <i>Setd2<\/i>-knockout cells using immunofluorescence (IF). Analysis of tissue microarrays of human <i>SETD2<\/i>-mutant vs -WT ccRCC revealed increased ATF6 signal in areas with low H3K36 tri-methylation, indicating UPR activation <i>in vivo<\/i>. Interestingly, CHOP, another downstream effector of the UPR pathway which predominantly regulates cell death, did not become upregulated in Setd2-knockout cells, suggesting activation of a compensatory cell survival pathway. Geldanamycin was shown to destabilize the Perk and Ire1a arms of the UPR, which resulted in increased cell death in <i>Setd2<\/i> mutant cells using Cell Titre glo. Additionally, H3K36 trimethylation has been implicated in directing homologous repair of DNA, and blunted responses to agents that induce DNA double-strand breaks of p-Atm, p53, and Rad51 were observed by immunoblot and IF. The inability to detect DNA damage in <i>Setd2 <\/i>mutant cells however did not confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>We identify activation of the UPR upon <i>Setd2<\/i> loss and suggest that activation of part of the UPR pathway may represent a new therapeutic vulnerability for exploitation as a rationale for personalized medicine. We further characterize the altered DNA damage response in the setting of <i>Setd2<\/i> loss.

The robust epigenetic landscape plays a vital role in gene expression via its ability to promote or repress transcription. Reprogramming of these processes can lead to genomic instability, which may propagate a cancerous state. Thus, there are proteins that turn on and off genes can control cell growth and cancer behaviors. Our research focuses to combat this reprogramming utilizing novel small molecules; targeting epigenetic proteins involved in these gene regulatory pathways. Among all the cancer type, the pediatric cancers posted significant challenge for effective therapy development. Despite intense study and cooperative group trials, patients diagnosed with aggressive, high-risk pediatric tumors such as sarcomas, neuroblastoma, high grade gliomas and embryonal brain tumors have poor overall survival outcomes. In addition to the limited efficacy of conventional chemotherapy and radiation in such patients, these modalities are fraught with toxicities, leaving survivors with long-term deficits including infertility, heart failure, endocrine disruption and a risk of secondary malignancies. Thus, one of the most pressing clinical needs in pediatric oncology remains the identification of agents with potent anti-tumor activity that have limited toxicities. Recently, we have utilized both inhibitors and degraders to study the EP300 function in neuroblastoma, an aggressive, hard to treat pediatric cancer. Advances in chemical biology have recently identified a novel group of molecules, called <i>proteolysis-targeted chimaeras<\/i> (PROTACs) or degrader. These agents may be generated toward any target that has a small molecule binder. To fully assess the therapeutic potential of this novel strategy for pediatric cancers, and potentially for other cancers as well, we set out to target the histone acetyltransferase EP300 that regulates growth and survival in nearly 65% of cancer cell lines, especially in high-risk neuroblastoma. Here, we generated potent and specific reagents, including a lead molecule called JQAD1, that are capable of driving specific degradation of EP300 with limited off-target effects.

SMARCA4 is frequently overexpressed in several types of cancers. Overexpression has been linked to increased proliferation and survival, as well as aggressive tumors and poor prognosis. SMARCA4 knockdown in these tumors lead to inhibition of proliferation and increased sensitivity to known chemotherapeutic agents, supporting the validity of targeting SMARCA4. Genetic silencing studies have established that the oncogenic activity of tumors lacking SMARCA4 is primarily driven by SMARCA2-containing residual SWI\/SNF complex, suggesting the importance of dual inhibition of SMARCA2 and SMARCA4. While SMARCA4 is known to play a vital role in maintaining the oncogenic transcription program and driving proliferation in leukemia, the impact of dual SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 inhibition\/degradation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is largely unexplored.<br \/><b>Methods and Results:<\/b> As part of the initial design plan, selective SMARCA2\/4 Bromodomain inhibitors and specific ligands of several E3 ligases were chosen to arrive at different degrader designs. A choice of linkers and different exit vectors were considered to construct a variety of hetero bifunctional molecules. Our proprietary ternary complex modeling algorithm, ALMOND (ALgorithm for MOdeling Neosubstrate Degraders) helped in prioritizing the designs. Short listed compounds were synthesized and profiled in multiple cellular assays to understand their degradation potential. Several compounds that degrade SMARCA2, SMARCA4 &#38; PBRM1 with pico molar DC<sub>50<\/sub> were identified. These compounds have shown very potent anti-proliferative activity in both SMARCA2\/4 proficient (MV-4-11, VCaP etc) and SMARCA4 mutant cell lines (SK-MEL-5 &#38; RERF-LC-A1 etc). Further, potent compounds were optimized for their pharmacokinetic properties. Multiple lead compounds with low IV clearance and good oral bioavailability in rodents were identified. Advanced lead compounds are currently being evaluated in rodent tolerability and PK-PD experiments to select doses for the efficacy study.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Highly potent degraders of SMARCA2, SMARCA4 &#38; PBRM1 were identified by conjugating selective SMARCA2\/4 Bromodomain inhibitors and several E3 ligase specific ligands. Further optimization of the linkers resulted in compounds with improved pharmacokinetic profile and very good oral bioavailability in rodents. Highly potent and orally available degraders of SMARCA2, SMARCA4 are efficacious in AML xenograft models and advanced profiling of candidate molecule is in progress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d67a6082-c220-49f0-88f5-4ad7d3ec6f3c\/@w03B8ZK1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Transcriptional regulation,SWI\/SNF,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17274"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chandrasekhar Abbineni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leena Khare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bilash Kuila<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdul Rawoof Khaji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhaytadak Bhagwan Mahadeo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandeep Vitthal Dukare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhagya M S Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suraj T Gore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vijay Kamal Ahuja<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amit A Dhudashiya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raghavendra N R<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nagesh Gowda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charamanna K B<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kiran Aithal B<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samiulla D S<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subhendu Mukherjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Antony<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjeev Giri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shekar Chelur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kavitha Nellore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Girish Daginakatte<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murali Ramachandra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Susanta Samajdar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, there is increasing evidence that FA can promote the progression of established colorectal cancers (CRC); therefore, great care is required in the case of its application. In order to gain knowledge about the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the genomic and the epigenomic effect of different FA supplies on two CRC cell lines with distinct molecular backgrounds. HT-29 and SW480 cells were kept in FA-free media (0 ng\/mL) or treated with 100 ng\/mL and 10000 ng\/mL FA for 72 hours. Firstly, cell proliferation and cell viability alterations were determined with Supforhodamine B and AlamarBlue assays; then, cell cycle analysis was performed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Global DNA methylation level was investigated with the pyrosequencing of long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons. Micronucleus scoring performed on DAPI- and anti-&#947;-H2AX-stained slides, as well as Comet assay, were used to detect the impact of FA on genome integrity. Finally, we analyzed gene expression alterations with Human Transcriptome Array (HTA) 2.0. Our data revealed that 100 ng\/mL FA induced significant (<i>p<\/i>&#8804;0.05) elevation (HT-29<sub>100<\/sub>: 128.4&#177;24.9%) of HT-29 cell proliferation compared to the other two circumstances (HT-29<sub>0<\/sub>: 101.3&#177;13.5%; HT-29<sub>10000<\/sub>: 86.1&#177;20.8%). The tendency of cell viability was analogous to the results detected during cell proliferation analyses (HT-29<sub>0<\/sub>: 91.6&#177;13.3%; HT-29<sub>100<\/sub>: 115.8&#177;30.9%; HT-29<sub>10000<\/sub>: 64.1&#177;20.2%). The genomic stability of FA-supplemented HT-29 samples was improved in a significant manner (<i>p<\/i>&#8804;0.05), based on the results of micronucleus scoring (HT-29<sub>0<\/sub>: 0.56&#177;0.05%; HT-29<sub>100<\/sub>: 0.17&#177;0.05%; HT-29<sub>10000<\/sub>: 0.25&#177;0.09%) and Comet assay (HT-29<sub>0<\/sub>: 37.4&#177;3.5%; HT-29<sub>100<\/sub>: 31.2&#177;3.4%; HT-29<sub>10000<\/sub>: 20.1&#177;3.6%). However, in SW480 cells, remarkable alterations were not detected concerning these parameters. Fundamental differences were observed between the two cell lines in the case of cell cycle (HT-29: G0\/1 phase dominance; SW480: S phase dominance) and global DNA methylation analysis (HT-29: 59.1&#177;1.0; SW480: 49.0&#177;0.2), but exposing them to different FA doses did not lead to significant changes. Gene expression alterations were more diverse, as genes involved in carcinogenesis were either up- (<i>HES1<\/i>, <i>SLC7A11<\/i>) or downregulated (<i>CCL2<\/i>) for FA supplementation. We concluded that the effect of FA was considerably influenced by the cell type and the applied FA concentration. Thereby, translating our in vitro results to patient care, we would emphasize the importance of genetic and epigenetic investigations coupled with the choice of proper FA dose upon CRC diagnosis to achieve the best disease outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/61cba7c0-e4b2-4664-af93-99d097a536f2\/@w03B8ZK1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Folate,Cell lines,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17275"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sára Zsigrai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Kalmár<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Kinga Barták<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zsófia Brigitta Nagy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krisztina Andrea Szigeti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gábor Valcz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Titanilla Dankó<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Sebestyén<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gábor Barna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zsolt Tulassay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Péter Igaz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>István Takács<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Béla Molnár<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here, I used an unbiased genetic screening approach to examine resistance and sensitivity of breast cancer cells to Natural Killer (NK) cells. Among expected hits including caspases, interferon receptors, and cell death executioners, the screen revealed a surprising role of alternate SWI\/SNF complexes in controlling NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity that relate to interferon-&#947; and perforin\/granzyme B, and may be pharmacologically reversible.
