Inhibition of CSNK1A1 has previously been validated as a therapeutic strategy in hematologic malignancy, and degradation of CSNK1A1 protein is the downstream mechanism of action for lenalidomide in 5q- myelodysplasia (Kr&#246;nke, et al. Nature. 2015.). However, lenalidomide is inactive in most solid tumor models, thus limiting the study of CSNK1A1 inhibition in other contexts. Analysis of genetic loss-of-function data from the Cancer Dependency Map reveals multiple sensitive models, including lineage-specific enrichment in colorectal and gastric cancer. In an academic-industry collaboration, we a) developed first-in-class potent and selective ATP-competitive CSNK1A1 small molecule inhibitors with preclinical anti-cancer efficacy <i>in vivo,<\/i> and b) identified FAM83 expression as a key determinant of inhibitor sensitivity.<br \/>We identified a tetrahydro-pyrrolopyridinone scaffold that was subsequently optimized to yield BAY-888 (CSNK1A1 IC<sub>50<\/sub> 4 nM @ 10 &#956;M ATP; 63 nM @ 1 mM ATP) and BAY-204 (CSNK1A1 IC<sub>50<\/sub> 2 nM @ 10 &#956;M ATP; 12 nM @ 1 mM ATP). The crystal structure of CSNK1A1 in complex with BAY-888 confirmed compound binding in the ATP binding pocket. Across the PRISM barcoded cell line panel of more than 500 solid tumor cell lines, inhibitors phenocopy the CSNK1A1 shRNA knockdown profile. To determine downstream mediators of CSNK1A1 inhibitor sensitivity, we performed co-IP mass spectrometry following CSNK1A1 pulldown and global phosphoproteomic assays following inhibitor treatment. We identified multiple interacting proteins that are also phosphorylation targets, including FAM83 family members. FAM83 was recently reported to mediate the subcellular localization of CSNK1A1 (Fulcher, et al. Sci Signal. 2018.). Excitingly, the baseline expression of FAM83B and FAM83H correlates with inhibitor and shRNA cell line sensitivity. Modulation of FAM83H expression altered CSNK1A1 localization and sensitivity to CSNK1A1 inhibition.<br \/>BAY-888 and BAY-204 are orally bioavailable and were evaluated in multiple murine cell line xenograft models. We observed promising efficacy in DLBCL (TMD8) <i>in vivo <\/i>as well as in multiple FAM83-high solid tumor models, including colorectal (HCT116 and HT29), gastric (IM95), and urothelial cancer (KU19-19). We identified RPS6 phosphorylation as one of the PD biomarkers correlating with efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>. In summary, CSNK1A1 is a promising target with anti-tumor efficacy and achievable therapeutic index in preclinical models of FAM83-high solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,Drug discovery,Cancer therapy,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Steven M.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which inhibit immune responses in the tumor microenvironment via multiple suppressive mechanisms, have been proposed to play a key role in those patients who are not responding to CPI therapy. Therefore, targeted depletion of Tregs should promote more effective antitumor immunity. CCR8 is a chemokine receptor that is selectively expressed on highly activated human tumor-resident Tregs, and these intratumoral CCR8+ Tregs have been shown to drive immunosuppression that leads to poor prognosis for cancer patients. Here, we demonstrate that CCR8 is highly expressed on intratumoral FoxP3+ Treg cells in multiple cancers and is absent on other major immune cell populations in tumor microenvironment including effector T cells, conventional CD4 T cells, B cells, NK cells, some FoxP3+ cells, and myeloid cells. Importantly, no CCR8 protein expression was observed on any peripheral human leukocyte subset examined. These results provide strong rationale for targeting CCR8 as a cancer immunotherapy by selectively depleting the most suppressive intratumoral Treg cells.<br \/>We have developed a humanized therapeutic antibody, ZL-1218, that binds to human CCR8 with high affinity and specificity and can induce potent ADCC activity enabling strong NK cell-mediated killing of CCR8-expressing Tregs. We show that in human CCR8 knock-in mouse models bearing syngeneic tumors, ZL-1218 reduces intratumoral Treg cells and thus elicits significant tumor growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. We have recently explored the potential for ZL-1218 in combination immunotherapy, examining the enhanced antitumor activity when ZL-1218 is combined with anti-PD-1. Using human dissociated tumor samples, we further observed that different tumor types may induce different CCR8 expression levels on intratumoral Tregs leading to multiple, distinct CCR8+ subsets in various indications. We are currently exploring the significance of these distinct populations and the impact of ZL-1218-mediated depletion of both CCR8 high- and CCR8 low-expressing subsets in multiple indications. Together, these data support the advancement of ZL-1218 into clinical evaluation as a novel therapeutic candidate to treat human solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Regulatory T cells,Antibody,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenhua Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinchuan Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongshui Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shou Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lina Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bee-Chun Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica You<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivian Morton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiuping Ye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lishan Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bing Wan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Brams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>David I.

The survival rate is low (5-year survival &#60;20%), most non-palliative patients relapse within two years, and treatments in the advanced setting are limited. While FGFR2 and IDH1 inhibitors are effective in patients with select genomic alterations, they address only a small fraction (&#60;20%) of biliary tract cancers. We now present the discovery and characterization of ZB131, a first in class humanized monoclonal antibody targeted to cancer specific plectin (CSP). CSP is a pro-tumorigenic protein exclusively expressed on the cancer cell surface. Previously, we demonstrated remarkable tumor regressions in preclinical murine models of pancreatic and ovarian cancer using a tool anti-CSP murine antibody. Here, we show that intra- and extra-hepatic CCA are 92% and 86% positive for membranous plectin staining by IHC, respectively, suggesting that anti-CSP therapy could be broadly effective against CCA. Indeed, in CCA cell lines in vitro, ZB131 (0.4nM binding affinity) arrests cell cycle, inhibits cell migration, and triggers intracellular ROS accumulation. In addition, both ZB131 and its murine version significantly suppressed tumor growth in 83% of the mice in a xenograft model and caused complete regression in the remaining 17%. Previous data from our group and others suggesting that CSP plays a role in chemoresistance led us to evaluate the efficacy of ZB131 in combination with gemcitabine. In vitro, we treated CSP-positive WITT cells with combinations of 0-500nM gemcitabine plus 0-1000nM ZB131 and found pockets of synergy or additivity. In a CCA xenograft model, the combination of 1mg\/kg ZB131 and 100mg\/kg gemcitabine showed 91% suppression in tumor growth compared with 74% in gemcitabine alone and 77% in huIgG plus gemcitabine at day 32. Collectively, our results suggest that ZB131 renders CCA tumors more chemosensitive and enhances the antitumor effects of gemcitabine. In contrast to the standard-of-care CCA treatment regimen, ZB131 showed remarkably low toxicity, likely because the antibody bypasses any non-malignant cells where plectin remains strictly cytoplasmic. Fc effector functional studies revealed a lack of antibody-dependent cell-mediated and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Hemolysis and cytokine release studies suggested that ZB131 is compatible with human blood and unlikely to cause adverse cytokine release. Furthermore, in GLP toxicology studies, no signs of toxicity were observed at the highest dose evaluated of 100mg\/kg\/week, providing a &#62;30-fold safety margin from the estimated human efficacious dose of 3mg\/kg\/week. In summary, ZB131 is an exciting new avenue for the treatment of CCA and other CSP-positive cancers with an excellent safety profile and strong antitumor activity in vitro and in murine models. Phase I clinical trials of ZB131 have been initiated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor activity,Ovarian cancer,Pancreatic cancer,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Samantha M.

The switch\/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI\/SNF) is a multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complex that uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to reposition or eject nucleosomes at non-coding regulatory elements, thereby enabling access to the underlying DNA for transcriptional activation. Notably, the SWI\/SNF complex plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and is recurrently altered in over 20% of human cancers, with the revised complex in cancer cells enabling central oncogenic gene programs. Yet, no studies have assessed the therapeutic efficacy of complete SWI\/SNF inactivation across human cancers. Here, we developed a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degrader of ATPase subunits of the SWI\/SNF complex, SMARCA2 and SMARCA4. In a panel with over 90 normal and cancer cell lines from 18 different lineages, we found MYC-driven multiple myeloma and androgen receptor (AR)\/forkhead box A1 (FOXA1)-positive prostate and breast cancers to be preferentially sensitive to dual SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 degradation relative to benign prostate as well as other cancer cell lines, including cancer cell lines with inactivating SMARCA4 mutations. We found complete SWI\/SNF ATPase degradation to instantaneously compact the <i>cis<\/i>-regulatory elements that are bound and activated by transcription factors that drive cancer proliferation, namely MYC, IRF4, TCF3, AR, FOXA1, and ERG. This ensued in parallel untethering of these oncogenic drivers from the chromatin, with subsequent chemical decommissioning of their core enhancer circuitry and attenuation of downstream gene programs. Furthermore, using chromatin conformation assays we found SWI\/SNF inactivation to disrupt super-enhancer and promoter DNA looping interactions that wire supra-physiologic expression of the <i>MYC, AR, ERG, IRF4, <\/i>and<i> TCF3<\/i> oncogenes themselves, thereby tempering their expression in cancer cells. Treatment with the SMARCA2\/4 degrader alone induced potent inhibition of tumor growth in cell line-derived xenograft models of multiple myeloma, as well as prostate cancer, and synergized with AR antagonists, inducing disease remission in several drug-resistant disease models. Notably, no major toxicities were seen in mice upon prolonged treatment with the SMARCA2\/4 degrader, including no indications of thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal goblet cell depletion, or germ cell degeneration&#8212;all being major toxicities associated with the BRD4-targeting therapeutics. To our knowledge, this study is the first preclinical proof of concept that targeted obstruction of chromatin accessibility at non-coding regulatory elements can be a potent therapeutic strategy in enhancer-addicted tumors, warranting the safety and efficacy assessments of SWI\/SNF inhibitors and degraders in human clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,SWI\/SNF,Multiple myeloma,PROTAC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Abhijit Parolia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lanbo Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuanyuan Qiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pushpinder Bawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjana Eyunni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eleanor Young<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Mannan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra E.

For severe CID, dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation of chemotherapy is often required, negatively impacting anticancer therapy. Cyclin-dependent kinases 4\/6 (CDK4\/6) regulate cell cycle G1\/S transition and can induce a &#8220;pharmacological quiescence&#8221; with transient administration. Recently, trilaciclib, an IV CDK4\/6 inhibitor prophylactically reduced chemotherapy-induced neutropenia without decreasing overall survival. Therefore, transient oral administration of a gut-restricted CDK4\/6 inhibitor, prior to the chemotherapy may slow\/inhibit intestinal stem\/epithelial cell cycling and thus, be prophylactic for CID without reducing chemotherapy efficacy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> PK was studied in Balb\/c mice given OQL051 (OQL, 50 mg\/kg) intra-gastrically. Blood samples were collected at pre- and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h post-dosing and centrifuged for plasma. Tissues (jejunum\/colon) were collected at 0.5, 2, and 6 h after OQL (n=3\/collection). Plasma and tissues were analyzed for OQL by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. CID was studied in 5 groups of Balb\/c mice (n=5\/group) given OQL vehicle (OQLV)+0.9%NaCl saline (NaCl), OQLV+5FU (175 mg\/kg) and OQL+5FU at 3 OQL doses (25, 50, and 100 mg\/kg) orally at 8 h prior and 4 h post an IP 5FU injection. In a second CID study, Balb\/c mice (controls as above, n=5\/group) were given OQL+5FU at 2 OQL doses (30 and 100 mg\/kg, n=5\/ dose) plus IP 5FU daily (70 mg\/kg) for 3 consecutive days. OQLV or OQL were given orally at 8 h prior and 4 h after each daily IP 5FU injection. OQL doses were given once more on the 4<sup>th<\/sup> day.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> OQL concentrations in the jejunum and colon were over 300 times greater than those in plasma (AUC 12017 and 10515 vs 32.1 ng&#183;h\/g, respectively). The 1-day in vivo CID study showed OQL decreased diarrhea grades by 67% to 83% (&#772;x&#772; (SE): OQLV\/NaCl 0.0 (0.0), OQLV\/5FU 1.2 (0.3), OQL 25mg 0.2 (0.2), OQL 50mg 0.4 (0.2), OQL 100mg 0.4 (0.4)). The 3-day in vivo study showed OQL decreased the diarrhea grades by 63% (&#772;x&#772; (SE): QOLV\/NaCl 0.0 (0.0), OQLV\/5FU 1.6 (0.5), OQL 30mg 0.6 (0.2), OQL 100mg 0.6 (0.7)). In the 5FU CID model, histological examination showed intestinal tissues\/epithelial cells had less edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and necrosis after OQL treatment compared with OQLV+5FU.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Oral administration of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor, OQL051, was restricted to the intestinal lining and reduced 5FU intestinal cell inflammation and necrosis. This resulted in a reduction in CID in a preclinical model and supports the potential for a prophylactic CID treatment in cancer patients without reducing their chemotherapy anticancer efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Differentiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Chemotherapy,Drug design,Cytotoxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Wemqin Zeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenxi Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shilan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Robert Claude Tyler<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiyi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

With few treatment options, typically resulting in only transient responses, SCLC is responsible for approximately 250,000 deaths globally per year. The backbone of SCLC treatment over the past several decades has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, with the recent addition of immunotherapy to first-line chemotherapy showing limited benefit in a small subset of patients. Major hurdles to improving SCLC treatment include development of rapid chemoresistance and ineffective second line therapies. The identification of more durably effective therapeutic strategies is a major unmet clinical need. Here, we performed an <i>in vitro<\/i> CRISPR screen in SCLC cell lines from all major SCLC subtypes, including short-term cultured cells from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), to identify potential therapeutic targets to enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy. Candidate hits were validated genetically and pharmacologically with <i>in vitro<\/i> synergy assays, <i>in vivo<\/i> clonal competition assays and pharmacologic assessments in PDX models. Signaling pathways were studied by RNA sequencing and western blot, and toxicity studies were performed<i> in vivo<\/i> to assess the safety of the agents at pharmacologically effective doses. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess expression of candidate targets in tissue microarrays (TMAs). Our CRISPR screen revealed<i> <\/i>the nuclear exporter exportin 1 (encoded by the<i> XPO1<\/i> gene) as a promising target sensitizing to chemotherapy, independently of the SCLC subtype. We found that <i>XPO1<\/i> mRNA expression was higher in SCLC than in any other solid tumor or hematological malignancy, and demonstrated consistently high protein expression by IHC in clinical TMAs. A potent and selective exportin 1 inhibitor, selinexor, is approved for use in hematological malignancies. Combination of selinexor with cisplatin or irinotecan demonstrated synergy <i>in vitro<\/i> and efficacy i<i>n vivo<\/i> in an array of chemon&#228;ive and chemoresistant SCLC PDXs, including all major SCLC subtypes. The combinations were well tolerated in mice. The chemo-sensitizing effects of selinexor were associated with suppression of chemotherapy-induced AKT activation. In conclusion, exportin 1 inhibition strongly enhances sensitivity of SCLC tumors to cisplatin and irinotecan, used in first line and second line treatment of SCLC tumors, respectively, and these effects are independent of the SCLC subtype. These results provide preclinical rationale for the combination of selinexor with cisplatin or irinotecan in na&#239;ve and relapsed SCLC. The clinical availability of selinexor will allow rapid clinical translation of these results in a disease setting with extremely limited therapeutic options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Chemotherapy,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alvaro Quintanal-Villalonga<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirokazu Taniguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Chow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingqian A.
