[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>The majority of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) are insensitive to anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) antibodies. While there are many causes for ICI insensitivity, recent studies suggest that the suppression of innate immunity through a loss of innate immune adaptor expression could be a root cause of this insensitivity and an important factor in the evolution of tumor immunosuppression.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We interrogated mitochondrial antiviral signaling gene (MAVS) expression through bioinformatics analyses of multiple datasets to validate its suppression in clinical samples. We then engineered MAVS expressing tumor cells and tested its ability to elicit innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity using both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> approaches, which we then confirmed using MAVS expressing viral vectors. Finally, we observed that MAVS stimulated PD-L1expression in different types of tumor cells and then assessed the combination of PD-L1 ICI antibodies with MAVS tumor expression <i>in vivo<\/i>.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b> MAVS was significantly downregulated in CRCs, but its re-expression could stimulate broad cellular interferon-related responses, in both murine and patient-derived CRCs. <i>In vivo<\/i>, local MAVS expression elicited significant anti-tumor responses in both immune-sensitive and insensitive CRC models, through the stimulation of an interferon responsive axis that elicited tumor antigen-specific adaptive immunity. Critically, we found that tumor-intrinsic MAVS expression triggered systemic adaptive immune responses that enabled abscopal CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity against distant CRCs. As MAVS also induced PD-L1 expression, we further found synergistic anti-tumor responses in combination with anti-PD-L1 ICIs.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>These data demonstrate that intratumoral MAVS expression results in local and systemic tumor antigen-specific T cell responses, which could be combined with PD-L1 ICI to permit effective anti-tumor immunotherapy in ICI resistant cancers. We are further exploring to overcome the ICI insensitivity of other types of solid tumor, with MAVS-delivery strategies other than viral vectors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9f346e8d-906a-4af7-917e-044621eec85e\/@C03B8ZPB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Innate immunity,Interferons,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17136"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bin-Jin Hwang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li-Chung Tsao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chaitanya Acharya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Trotter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pankaj Agarwal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junping Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao-Yi Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gang-jun Lei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takuya Osada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Herbert Kim Lyerly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael A.

Neutralizing their role in modulating the immune landscape could be the key to enhancing immunotherapy success. Imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors with several kinase targets.<b><br \/>Methods:<\/b> Tissue microarrays spanning 153 patients were stained for &#945;SMA, TAGLN, PDPN, ICAM1, and CD8. CD8 stains were quantified as number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes per high powered field (TILs\/HPF) in the epithelial compartment. All other stains were quantified by intensity on a 0-3+ scale. Scores for &#945;SMA and TAGLN were combined into a myCAF score, and PDPN and ICAM1 into an iCAF score. myCAF gene expression signatures derived from a re-analysis of scRNA-seq data previously done by our lab were entered into the LINCS database to discover potential drugs to reverse the phenotype. Primary cancer associated fibroblasts were derived from patient tumor samples, then treated with clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib for 96 hours. RNA was isolated and RT-qPCR was performed to quantify the myCAF genes <i>ACTA2<\/i>, <i>COL11A1, <\/i>and <i>TAGLN<\/i>, and the iCAF genes <i>ICAM1, PDPN, IL1R1, CXCL1 <\/i>and <i>CXCL2. TGFB1 <\/i>expression was also measured. Expression was normalized to untreated cells and <i>GAPDH <\/i>expression levels.<b><br \/>Results:<\/b> Cancers with high expression of myCAF markers but low expression of iCAF markers had the most CD8+ TILs (average 10.2; median 1.5; range 0-73), while cancers with low myCAF scores and high iCAF scores had the least (average 1.5; median 0; range 0-19; <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.01). Reversing the myCAF signature relative to iCAFs in the LINCs database revealed nilotinib as a top hit. Treatment with imatinib did not significantly alter the expression of myCAF genes (control vs. max dose: <i>p <\/i>= 0.06 for <i>ACTA2, COL11A1 p <\/i>=0.2, <i>TAGLN<\/i> <i>p <\/i>= 1), while treatment with dasatinib significantly increased these genes (<i>ACTA2 <\/i>1.4x higher, <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.001; <i>COL11A1 <\/i>2.6x higher, <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.01; <i>TAGLN <\/i>1.5x higher, <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.001). Only treatment with nilotinib significantly decreased myCAF genes (<i>ACTA2 <\/i>2.2x lower, <i>p <\/i>&#60;0.001; <i>COL11A1 <\/i>1.3x lower, <i>p <\/i>=0.05; <i>TAGLN <\/i>1.9x lower, <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.01). All three drugs decreased iCAF gene <i>CXCL1<\/i>, and all but dasatinib decreased <i>CXCL2<\/i>.

Up to 30% of human lung tumors contain a mutation that results in constitutive NRF2 pathway activation, which contributes to cancer cell survival, disease progression, and resistance to chemotherapies. However, the effects of NRF2 activation in immune cells within the tumor microenvironment are underexplored. Macrophages in lung cancers contribute to cancer progression or regression depending on the context, and NRF2 activity affects macrophage activation and trafficking. To evaluate the role of NRF2 activity in macrophages, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from NRF2 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice were treated to induce anti-tumor (M1), tumor-promoting (M2), and tumor-educated macrophage phenotypes and then treated with the potent NRF2 activator CDDO-Methyl ester (CDDO-Me), also known as bardoxolone methyl. In tumor-educated BMDMs isolated from NRF2 WT mice and cultured in conditioned media from lung cancer cells, CDDO-Me (100 nM) induced a 3-fold increase in mRNA expression of the M1 markers TNF-&#945; and IL-6. The expression of these cytokines was not increased by CDDO-Me in tumor-educated BMDMs isolated from NRF2 KO mice. CDDO-Me also decreased mRNA expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF and the chemokine CCL2 in tumor-educated BMDMs isolated from WT but not NRF2 KO mice. VEGF is expressed by tumor-promoting macrophages and CCL2, a chemotactic factor that recruits M2 macrophages into the lung, is a biomarker of poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. CDDO-Me has potent anti-tumor effects in the A\/J mouse model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the mechanism of these effects was unknown. To evaluate, A\/J WT and NRF2 KO A\/J mice were injected with vinyl carbamate to initiate lung tumors. Two weeks later, mice were fed either a control diet or a diet containing CDDO-Me (50 mg\/kg diet: ~12.5 mg\/kg body weight) for 16 weeks. Ultrasound confirmed the development of tumors in the lungs of mice throughout the study, and differences in tumor number and lung parenchyma structure were detected at 15 weeks of treatment. CDDO-Me significantly (p&#60;0.05) decreased tumor burden in WT A\/J mice. Tumor burden in the NRF2 KO mice was significantly (p&#60;0.05) higher than in WT mice, irrespective of treatment. Tumor count in NRF2 KO A\/J mice treated with either vehicle or CDDO-Me was increased 2-fold compared to WT A\/J mice on the vehicle control diet. These data show that CDDO-Me promotes an anti-cancer macrophage phenotype <i>in vitro <\/i>that is dependent on NRF2 activation. Additionally, NRF2 KO increases lung tumor burden in the A\/J model of NSCLC and CDDO-Me significantly decreases tumor burden in A\/J mice in a NRF2-dependent manner. Future studies will test the effect of CDDO-Me and NRF2 activity on the lung tumor immune microenvironment <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d186cb19-ef56-47d0-b40b-79e18b2fe026\/@u03B8ZPC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nrf2,NSCLC,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17139"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jess Ann Moerland<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen T.

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that Axl is a critical driver of survival, proliferation, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance in HNC, and that MerTK is functionally redundant to Axl. In this study, we investigated the cooperative role of Axl and MerTK in creating an immunologically cold tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) by targeting both receptors simultaneously with a small molecule inhibitor of Axl and MerTK (INCB081776). Because Axl and MerTK are expressed on both macrophages and HNC cancer cells, we examined the effect of INCB081776 treatment on each cell type. In macrophages, Axl and MerTK signaling leads to M2-type polarization, an anti-inflammatory state that leads to the resolution of inflammation and, in cancer settings, promotes tumor growth. Our experiments suggest that treatment with INCB081776 can reduce M2 polarization and increase M1-type polarization, a pro-inflammatory state that promotes inflammation and tumor cell killing. Next, to determine the efficacy of INCB081776 on HNC cancer cells, mouse oral cancer (MOC) tumors were implanted in syngeneic mice and treated with INCB081776 alone or in combination with a monoclonal antibody against PDL1 (anti-PDL1), thereby mimicking current standard-of-care immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. The results showed a marked effect of INCB081776 single-agent treatment on MOC tumor growth and an increase in several pro-inflammatory cell types (M1 macrophages, CD8+ T cells, total infiltrating leukocytes), suggesting that INCB081776 treatment can create an immunologically hot TIME. Further, in-depth analysis of tumor infiltrating leukocytes following INCB081776 treatment in both immunologically hot (MOC1) and cold (MOC2) HNC tumors suggested that INCB081776 has a greater effect in cold tumors. In cold tumors, levels of pro-inflammatory cells (CD8+ T cells, M1 macrophages, etc.) increased, and levels of anti-inflammatory cells (M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells, etc.) decreased, both to a greater extent than in hot tumors. Finally, the combination of INCB081776 and anti-PDL1 was superior to either treatment alone in slowing tumor growth. Together, these studies indicate that INCB081776 cooperates with anti-PDL1 in a syngeneic mouse model of HNC to slow tumor growth and create a pro-inflammatory environment, especially in immunologically cold tumors, thereby highlighting the potential clinical benefit of this therapeutic combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ca465fe-6fba-4314-9d69-b1caf88f61e2\/@u03B8ZPC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),Tumor microenvironment,Axl,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17140"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kourtney L.

The general methods comprise developing a cancer cell monolayer then overlaying it with T cells, or, worse, pre-mixing cancer cells with T cells before placing the mixture into culture wells\/dishes. Such methods obviously force cancer cell-T cell interactions. This is not physiological, since T cells must migrate to tumors for cancer cell killing to even occur. Migration is a little-explored, yet central parameter ignored in 2D killing assays. There is no tumor cell killing by T cells if there is no T cell migration, biased or unbiased. Our work making use of novel 3D multi-compartments organoids systems identifies key molecules regulating pathways for T cell migration in 3D. We are currently testing molecules currently FDA-approved or in clinical trials that block or enhance T cell killing of cancer cells by blocking or enhancing T cell migration through a first-of-its-kind 3D killing assay that we developed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cbf96660-89a7-4afa-8803-3fbf80f03f5c\/@u03B8ZPC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,T cell,Organoids,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17141"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adrian Johnston<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frisco Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zeqi Wan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cameron Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeongseo Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Bessiake<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Praful Nair<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pei-Hsun Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denis Wirtz<\/i><\/presenter>.

Tumor reliance on glycolysis is emerging as a mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy, due in part to lactate-mediated immunosuppression and competition for glucose between effector T cells and tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are associated with poor outcomes in cancer patients, and we observed that serum lactate and LDH levels correlate with primary tumor burden in mice. We recently demonstrated that genetic dampening of LDH subunit A in 4T1 TNBC results in improved and long-lasting anti-tumor responses to CTLA-4 blockade in mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that combining LDH inhibitors (LDHi) with CTLA-4 blockade will be an effective strategy to combat resistance to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Since activated T cells rely on glycolysis, we first determined that glycolytic cancers overexpress LDH (compared with immune cells) by analyzing single-cell transcripts from patient melanoma biopsies. LDHA gene expression is significantly higher in malignant cells than infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and we replicated these findings at the protein level in whole cell lysate from B16-F10 melanoma and 4T1 TNBC tumor cells and tumor-antigen specific T cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. We show that LDHi reduces tumor lactate production and glucose consumption without inhibiting anti-tumor T-cell killing <i>in vitro<\/i>. The anti-tumor effect of LDH inhibition requires adaptive immunity, as daily treatment with LDHi results in reduced tumor burden in immunocompetent but not immune-deficient mice. Finally, we show that targeting LDH in combination with CTLA-4 blockade is more effective in slowing B16-F10 growth compared with CTLA-4 blockade alone, and that this combination promotes effector T cell activation while destabilizing regulatory T cell function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5fa3cd84-07e3-4d7e-b4d0-022d24d8180b\/@u03B8ZPC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Immune checkpoint blockade,CTLA-4,Glycolysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17143"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Svena Verma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inna Serganova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadna Budhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myat Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Levi Mangarin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taha Merghoub<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jedd Wolchok<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberta Zappasodi<\/i><\/presenter>.

ETBs are large molecule proteins consisting of an antibody fragment genetically fused to a proprietary de-immunized (DI) form of the Shiga-like toxin-1 subunit A (SLTA). Once engaged to the specific cell surface target of interest, ETBs internalize, route to the cytosol, and permanently inactivate ribosomes through an irreversible enzymatic process. This results in cell death via apoptotic mechanisms.<br \/>Here we describe the preclinical characterization of a candidate CTLA-4-targeted ETB. The candidate ETB kills gain-of-function model cell lines that express CTLA-4 at levels observed on primary human tumor Tregs. Notably, the potency of the candidate ETB is limited when CTLA-4 is expressed at low levels, thereby allowing a mechanism to spare CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and effector CD4+ T cells from targeted depletion. The candidate ETB binds CTLA-4 with high affinity utilizing a unique biparatopic binding domain. Using in vitro systems, we show that the candidate ETB can block CTLA-4:B7 interactions and repress Treg-mediated T-cell suppression. In a syngeneic mouse pharmacodynamic model, the candidate ETB depletes tumor-resident Tregs and increases the CD8:Treg ratio in the TME. A toxicological study in naive NHP demonstrate that the candidate ETB, which is cross-reactive to NHP, is well-tolerated at 450 mcg\/kg (highest dose tested) administered intravenously once weekly for 4-weeks and does not significantly alter the CTLA-4 low\/null peripheral T cell populations. Overall, the candidate ETB is a unique CTLA-4 targeting modality that is designed to deplete Tregs selectively and directly in the tumor, spare CD8+ CTLs, and represents an alternative treatment option to traditional blocking antibodies. Development activities are underway to support the upcoming IND application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b52eba10-a434-4f0c-9053-9ff5b86924e8\/@v03B8ZPD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,CTLA-4,Immunotoxin,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17144"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Asis Sarkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Martin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren R.

Recent clinical advancements in both cell-directed and antibody therapies for B-cell leukemias demonstrate the importance of the immune system in eliciting anti-leukemia activity. Yet, there are still patients who suffer relapse with these treatments, which underscores the need to better understand immune evasion by leukemia cells and the need to develop more effective therapies.<br \/>Although IL-12 has been well-studied in the context of pathogenic infections and immune cells,<sup> <\/sup>we previously published that IL-12 potently promotes B-ALL clearance in immune competent mice via increased T-cell activation. To further characterize the role of IL-12 in leukemia control, we examined the bone marrow of immune competent mice with B-ALL using an extensive flow cytometry panel. From these studies, we observed both an increase in T-cell and dendritic cell (DC) numbers and augmented DC activation in rIL-12p70 treated WT mice. Furthermore, rIL-12p70 treatment of WT mice with B-ALL exhibited increased GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-1&#946;, CXCL2, CCL12, and IFN-gamma levels in the bone marrow microenvironment. In these experiments, we also analyzed gene expression profiles in T-cells. The expression of exhaustion-associated genes, including <i>Lag3, Pcdc1,<\/i> and <i>Tigit<\/i>, was higher in T-cells recovered from untreated mice with B-ALL relative to those from mice without leukemia. These data are consistent with observations made from single cell RNA-sequencing studies of children with B-ALL, where it was revealed that immune cell exhaustion was present at higher levels in those with measurable disease after induction therapy. Treatment of mice with IL-12 abrogated the leukemia induced increases in exhaustion-associated gene expression.<br \/>Mechanistically, we observed that when T-cells are stimulated <i>in vitro<\/i> in B-ALL supernatant there is a reduction in the surface expression of the T-cell activation marker, CD44, and marker of degranulation, CD107b. Jurkat T-cells expressing NFAT or NF-kB reporter plasmids were used to assess activation of T-cell signaling pathways. In addition to suppressing CD44 and CD107b, we also found that B-ALL-secreted factors also suppress the activation of signaling pathways downstream of the TCR.<br \/>Considering clinical implications of this discovery, we further explored IL-12 <i>ex vivo<\/i> in combination with the clinically approved bi-specific T-cell engager, blinatumomab. Notably, B-ALL-secreted factors reduced blinatumomab-mediated T-cell lysis of target cells, which was restored with recombinant IL-12 treatment.<br \/>Overall, this data shows the potential for IL-12 to be used as an immunotherapeutic in conjunction with other current therapies to overcome T-cell suppression by B-ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/129640f2-a4a3-45f2-9b48-04ed66273774\/@w03B8ZPE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-12,Immunomodulation,T cell,BiTE antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17145"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rae Hunter<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathleen Imbach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jodi Dougan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priscilla Do<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Townsel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik Dreaden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Gibson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Curtis Henry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Porter<\/i><\/presenter>.

The standard of care for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) involves intravesical immunotherapy with Bacillus Calmette Gu&#233;rin (BCG). However, it is possible that the efficacy of this modality of BCG administration is suboptimal, as most patients do not respond fully to this immunotherapy. Furthermore, our current understanding of the immunotherapeutic effect of BCG is incomplete. Using a mouse model of NMIBC, we compared the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) following intravesical versus intravenous administration of BCG, as well as changes in tumor volume and mice survival.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Female C57Bl\/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were catheterized and instilled with 2.5x105 MB49 bladder cancer cells after poly-L-lysine treatment. Beginning on day 7, mice were treated with intravenous (IV) or intravesical BCG (8 mg\/ml) or saline once weekly for three weeks. Ultrasound was performed weekly to monitor tumor growth. Similarly, a cohort of non-tumor bearing mice was treated with poly-L-lysine on day one followed by three weekly intravesical instillations of BCG. In both cohorts, mice were sacrificed on day 23 and bladders were harvested, enzymatically dispersed to generate single-cell suspensions for analysis by flow cytometry, or snap frozen for transcriptomic analysis using NanoString nCounter Platform.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Mice receiving IV BCG had better survival and their bladder tumors were significantly smaller compared with mice receiving intravesical BCG. This reduction in tumor size was associated with a significantly increased proportion of CD8+ T cells and a significantly reduced proportion of inflammatory monocytes in bladder tumors from mice treated with IV BCG compared with intravesical BCG. Whole tumor transcriptome analysis revealed alterations in various signalling pathways associated with route of BCG administration. Our results demonstrate similar trends in the distribution of immune populations in the TiME following intravesical saline and IV BCG treatment, as well as following IV saline and intravesical BCG treatment. We also found that the TiME after intravesical BCG treatment has more immune cells which are predominantly immature myeloid cells. Moreover, our results indicate that intravesical BCG treatment leads to a significant population of immature myeloid cells in the bladders of non-tumor bearing mice.<br \/><b>Conclusion\/Significance<\/b>: These results provide evidence that the route of BCG administration is an important determinant of the TiME composition and may influence anti-tumor responses. Understanding the link between the TiME and BCG therapy may facilitate the development of new approaches to improve outcomes and reduce recurrence rates in patients with NMIBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a20f2f3-1c7d-4b0e-b26d-190994a0ceb8\/@w03B8ZPE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG),Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17146"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aline Atallah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arielle Grossman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Francois Pare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Siemens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiziana Cotechini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles H.

Incorporation of diverse cellular players, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and suppressive myeloid cell populations, allows for faithful recapitulation of complex cellular interactions that occur in the tumor micro-environment (TME). The application of automation results in a high throughput platform which combines physiological relevance with assay robustness and reproducibility. Functional read-outs, such as migration of immune cells towards tumoroids, infiltration into the tumoroids and their killing are obtained by applying high content imaging, allowing for better understanding of the immune-modulatory profile of IO drugs. Here, we have applied image analysis to quantify the effects of different antibodies and small molecules targeting both the tumor and the T cells.<br \/>MATERIAL and METHODS: Tumoroids generated from breast and colon cancer organoids and cell lines were cultured in protein hydrogel. Partially HLA-matching T cells isolated from healthy PBMCs donors were added with or without activation to the 3D culture after incorporation of different suppressive populations, including CAFs and M2 macrophages. The capacity of effector T cells to infiltrate and subsequently kill tumor structures was visualized using high-content microscopy and quantified with morphometric image analysis software after reconstitution of 3D image stacks.<br \/>RESULTS and DISCUSSION: Automated 3D image and data analysis enabled discrimination of cellular interactions in a complex TME model. Depending on the activation status of T cells and the presence of suppressive cells in the environment, different levels of infiltration and tumor killing by effector T cells were measured. The suppression induced on the T cells by the environment was partially reversed by immune-modulators (e.g. CSF1R inhibitor) added to the co-culture, which was confirmed by increased IFN&#947; levels in culture supernatants. Two quantitative read outs that are strictly dependent on the 3D environment; T cell infiltration into tumor and decrease in tumor volume were combined to demonstrate immune suppression release induced by different immuno-modulators.<br \/>CONCLUSION: Our image-based platform described here allows for analysis of immunotherapy effects on cells that engage in a physiologically relevant spatial setting and in the presence of suppressive TME elements. Visualization and quantification of these complex cellular interactions within the TME empowers immunotherapy drug developers with a highly powerful tool to select the most promising candidates and better understand their mechanism of action, which ultimately will have an impact in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e4c1d22b-b57d-4736-a7d2-5160bde2b8c3\/@x03B8ZPF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Immunosuppression,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17147"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lidia Daszkiewicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gera Goverse<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nataliia Beztsinna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saskia De Man<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomas Veenendaal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Klop<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Okkes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashgard Weterings<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kuan Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leo Price<\/i><\/presenter>.

Methods to augment the number and functionality of tumor-reactive T cells are therefore vital. Given that cytotoxic CD8 T cell priming requires conventional dendritic cells (cDC), we hypothesized that strategies to enhance cDC functionality in tumors would augment anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses. CD40 and type 1 IFN signaling pathways each promote the cross-presentation function of cDCs to activate CD8 T cells. However, it is unclear whether these pathways are functionally independent and whether their combined activation in tumor cDC leads to higher levels of T cell priming. Using adenovirus vectors, we tested the impact of expression of IFN&#946; and a chimeric membrane-stable CD40 ligand (MEM40) in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Compared to intratumoral administration of each individual transgene-encoding adenovirus, combined MEM40 + IFN&#946; expression resulted in the best tumor growth control, highest levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and systemic CD8 T cell responses. MEM40 and IFN&#946; were independently capable of enhancing T cell responses as we found IFN&#946; in CD40-\/- mice and MEM40 in type 1 IFN receptor IFNAR1-\/- mice induced a strong T cell response. These results were consistent with a cDC-mediated priming mechanism. Studies with cDC1 deficient BATF3-\/- mice revealed a crucial role of this cDC subset in MEM40 + IFN&#946; induced T cell responses. IFN&#946; alone and MEM40 + IFN&#946; triggered increase in lymph node (LN) homing receptor CCR7 expression in cDC1 concurrent with a reduction in cDC1 in tumors and gain in tumor draining LNs. Simultaneously, combined MEM40 + IFN&#946; combination led to the highest levels of expression of CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules in both tumor and LN cDC1. Single cell (sc)-RNA sequencing of tumor DCs further showed that MEM40 + IFN&#946; led to the highest proportion of a recently defined mature\/regulatory cDC subset characterized by high expression of <i>CCR7<\/i>, <i>CD40<\/i> and <i>IL12b<\/i>. Applying these results towards an effective therapeutic modality, we developed a dual-transgene-armed MEM40 + IFN&#946; expressing conditionally replicative adenovirus (MEM-288) that simultaneously confers tumor-specific oncolysis and promotes tumor antigen release. MEM-288 drives MEM40 + IFN&#946; expression in freshly resected human lung tumors and generates potent anti-tumor responses as a monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, MEM-288 induced enhancement of tumor-reactive TILs and provides a rationale for studies to determine whether MEM-288 pre-treatment generates a superior TIL product for more effective adoptive T cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c07f51c9-26ed-48e8-b70a-2b277dda504a\/@x03B8ZPF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Oncolytic adenovirus,Dendritic cells,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17148"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hong Zheng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Antonia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark J.

Currently approved PD-L1 targeted approaches rely on the blocking activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which sterically inhibit PD-L1 thus preventing PD-1 mediated immune checkpoint activity. Although these mAbs have shown activity in the clinic, the need for pre-existing tumor specific immunity and tumor immune infiltration precludes responses in some patients and leads to resistance in others. Therefore, there remains a need for new modalities and treatment paradigms. Molecular Templates has developed MT-6402, an engineered toxin body (ETB) targeting PD-L1 designed to overcome the challenges of current PD-L1 targeting approaches by 1) directly depleting PD-L1 positive tumor or immunosuppressive immune cells displaying PD-L1 and 2) alteration of the tumor immunophenotype through the cytoplasmic delivery of an HLA:A*02 restricted cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen. Delivery of this antigen is meant to leverage recruitment of existing CMV-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for cell-mediated cytotoxic depletion (antigen seeding technology, AST) of CMV antigen presenting tumor cells. MT-6402 is currently in a phase I open-label, dose escalation and expansion study in subjects with advanced solid cancers that express PD-L1 (NCT04795713). Initial assessment of pharmacodynamic markers for PD-L1 and CMV-mediated ETB activity in a subject with confirmed PD-L1+ tumor cells, CMV positivity, and HLA:A*02 restriction has shown serum phenotypes associated with robust checkpoint inhibitor activity and full extravasation of circulating CMV-specific T cells. In addition to assessing early clinical data from the HLA: A*02 restricted MT-6402 trials, expansion of ETB AST to a broader patient population requires testing of ETBs engineered with the ability to deliver CMV antigens across a broad range of HLA restriction, including HLA:A*01, HLA:A*03, and HLA:A*24. To this end, ETBs were benchmarked against MT-6402 to identify candidates that retain comparable specificity, selectivity, and activity. Substitution of peptide antigens did not alter specificity or selectivity of ETBs compared to MT-6402. Candidate ETB binding profiles and potency were comparable to MT-6402. ETBs delivered an antigen seeding response in a PD-L1 dependent and HLA specific manner. In vivo efficacy of candidate ETBs was comparable in a murine efficacy xenograft model with MT-6402. An ex vivo cytokine release assay in a co-culture setting using HLA matched CTLs and PD-L1+ target cells, treatment with AST capable ETBs resulted in secretion of antigen specific T cell mediated immune cytokines compared to AST null controls. These cytokines overlap with cytokine signatures observed after dosing MT-6402 in HLA:A*02 patients. Preclinical assessment of the safety profile of candidates is ongoing and further development is slated for 2021.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a76589d-cf2e-4f20-a35f-c7aef0221b9a\/@x03B8ZPF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Immunotoxin,Antigen presentation,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17149"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Swati Khanna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth M.

However, the cases where immunotherapies have been successful in breast cancer, the results have been remarkable: full remission of stage 4 disease has been observed. This highlights the need to elucidate how the tumor microenvironment (TME) fosters a context of molecular crosstalk that is hostile to inflammatory, anti-tumor immunological responses that present a significant roadblock to consistently successful immunotherapy. Aberrant IL-33 present in the TME is believed to be one of these major factors that drives tumor progression via its ligand, ST2, and the subsequent recruitment of IL1RAcP. This activates MyD88 cascades in dysfunctional myeloid immune cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), eliciting immunosuppression that promotes tumor tolerance and subsequent disease progression. To this end, preventing IL-33\/ST2 signaling activation is an attractive target to possibly manipulate immune cells to recognize and mount a response against tumor cells. Our previous work has identified 4 IL1RAcP hotspot residues of interaction between it and the ST2\/IL-33 complex: R157, K238, K343, and K346. Here, we designed peptides, which mimic these hotspots and the adjacent residues that interact with the ST2\/IL-33 complex. Wild type peptides inhibit trimer formation <i>in vitro<\/i> as determined by immunoprecipitation and chemical crosslinking experiments. Modifications introduced to increase rigidity and stability increased affinity <i>in vitro<\/i> and showed inhibition of downstream signaling in reporter gene cell models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1f2f5d98-5e12-4d94-88ec-20b38a23d172\/@x03B8ZPF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Tumor microenvironment,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Molecular targets,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17151"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jessica Roman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Carter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandra Luchini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lance Liotta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Remi Veneziano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Haymond<\/i><\/presenter>.

KRAS and c-MYC are important oncogenes in PDAC linked to tumor immune suppression. We describe the use of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and a c-RAF inhibitor (GW5074) to indirectly target c-MYC and KRAS, respectively. DFMO in combination with GW5074 was tested for ability to improve pancreatic cancer outcomes. Pancreatic cancer cells showed decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in response to a combination of DFMO + GW5074. <i>In vivo<\/i> orthotopic models of pancreatic tumors had decreased tumor weight in DFMO + GW5074 treated mice, when compared to control group. However, only treatment with single agent DFMO resulted in improved survival of immunocompetent pancreatic tumor bearing mice with respect to control, in contrast to treatment with GW5074 alone or DFMO + GW5074. To understand why the <i>in vivo<\/i> data was contrary to <i>in vitro <\/i>results, immunohistochemical analysis of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment was used to reveal increased expression of markers associated with anti-tumor effects such as CD86, CD3, CD4 and CD8 in DFMO treated tumors. Tumors treated with DFMO also displayed decreased expression of MYC, suggesting that DFMO-associated MYC suppression could be linked to decreased immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment and improved survival. In contrast, GW5074 treatment maintained MYC expression in tumors. Overall, the present study points to DFMO being an immunomodulatory agent, and a need for further understanding of DFMO-based therapeutic strategies in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b16c68f2-fc22-4063-976d-68986c6d7540\/@x03B8ZPF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,T lymphocytes,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17153"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sai Preethi Nakkina<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah B.

Because high tumor T cell infiltration corresponds with better clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients, immunotherapy has gained significant interest over the last decade for the treatment of recurrent pancreatic cancer. IL-12 is a proinflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic effects including activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Unfortunately, systemic high dose IL-12 administration led to severe toxicities in clinical trials which has limited further development of this cytokine as a cancer therapeutic. To address this limitation, we developed an implantable cytokine delivery platform to allow for local administration of IL-12. These cytokine factories, composed of genetically engineered epithelial cells encapsulated in biocompatible polymers, allow for safe and controlled dosing <i>in vivo<\/i>. Tumor adjacent administration of IL-12-based cytokine factories caused reduction of intraperitoneal pan02 tumor burden by 80% after only 1 week of treatment in mice with pancreatic cancer. Single cell RNAseq of the tumor adjacent immune cells at this time point showed 2x more T and NK cells present in the IL-12 treated mice than untreated mice suggesting modulation of the tumor microenvironment via immune cell infiltration. Importantly, the necessary IL-12 dose was well tolerated in all mice without signs of toxicity for 180 days. In efforts to evaluate the translatability of this platform, we further tested IL-12-based cytokine factories in a non-human primate. The cytokine factories produced a high local IL-12 concentration without substantial leakage into the systemic circulation and were well tolerated by the primates as shown by the lack of fever or weight loss, as well as the lack of renal or liver toxicity. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of IL-12 treatments when administered locally via cytokine factories in preclinical animal models. Further, these findings provide rationale for future development and clinical testing of cytokine factories for treatment of a wide range of metastatic peritoneal cancers in humans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/93fc229a-7431-45ce-abcf-5b8bc4648826\/@y03B8ZPG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Microenvironment,Immunotherapy,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17154"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda Nash<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samira Aghlara-Fotovat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bertha Castillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annie Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Cui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Hernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Rios<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofia Ghani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ira Joshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunyu Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Sheth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiyi Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Oberholzer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amir Jazaeri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omid Veiseh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Unfortunately, such treatments are not always successful. While tumor resistance to immunotherapy is often the reason, a subpopulation of patients treated with ICB show an acceleration in tumor growth rate, termed hyperprogressive disease (HPD) or hyperprogression (HP). Different studies have evaluated the incidence rate of HPD at 4% to 30%, though clear predictors have been elusive. An impediment to progress on investigating HPD has long been the lack of a reliable disease model. We recently reported a humanized mouse model of hyperprogression using mismatch repair deficient (MMR-d) p53-\/- HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice humanized with human CD8+ T-cell line TALL-104 and treated with anti-PD-1 Pembrolizumab. Flow cytometry was used to ensure the systemic establishment of the TALL-104 CD8+ human T-cells used to humanize the athymic mice and characterize immune tumor infiltration, which was not different between groups. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed increased expression of proliferation marker Ki67 within the HPD xenografts, supporting the finding that HPD tumors were exhibiting accelerated growth. Initial human cytokine analysis revealed a significant elevation in three cytokines (IFN-&#947;, TRAIL R2, and RANK L) and a significant decrease in four (CCL2, Chitinase 3-like 1, IL-4, and TNF-&#945;). We attempted to mitigate HP through administration of anti-EGFR Panitumumab based on some clinical studies linking EGFR aberration to HPD but found worsened HPD in cotreated mice. We are conducting RNA sequencing to identify any changes in the RNAome of the HPD model, and immunoperoxidase analysis of resected tumor tissue for cytokine expression and cell death markers that may provide clues for accelerated growth within the HPD tumor microenvironment. Future studies will also focus on the interplay between Pembrolizumab and Panitumumab observed preliminarily to exacerbate the HPD with more comprehensive <i>in vivo <\/i>studies including of patient-derived xenotransplants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1fc5568c-2249-44dc-981c-de703d74ccfb\/@y03B8ZPG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,Hyperprogressive Disease (HPD),Hyperprogression (HP),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17155"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew George<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilyas Sahin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shengliang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wafik S.
