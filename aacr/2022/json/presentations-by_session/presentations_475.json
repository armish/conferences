[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> EVT801 is a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of VEGFR3 and acts by inhibiting lymphangiogenesis and tumor angiogenesis in and around the tumor. It has shown compelling activity in a wide range of cancer models and is well-tolerated in preclinical toxicology studies. A phase I study is underway and will focus primarily on understanding the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of EVT801 across a range of doses.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The first stage of the study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for EVT801, with a second stage aiming to confirm RP2D in selected cancer patient populations. Clinical samples from these patients will be used to explore preliminary signals of clinical efficacy and investigate the biological activity of the drug using several biomarkers. Efficacy biomarkers will include imaging approaches (DCE-MRI and CEUS) to characterize tumor vascularization, as well as analysis of protein and mRNA quantification in on-treatment biopsies vs pre-treatment biopsies. Moreover, the relationship between activity of EVT801 and expression of key markers at protein and mRNA level will be investigated to potentially establish biomarkers for patient stratification and selection. Lastly, target engagement and pharmacodynamics effects will be investigated by immuno-monitoring as well as assessment of a defined set of proteins as markers of inflammation and angiogenesis as identified in preclinical <i>in vivo<\/i> models. We expect that these analyses will help to better understand the effects of the drug in human subjects and may also help to select the most responsive patients and provide early signs of clinical efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09ab555c-5ddf-45e0-90bf-004dcecd124e\/@v03B8ZNp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,Angiogenesis inhibitor,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11906"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Michael R.

Toxic chemicals present in TS induce DNA damage leading to carcinogenic mutations. Moreover, TS can also cause epigenetic and gene expression changes in tumor and other cells of the tumor microenvironment, especially through its addictive component nicotine. We and others have reported that nicotine promotes tumor angiogenesis via its direct impact on the endothelial cells or by altering the cancer cell secretome. In this study, we wanted to explore the association of smoking habits with the differential expression of angiogenesis-related genes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified a set of 48 angiogenesis-related genes that were surveyed for differential expression in smoker versus non-smoker patients in The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) database using an interactive web application, UALCAN. Gender and age of the LUAD patients were considered as confounding variables since patients of different age groups and gender can have biological and physiological differences, which could influence gene expression regardless of the smoking habits. We identified a total of fourteen differentially-expressed genes, of which four (<i>HTATIP2, NCL, SPHK1<\/i>, and <i>VEGFA<\/i>) were overexpressed and ten (<i>AGGF1, AMOT, C1GALT1, ERAP1, NPR1, PML, RNH1, SHH, SPINL5, <\/i>and<i> TNFSF12<\/i>) were downregulated in LUAD of smokers than those of non-smokers. Five of the differentially-expressed genes (<i>HTATIP2, NCL NPR1, PML,<\/i> and <i>TNFSF12<\/i>) exhibited significantly different transcript levels in males versus females and three (<i>SPHK1, AGGF1<\/i>, and <i>SPINK5<\/i>) showed varying pattern of expression in LUAD of different age group patients. Literature survey found prior published evidence for an association of two of the fourteen differentially expressed genes (<i>NCL<\/i> and <i>NPR<\/i>) with nicotine exposure. Together, our findings identify smoking-associated angiogenic gene signatures that could be potential effectors of nicotine signaling that promotes cancer angiogenesis and should be validated further by conducting laboratory investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/055a7262-d22e-4247-a985-b47b93e744a1\/@v03B8ZNp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,Lung adenocarcinoma,Smoking,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11908"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shubhangi Singh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santanu Dasgupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elba A.

The manipulation of cytosolic nucleic acid sensors has become a strategy to boost the immune response in cancer therapy, but it is critical to understand how these nucleic acid sensors work in the tumor microenvironment. One aspect of the immune microenvironment is the nucleic acid sensor, which recognizes pathogenic nucleic acids and activates an immune response. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is an RNA sensor that responds to dsRNA by activating a type I interferon response. It has been found that RIG-I activation can induce an anti-tumor immune response, but its role in the tumor microenvironment is unknown. Prior studies show regulation of the innate immune response in endothelium can increase the anti-tumor response.<b> <\/b>Understanding the role of RIG-I in endothelial cells, and how this can be used to potentially reprogram the tumor microenvironment, is critical for developing more effective cancer treatments. In addition, my research on the effects of RIG-I in endothelium has wide-reaching implications beyond cancer treatment. I hypothesize RIG-I activation in endothelial cells will produce an anti-tumor immune response. My findings show that endothelial RIG-I activates a robust type I interferon response and inhibits EC function including, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting migration, which is indicative that RIG-I plays a role in the endothelial immune response. RIG-I also plays a role in the expression of the several angiogenic regulators in a tissue-specific manner. This research will provide critical knowledge about the role of RIG-I in tumor angiogenesis, and provide novel treatment avenues for solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e995b49a-a3dc-4810-a9ef-241bf04eaf43\/@v03B8ZNp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-03 Molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endothelial cells,Angiogenesis,RNA,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11907"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adrian M.

The presence of malignant ascites is a critical prognostic sign of tumor progression. With an understanding of these patient subsets, better optimized treatment strategies are needed.<br \/>Method: We analyzed whole exome and transcriptome sequences of ascites or primary tumor samples obtained from 46 patients with advanced gastric cancer. In addition, we engineered a microfluidic-based gastric cancer patient-on-a-chip (GRASP) to develop a tumor-induced patient-specific angiogenesis model and evaluate the ramucirumab responses.<br \/>Results: Through single-cell sequencing, 46 patients were classified into two groups according to the level of KDR gene (VEGFR2) expression. (high KDR, N=25; low KDR, N=21) In the group with high VEGFR2 expression, 68% (17 of 25) samples were from ascites, and all samples with low KDR were from primary tumors. In the GRASP system, the quantitative results of random co-culture of PDCs from 46 patients with blood vessels demonstrated high concordances to the sequence results. In addition, the angiogenesis inhibitory effect of Ramucirumab was also high in the KDR high group.<br \/>Conclusion: Understanding angiogenesis inhibition as part of a therapeutic strategy considering tumor microenvironment has important clinical implications.

Notch activation is associated with poor outcomes in several cancers, particularly triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and affects both tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. The development of therapeutics targeting angiogenesis, such as the Notch pathway, has again attracted attention. Previous approaches to globally inhibit the Notch pathway or block Dll4\/Notch1 activation, such as &#947;-secretase inhibitors (GSI), have raised safety concerns due to gastrointestinal toxicity due to accumulation of secretory goblet cells in the intestine. Similarly, anti-Dll4 therapy resulted in pathological changes in the liver as well as severe vascular neoplasms when evaluated using preclinical animal models. Development of new approaches for targeting the Notch pathway remains a critical clinical problem currently unaddressed. Our lab has previously developed ligand-specific inhibitors of Notch signaling, called Notch decoys, which are comprised of Fc fusions to specific EGF-like repeats of the Notch1 extracellular domain. These Notch decoys bind ligand non-productively and interfere with ligand function. Jagged-specific Notch1 decoys inhibit angiogenesis <i>in vitro <\/i>and significantly impair tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis, and perfusion without apparent toxicity in mouse models of TNBC. However, this previous work utilized Notch decoys produced via viral expression vectors, which preclude dosage control and limit clinical applicability. We have developed a new generation of Notch &#8220;mini&#8221; decoys that contain fewer EGF-like repeats. These mini decoys show improved secretion characteristics and can be purified as active proteins in clinically relevant quantities. Using a variety of binding assays, we observed that these Notch mini decoys demonstrate strong but distinct binding to Notch ligands Dll4 and Jagged1 and block Notch signaling when evaluated in cultured cells. Our newly generated Notch decoys can now be sufficiently purified for use in a dose-dependent manner to test the therapeutic role of Notch inhibition on tumor angiogenesis using preclinical animal models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13b97e46-8e94-4903-8222-1332e7e785d2\/@v03B8ZNp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Notch-1,Antiangiogenic therapy,Angiogenesis inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11912"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy Sargis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seock-Won Youn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>L.A.

As originally envisioned, angiogenesis inhibition would cut off the blood supply, deprive tumor cells of key nutrients, leading to their demise. In practice, while there is evidence that tumors under angiogenesis treatment do in fact exhibit some degree of metabolic stress, this is stress is not sufficient to induce significant cancer cell death. We posit that the full potential of angiogenesis inhibition can be realized by the combination of angiogenesis inhibition with emerging tumor metabolism targeting therapies. Because tumors under angiogenesis inhibition are already in a state of nutrient stress, the effects of metabolically targeted therapies such as amino acid depletion (e.g. asparginase, methionine restriction), inhibitors of stress adaption (AMPK and GCN2 inhibitors) or energy metabolism (e.g. IACS-010759, Metformin, POMHEX) stand to dramatically increase in potency whilst remaining selective for (angiogenic) tumor versus (non-angiogenic) normal tissue. Here, we provide proof-of-principal for this thesis. First, we performed metabolomic profiling of angiogenesis-inhibited tumors, which corroborates a state of nutrient stress in angiogenesis-inhibited tumors. Second, we demonstrate dramatic anti-neoplastic synergy (effectively curing of xenografted tumor-bearing mice, irrespective of initial tumor size), without enhanced adverse toxicities, between the anti-VEGFA antibody Avastin and enolase inhibitor HEX. The same results were recapitulated with the VEGFR inhibitor Tivozanib and HEX and the enolase inhibitor could be substituted with the Oxphos inhibitor IACS-010759, with similar effects. The synergy was observed in a broad range of tumor types, even those without clear genetic susceptibilities. Together, these results suggest that angiogenesis inhibitors synergize broadly with cancer therapies targeting metabolism, allowing the realization of the full potential of these previously disappointing drugs. Our results warrant systematic combination clinical trials between angiogenesis inhibitors and established, as well as emerging anti-metabolic cancer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e00f7e4-a5fd-4a3b-a7d4-343c28b1bfa0\/@v03B8ZNp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis inhibitor,Metabolism,Brain tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11913"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sunada Khadka<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Hsi Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffery Ackroyd<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenisha Arthur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasaman Barekatain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anton Poral<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theresa Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eliot Behr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yining Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dimitra Georgiou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald Depinho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Muller<\/i><\/presenter>.

HPV-negative HNSCC harboring p53 mutations have the worst clinical outcomes with 50-60% local regional and distant recurrences causing increased morbidity and mortality. <i>TP53<\/i> mutations are associated with shorter recurrence-free and overall survival. Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis play a causal role in tumor recurrence and lymph node metastasis. Therefore, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis is important in to preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis of <i>TP53<\/i> mutant HNSCC. Previous studies demonstrated that mTOR activates STAT3 to upregulate HIF-1&#945; and its target proteins, VEGF-A and VEGF-C, key molecules involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, respectively. Further, mTOR inhibitors suppress autocrine and paracrine growth stimulation of tumor and lymphatic endothelial cells by impairing the VEGF-C\/VEGF-3 axis and releasing soluble VEGFR-2. Accordingly, our objective was to investigate the effect of an mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, on angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis of HPV-negative <i>TP53<\/i> mutant HNSCC. Everolimus treatment of HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines harboring a variety of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations ,significantly downregulated protein and mRNA levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-C. Moreover, everolimus downregulated HIF-1&#945; protein levels suggesting a HIF-1alpha-dependent VEGF modulation. Interestingly, treatment of human microvascular and lymphatic endothelial cells (HMEC-1 and HMEC-1A, respectively) with everolimus was also associated with a significant reduction in cell proliferation, <i>in vitro<\/i> tube formation, and migration. Protein and mRNA levels of HIF-1&#945;, VEGF-A, and VEGF-C were downregulated by everolimus treatment in both HMEC-1 and HMEC-1A cell lines. Taken together, our data suggest that everolimus prevents angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis through the inhibition of HIF-1&#945;, indicating a promising role for mTOR inhibitors in treating HPV-negative <i>TP53<\/i> mutant HNSCC patients at high risk for recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/94625c19-169c-4656-bde3-a619b028a219\/@n03B8ZNq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,mTOR,p53 mutations,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11914"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Md Maksudul Alam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janmaris Marin Fermin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Knackstedt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mackenzie J.

Cachexia affects 85% of pancreatic cancer patients and patients suffer the greatest average weight loss among solid cancers. Inflammation is a key driver in cancer cachexia, specifically the Interleukin-6\/GP130 family of cytokines that activate signaling of the JAK\/STAT pathway. Among family members, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) promote cachexia and pancreatic cancer; however, less is known of the related Oncostatin M. Here we show cachexia and elevated circulating Osm coincide in the Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup>;Pdx1:Cre genetically engineered mouse model (KPC-GEMM) of pancreatic cancer and in mice bearing KPC cells implanted orthotopically. <i>Osm<\/i> expression was elevated in cardiac muscle and adipose tissue in KPC cachexia, while OSM receptor (<i>Osmr<\/i>) was elevated in cardiac and skeletal muscle and liver, indicating a systemic OSM circuit. Consistent with a feed-forward loop, KPC cells treated with OSM upregulated expression of OSMR. RNA-sequencing of OSM treated KPC and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) cell lines revealed activation of inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor progression pathways, including induction of IL-6. Functionally, exogenous OSM caused cardiac dysfunction, local muscle atrophy, fibrosis, and systemic bone loss in wildtype and <i>Il6 <\/i>null mice, suggesting OSM might mediate cachexia independent of IL-6. We hypothesized that deletion of OSM would be protective in cancer cachexia. Thus 14-week-old WT and <i>Osm<sup> <\/sup><\/i> null mice were orthotopically implanted with KPC cells or underwent sham surgery; all groups were euthanized when one reached 5% fat mass. KPC tumors caused muscle weakness, body deconditioning and reduced activity as well as anemia and hematological inflammation. These findings were not genotype specific. There were also no differences in KPC-induced cardiac, skeletal muscle or fat wasting, nor in splenomegaly, organ wasting, or tumor size between WT and <i>Osm <\/i>null mice. Similarly, <i>Osmr<\/i> null mice showed no differences in KPC cachexia phenotypes versus wildtype mice. Nevertheless, tumors from <i>Osm <\/i>null mice showed alterations in the stromal compartment, including reduction in collagens I and III, decreased alpha smooth muscle actin staining, and altered mitochondrial metabolism and cellular composition by proteomics and RNAseq. Consistent with a role for OSM in modulating the stroma, excess OSM induced compaction of tumor cells and CAFs in 3D co-cultures. Together these data indicate that OSM signaling influences tumor-fibroblast crosstalk in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment but is not necessary for cachexia in the macroenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/15bc31bb-9fdd-4432-8bad-cf6fd17ff08a\/@n03B8ZNq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-02 Host-tumor interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,Pancreatic Cancer,Cytokines,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17228"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daenique H.
