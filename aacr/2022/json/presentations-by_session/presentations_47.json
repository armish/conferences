IDO is canonically characterized as a metabolic enzyme that&#8217;s responsible for the rate-limiting conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine. The depletion of tryptophan and\/or the accumulation of kynurenine has been the long-standing dogma attributed to how IDO suppresses the anti-cancer immune response for &#62;20 years. We recently revised this hypothesis by showing that tumor cell IDO enhances <u>intra<\/u>tumoral immunosuppressive Treg and myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation and decreases the survival of mice with GBM that is independent of tryptophan metabolism [Zhai&#8943;<b>Wainwright<\/b>, 2021; Clinical Cancer Research, 27(23):6514-6528].Utilizing young mouse models with intracranial brain tumors, it was demonstrated that combining the IDO pathway inhibitor, dextrorotatory 1-methyl tryptophan (<i>D<\/i>1-MT) with anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs, facilitates a synergistic survival benefit and long-term durable antitumor effect that&#8217;s protective against GBM re-challenge events [<b>Wainwright<\/b> et al., 2014; Clinical Cancer Research, 20(20):5290-301]. It&#8217;s interesting that IDO non-enzyme (ie. <i>D<\/i>1-MT) and IDO enzyme inhibitors (ie. epacadostat, BMS-986205, etc.) both demonstrate therapeutic activity in young mouse models of cancer [Zhai&#8943;<b>Wainwright<\/b>, 2015; Clinical Cancer Research, 21(24):5427-33]. We have also confirmed that increased <u>intra<\/u>tumoral IDO expression is inversely associated with GBM patient survival and that human infiltrating T cells increase IDO expression in GBM and contribute to decreased patient survival [Zhai&#8943;<b>Wainwright<\/b>, 2017; Clinical Cancer Research, 23(21):6650-6660]. We further discovered that, although tumor cell IDO regulates <u>intra<\/u>tumoral Treg and MDSC levels, the therapeutic effects of pharmacologic IDO enzyme inhibitors are primarily mediated by actions that inhibit IDO enzyme activity by non-tumor cells [Ladomersky&#8943;<b>Wainwright<\/b>, 2018; Clinical Cancer Research, 24(11):2559-73]. This preclinical investigation led to the opening of a phase I clinical trial at our medical center that&#8217;s combining stereotactic radiation (RT), nivolumab (anti-PD-1 mAb), and BMS-986205 (IDO enzyme inhibitor) treatment in newly-diagnosed human patients with wild-type IDH (wtIDH) GBM [NCT04047706]. Since the median age of human adults with wtIDH GBM is 68-70 years old and coincides with an age at which many neurodegenerative diseases significantly increase in the brain including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and stroke [Kim&#8943;<b>Wainwright<\/b>, 2021; Neuro-Oncology Advances, 3(1):vdab125], we next questioned whether subject age plays a role in determining the effectiveness of immunotherapy for younger versus older patients with GBM. We discovered that older human adults with GBM die significantly faster than younger adults with GBM despite the treatment with immune checkpoint blockade approaches including anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and\/or anti-CTLA-4 mAbs [Ladomersky&#8943;<b>Wainwright<\/b>, 2020; Clinical Cancer Research, 26(19):5232-45]. Intriguingly, IDO expression increases in the older adult brain and its <u>extra<\/u>tumoral (ie. outside of the tumor and inside of the normal brain parenchyma) expression suppresses RT + anti-PD-1 mAb + IDO enzyme inhibitor treatment efficacy in older adults with GBM as compared to younger counterparts with GBM [Ladomersky&#8943;<b>Wainwright<\/b>, 2020; Clinical Cancer Research, 26(19):5232-45]. Since older adults comprise the largest population of patients with cancer, and because the relationship between subject age and increased IDO levels has never been studied, this result is in-line with potentially contributing to the explanation of why IDO enzyme inhibition has failed to improve the overall survival of human GBM patients to-date. In addition to providing insights from these previous observations, this presentation will highlight our group&#8217;s current objectives to: (i) develop IDO-PROTACs that aim to therapeutically degrade IDO protein rather than only inhibiting IDO enzyme activity, (ii) define how IDO suppresses the anti-cancer immune response independent of its normal association with tryptophan metabolism, (iii) discuss targeting IDO as a maladaptive aging factor, and (iv) discuss the ongoing clinical trial results of GBM patients treated with RT, anti-PD-1 mAb, and IDO enzyme inhibitor at our medical center.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL03-01 Aging, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IDO,Senescence,Aging,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Derek A.
