[{"Abstract":"Genomic profiling of tumors has uncovered staggering amounts of novel alterations, termed variants of uncertain significance (VUS), even in well-studied oncogenes. Strikingly, as the number of sequenced samples increases so does the number of VUS. While the study of alterations identified as VUS has shown that some are inconsequential, it has also been shown that many can cause protein activation and are involved in oncogenicity and resistance to therapy or might serve as novel drug targets. We developed a high-throughput cell-based assay that allows functional annotation of VUS and their sensitivity to different inhibitors. The system quantifies signaling pathway activation using fluorescent imaging coupled with image analysis of cells expressing the mutated protein together with a fluorescently labeled signaling pathway reporter. We show that this method accurately identifies known driver mutations in 10 different oncogenes, including receptor tyrosine kinases and signaling proteins, spanning the four major signaling pathways involved in cancer. We then deployed this system to characterize over 100 different VUS in these genes. We also show that the method correctly recapitulates differential sensitivity of cKIT and EGFR mutations to different inhibitors. Finally, we highlight the importance of concurrent mutations in KRAS which abrogate the response to EGFR inhibitors. Altogether, this system provides significant information both for development of new targeted agents as well as tailoring of optimal treatment for patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/34a1ce8a-d3b5-4d34-9079-67e7d26fbd07\/@x03B8ZHj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell signaling,High-throughput assay,Oncogene,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16376"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zohar Barbash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>DIkla Haham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Fillipov-Levy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Limor Cohen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lea Birnbaum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shay Rotkopf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilona Kifer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gabi Tarcic<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, these advanced techniques can be confounded by variability of sample collection, storage, or profiling protocols, making it difficult to accurately compare data generated by different laboratories. Further, as more spatial profiling datasets become publicly available, having methods to enable meta-analysis of samples collected on different studies will maximize the learnings to support the advancement of treatments or identifying patient segments.<br \/>To quantify the variability of spatial profiling data at different laboratories and to advance data normalization methodologies, 4 independent laboratories used the NanoString&#174;&nbsp;GeoMx&#174;&nbsp;Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) to profile serial 5 &#181;m sections of tissue and cell pellet arrays (CPAs). GeoMx DSP enables high throughput, spatially resolved analysis of gene or protein expression from fresh or archival human tissues. In this study, the GeoMx Cancer Transcriptome Atlas was used to profile &#62;1800 genes simultaneously. We examined the concordance of GeoMx data generated in the different laboratories when controlling for methodical variation (e.g., reagents, tissue source) and experimentally varying region of interest (ROI) size, collection site, and sample preservation methods.<br \/>Sections of tonsil, colon, and 2 CPAs were profiled separately at the 4 laboratories.&nbsp;Each analyzed fresh cut (FC) tissues and two sites examined sample stability by analyzing the impact of storing slides at -80&#176;C for 1 month prior to spatial profiling. Concordance analysis was performed using the Horn-Morisita Index on raw data comparing paired and unpaired ROIs across each set of slides.<br \/>In CPA samples where each pellet was a different tumor type (e.g., NSCLC, melanoma), we observed strong clustering by cell line. While data initially showed varying degrees of clustering by slide, factoring out this variable removed the association of slide, allowing integration of the data across profiling locations without affecting concordance within slides. In tonsil, ROIs with increasing area were profiled. Comparing expression between pairs of samples for a given area, concordance increased with ROI size (R = -0.40, p&#60;6e-06). Finally, we observed little impact of preservation method (FC vs -80&#176;C) in these data.<br \/>In this study, we quantify slide-specific variation observed in high-plex RNA profiling by the DSP platform and detail methods for accounting for this variation. We note that many downstream analyses (e.g., differential expression) already model slide effects during the analysis, but modeling it explicitly allows for direct comparison of concordance with other approaches (e.g., clustering, PCA). These methods support the use of multi-institution studies leveraging the GeoMx platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/66ce6b1b-88de-438e-9af2-a63978a1ee2b\/@x03B8ZHj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Profiling,FFPE,Cancer therapy,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16377"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"2005b827-f6e5-4da4-bc69-d3c586b63498","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2005b827-f6e5-4da4-bc69-d3c586b63498\/@x03B8ZHj\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tyler Hether<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Howes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Scoville<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlie Glaser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanyun Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rami Vanguri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neeman Mohibullah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wan-Jung Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todd Yoder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minnal Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathy Ton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zach Herbert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Reeves<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Mittendorf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Lacey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Travis Hollmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Warren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theresa LaVallee<\/i><\/presenter>.

Ectopic mammary tissue may occur anywhere along the milk line, from the axilla to the groin. Thus, breast cancer present in the vulva may arise as a primary breast adenocarcinoma or distant metastasis. Differentiating the two can be clinically challenging but is critically important as it impacts prognosis and treatment. Using genomic and bioinformatic approaches, we re-evaluated a previously histopathologically diagnosed rare case of metachronous vulvar ectopic breast cancer.<br \/>Methods: Two biobanked breast tumor samples were obtained from a 43-year-old woman diagnosed with <i>in situ<\/i> breast cancer 17 months prior to her presentation and diagnosis with vulvar ectopic breast carcinoma. Whole exome (WES) and whole transcriptomic sequencing (RNAseq) were performed on all breast and vulvar tumor samples. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using the QIAGEN software suite (CLC Genomic Workbench, QCI-T) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Sequence variants with &#62;10 reads and 5% AF were selected for analysis.<br \/>Results: We performed detailed molecular characterization of breast and vulvar tumor samples. WES profiles revealed, respectively, 4904 and 166 somatic mutations from primary breast and vulva tumor tissues. Among these mutations, 60 mutations were shared between primary breast and vulva tumors. Given the length of the WES target (~54MB). We calculated the probability that the shared mutations could occur by chance alone. To estimate this likelihood, we made the assumption that all positions interrogated by WES could be mutated with equal probability. Under this assumption, it is highly unlikely that the 60 identical mutations identified in multiple samples would occur by chance alone (<i>Fisher exact test - p &#60;10<sup>100<\/sup>)<\/i> Beyond these shared mutations, we identified a number of known breast cancer functional variants including variants in <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>KMT2D<\/i>, <i>MET<\/i> and an additional 32 likely pathogenic genes in the vulvar tumor that were not shared with the patient&#8217;s original breast tumor tissues. Similarly, we also identified a pathogenic variant in <i>PRKAR1A<\/i> and an additional 95 likely pathogenic variants in genes including <i>ATRX, ATXN3, CTBP2<\/i>, <i>SCN2A<\/i> only in the breast tumor.<br \/>Conclusion: This illustrative case provides an interesting resolution to a clinically difficult question: differentiating synchronous or metachronous breast carcinoma in the vulva.

In order to extend the eligibility of target therapeutics, transcriptome profiles of patients have been examined to better delineate sensitivity of target therapeutics. In this study, we took advantage of multiple large datasets such as cancer cell line transcriptome data (CCLE), drug response data (CTRP), and gene dependency data (Achilles Project) to determine the sensitivity markers of tyrosine kinase inhibitors currently approved by FDA. In particular, EGFR inhibitors (iEGFR: lapatinib, gefitinib and erlotinib) revealed clear sensitivity cluster of cell line regardless of EGFR mutation status. Comparative analysis between sensitive (iEGFR-S) and resistant (iEGFR-R) cell groups revealed that integrated gene signatures such as chemokine, GPCR, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, were predicted as putative determinants of iEGFR susceptibility. Through integrated analysis of gene dependency data, among several Achilles&#8217; targets (of which depletion increases vulnerability), predicted in iEGFR-R cells group, druggable Achilles&#8217; targets (available to accompanied drugs) such as CCR6, AURKA and mTOR were identified as putative targets for sensitizing iEGFR-R group to iEGFR. Following biochemical studies validated the clear sensitizing effect of the pharmacological inhibitor for each predicted target, in the isogenic cell models with acquired iEGFR resistance. In addition, prediction and following biochemical validation, we demonstrated that the CCR6 inhibition significantly attenuated resistance of iEGFR by repressing mitochondrial ROS (mt-ROS), of which induction by iEGFR rescued cell death. These data suggest that integrated-omics analysis would be a useful approach to extend eligibility and improve the efficacy of target therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd03d073-a603-4358-a9e8-25d3f9351bea\/@x03B8ZHj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,EGFR,Targeted therapy,Intergrated-omics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16383"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eun-Ji Kwon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haeseung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyuk-Jin Cha<\/i><\/presenter>.

To facilitate globally available CGP solutions, we have developed and validated the PGDx elio plasma complete cell-free DNA (cfDNA) kitted assay, which employs a hybrid capture-based 521-gene, 2.1 Mb targeted panel, combined with automated bioinformatics and reporting. PGDx elio plasma complete detects single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (indels), amplifications, translocations, microsatellite instability (MSI), blood tumor mutation burden (bTMB), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Targets include clinically relevant alterations, such as those contained within ALK, BRAF, BRCA1\/2, EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR1\/2\/3, KIT, KRAS, MET, NRAS, NTRK1\/2\/3, PIK3CA, RET, and ROS1. With as little as 10 ng of sample input of cfDNA, and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000, PGDx elio plasma complete achieves deep coverage across the target region combined with automated bioinformatics and reporting algorithms. We assessed the analytical performance of this assay. Analytical specificity in a cohort of 20 non-cancerous donors was 100% for all clinically actionable variants and 99.9% panel-wide. The reportable range of the assay is &#8805; 0.10% variant allele frequency (VAF) for SNVs and indels, &#8805; 3 fusion reads for translocations, and &#8805; 1.15-fold for amplifications. Furthermore, analytical sensitivity studies using dilution series with known positive alterations demonstrated a limit of detection ranging from 0.32-0.78% VAF for actionable mutations, 0.34-1.75% VAF for panel-wide mutations, 0.33% VAF for translocations, and 1.32-fold for amplifications. The assay produces highly reproducible results, with 100% average positive agreement (APA) for clinically actionable alterations and 92.5% APA for panel-wide alterations across operators, days, and runs. Compared to a CGP assay of a similar size, PGDx elio plasma complete achieved a 94.7% positive predictive value and &#62;99.9% negative predictive value across all variant types assessed. The PGDx elio plasma complete assay can be processed manually or through automated liquid handling systems with high concordance, with an overall success rate of 97.8%. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the PGDx elio plasma complete assay is a sensitive, specific, accurate, reproducible, and robust approach to enable CGP to guide both translational biomarker discovery and CGP-informed precision oncology strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/27e47e32-ef4d-4b2d-8d77-febe9a2f2657\/@x03B8ZHj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Precision medicine,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Pan-Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16384"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kenneth C.

However, druggable oncogenes do not occur in most cancers. Systematic identification of signaling pathways required for the fitness of cancer cells will facilitate the development of new cancer therapies. We used gene essentiality measurements in 793 cancer cell lines to identify selective co-essentiality modules and found that a ubiquitination ligase complex composed of <i>UBA6<\/i>, <i>BIRC6<\/i>, <i>KCMF1<\/i> and <i>UBR4,<\/i> which encode an E1, E2 and two heterodimeric E3 subunits, respectively, is required for the survival of a subset of epithelial tumors. Suppressing BIRC6 in cell lines that are dependent on this complex led to a substantial reduction in cell fitness <i>in vitro <\/i>and potent tumor regression <i>in vivo<\/i>. Mechanistically, BIRC6 suppression resulted in selective activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) by stabilization and upregulation of the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), a direct ubiquitination target of the UBA6\/BIRC6\/KCMF1\/UBR4 complex. These observations uncover a novel ubiquitination cascade that regulates ISR and highlight the potential of ISR activation as a new therapeutic strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ef24499-8b13-4f3d-bdda-79adeaba06be\/@x03B8ZHj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Ubiquitination,Stress response,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16385"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lisa D.

To acclimate to this deprived microenvironment, cancer cells upregulate hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1) signaling pathway priming themselves towards more aggressive and heterogeneous phenotypes. Hence, tumor hypoxia becomes a major obstacle for effective cancer treatment. Deciphering hypoxia-driven tumor heterogeneity within the tumors is essential to understanding cancer biology and developing novel therapeutic strategies. A stronger focus should be directed towards the effect of hypoxia types and levels rather than just the absence or presence of hypoxia since hypoxia is heterogeneous in the three-dimensional (3D) tumor microenvironment (TME). There are acute and chronic types of tumor hypoxia, and the hypoxia levels are also variable, forming unpredictable and irregular 3D hypoxic areas. Although traditional techniques (i.e., single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF)) and innovative spatial transcriptomics have been developed and applied for investigating tumor cell heterogeneity. Underlying issue of missing spatial information, limited numbers of the biomarker detection, underrepresentation of 3D tumor structure, or limited analyzed area onto the array chip size exist respectively in these methods.<br \/>The objective of this project is to develop a 3D spatial genomics approach with single-cell resolution, named sc3DSG, as an advanced spatial transcriptomic method to study hypoxia-driven cancer cell heterogeneity in 3D. Given that, I developed a 3D cellular fluorescence barcoding method by microscopic photobleaching in tumor macro-sections. The barcodes would maintain a fluorescent footprint of cells in different hypoxic areas upon tissue dissociation. Cells encoded with varied barcodes could be differentiated on flow cytometry and further sorted into separate groups for scRNA-seq. With the optimization with RNA preservation reagent in the workflow, sc3DSG achieves high-quality and high-yield RNA transcript for unbiased transcriptomic analysis. In summary, sc3DSG is an advanced spatial transcriptomic method including a sequential workflow of photobleaching barcoding, tissue dissociation, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and scRNA-seq. Sc3DSG enables the study of tissue molecular&nbsp;features&nbsp;without losing spatial information and is a better fit for the study of complex 3D structure like vessels or tumor hypoxia. This approach will unravel hypoxia-driven bimolecular and cellular features by considering the degrees and types of tumor hypoxia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/baed0e6d-cdde-4cf9-ba59-fbc4a0356417\/@y03B8ZHk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Spatial transcriptomics ,Photobleaching,Single-cell RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16387"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yi-Chien Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steve Seung-Young Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

Digital PCR emerged as a powerful technology for the next-generation analysis of liquid biopsies. Stilla Technologies' 6-color naica&#174; system is an ultrasensitive, easy-to-use digital PCR platform capable of simultaneously and precisely quantifying high numbers of biomarkers in a single reaction.<br \/>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR<\/i>) is frequently mutated in NSCLC. A handful of anti-<i>EGFR<\/i> Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor therapies are approved by the FDA; however, most patients develop resistance over time to these treatments. Both monitoring primary <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations to predict treatment response and precociously detecting resistance mutations to adapt treatments promptly through ctDNA analysis stand to improve the effectiveness of NSCLC patient management.<br \/>Stilla has developed a highly multiplexed 6-color Crystal Digital PCR <i>EGFR<\/i> kit detecting more than 90% of <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations described in NSCLC from ctDNA. The assay detects 32 common and rare somatic <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21, including both activating and resistant mutations.<br \/>In this work, we evaluated the sensitivity, precision and specificity of the <i>EGFR<\/i> 6-color Crystal Digital PCR assay highly specific and sensitive for the detection of <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations, with a Limit of Detection in a high background of wild-type DNA ranging from 0.30 to 0.46 cp\/&#956;L (with observed MAFs ranging from 0.06 to 0.09%). Moreover, a high concordance was observed between those <i>EGFR<\/i> results obtained for NSCLC ctDNA samples using 6-color Crystal Digital PCR and other technologies. With a rapid time to results and straightforward ctDNA analysis workflow, Crystal Digital PCR on the naica system promises ultrasensitive, highly multiplexed 6-color mutation detection, maximizing the information obtained from precious samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/37c6af4c-01f4-4afe-a792-0a86eb5237cf\/@y03B8ZHk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Droplet digital PCR,Cancer genomics,Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16388"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cécile Jovelet<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myrtille Remy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noémie Pata-Merci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Damien Vasseur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludovic Lacroix<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Labrador-Rached<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison C.

Advances in sequencing techniques and bioinformatic data processing enabled identification of wide spectrum of molecular alterations including single nucleotide variants, copy number aberrations, fusion genes or changes in expression and methylation patterns, which could serve as therapeutic targets. Translation of comprehensive molecular profiling into clinical practice is still limited, however, multiple precision oncology initiatives have already explored feasibility of this approach.<br \/>From September 2016 to December 2020, a total of 160 patients with high-risk solid tumors that were treated or consulted at Department of Pediatric Oncology of University Hospital Brno were subjected to molecular analysis of tumor tissue using whole-exome sequencing, targeted RNA sequencing, whole-transcriptome profiling and array-CGH. In 18 patients, 2 or more biopsies were analyzed due to relapse or progression of the disease. In the cohort, CNS tumors were the most prevalent (41%), followed by sarcomas (33%) and neuroblastoma (9%). All patients were presented at multidisciplinary molecular tumor board, where treatment recommendations were discussed.<br \/>In 37% of patients (n = 59), therapeutic targets were identified. Most commonly identified targets included <i>BRAF<\/i> (n = 9), <i>FGFR1<\/i> (n = 7), <i>NF1<\/i> (n = 6), <i>NRAS<\/i> (n = 5) and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (n = 4), making RAS\/MAPK signaling most frequently altered pathway in the subgroup. Single nucleotide variants or small indels accounted for 65% of actionable findings, followed by fusion genes (12%), copy number aberrations (9%), <i>CD274<\/i> expression (7%, confirmed by IHC staining for PD-L1 protein), and high tumor mutational burden (7%). Clinically relevant fusions were found in 25% of patients and 20% of identified fusions were targetable. 8 patients were eligible for immunotherapy based on either PD-L1 expression, or high tumor mutational burden (&#62;10 mut\/Mb).<br \/>Using molecular-based approach in treating high-risk patients represents a promising strategy and helps to understand the complexity of pediatric malignancies though examining tumor biology at multiple levels. Implementing the concept of precision oncology into clinical practice could not only be beneficial in the context of chances for improved survival of high-risk patients, but might also be convenient for other patients, whose successful treatment comes at cost of various secondary complications due to intensive chemotherapy\/radiotherapy approaches.<br \/><i>Supported by Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic, grant nr.

Here we employed the Oncomine Precision Assay (OPA) for sequencing of 998 clinical research FFPE (Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded) lung samples using the Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> integrated sequencing platform. The RNA assay strategy is aimed at providing a wide scope for studying known oncogenic fusions and exon skip variants, as well as a method for detection of novel fusion combinations and detection of fusions in a partner agnostic manner. We summarize the findings that include detected samples with oncogenic fusions in tyrosine kinase genes <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>RET<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i> as well as <i>MET<\/i> exon14 skipping, and demonstrate the novel fusion detection capabilities of the panel.<br \/>Methods: The Oncomine Precision Assay panel developed using the Ion AmpliSeq HD technology for use on both tissue and liquid biopsy samples to detect fusions with high sensitivity in low input RNA. The panel features 981 known fusion isoforms in 16 oncogenic drivers as well as assays for exon skipping and deletion in <i>MET<\/i> and <i>EGFR.<\/i> The amplicons are strategically designed around known fusion breakpoints and generate reads only if the variant is present. Results are assessed bioinformatically with a framework that includes detailed genomic annotations of the fusion breakpoint, and generates interpretable fusion calls and report in the Genxus<sup>TM<\/sup> software. In addition, the panel contains an algorithm for novel fusion detection, and 78 exon-junction amplicons for partner agnostic fusion detection in <i>ALK, RET, NTRK1,2,3<\/i> and <i>FGFR1,2,3<\/i> with an exon tiling expression imbalance assay. We used the Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> instrument to sequence 998 unique lung FFPE samples and analyzed the results with the Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> fusion analysis workflow.<br \/>Results: A total of 998 unique lung FFPEs were sequenced, of which 906 (91%) resulted with &#62;5000 aligned reads and at least 5 of the 7 RNA expression controls at the assay threshold. A total of 25 samples with <i>ALK<\/i> fusions were detected by either the targeted fusions or the expression imbalance assays. In addition, we detected 10 samples with <i>RET<\/i> fusions, 4 with <i>FGFR3<\/i> fusions, 3 with <i>ROS1<\/i> fusions, and additional single observations of <i>NRG1<\/i>, <i>RSPO3<\/i> and <i>FGFR1<\/i> fusions. Exon 14 skipping in <i>MET<\/i> was detected in 14 samples, of which we were able to detect a likely splice site variant SNV or indel at, or near the boundaries of exon 14, with the DNA assays of the panel. These variants were observed in a mutually exclusive set of 59 total samples (6.5% of the samples).<br \/>Conclusions: We used the OPA panel for fusions and intragenic rearrangements that retains the simple workflow and fast turn-around time of previous Oncomine fusion, and demonstrated known and novel fusion detection as well exon skip variant detection capabilities in a research cohort of lung FFPE samples.

These models have been genomically characterized using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNAseq. The resource provides a unique opportunity to explore the genomic features of rare tumor models in NCI PDMR and to understand the oncogenic processes in pre-clinical models to identify biomarkers associated with therapeutic responses.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Genomic characterization was done in 4-6 PDX samples across multiple passages and lineages from each model. As the samples exhibited a high level of genomic stability within each model, consensus mutation and copy number variation (CNV), microsatellite instability (MSI), genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH), homologous recombination deficiency score (scarHRD), and mutational signature data were generated from WES. Fusions were identified from RNASeq data using Star-Fusion and FusionInspector. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted from the gene expression data obtained from RNAseq.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 1) 233 PDX models have been developed and characterized from more than 45 different rare malignancies. Most frequent cancer types are different sarcomas (n=63), head &#38; neck squamous cell carcinoma (n=61), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) (n=11); 2) TP53 was the most frequently altered gene, mutated in 51% of models, followed by NOTCH1 (16%) and PIK3CA (11%). In terms of CNVs, ovarian epithelial cancer (OVT) showed relatively high chromosomal instability, while uterine endometrioid carcinoma (UEC) and synovial sarcoma (SYNS) had low instability; 3) MSI-H was observed in only 7 models. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (ESCA), OVT, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) had high scarHRD and genomic LOH scores, while both scores were low in UEC and anal squamous cell carcinoma (ANSC). COSMIC v2 mutational signature 3 is significantly associated with a high scarHRD score (p-value &#60; 0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test); 4) Characteristic fusions were observed in certain sarcoma models: SS18-SSX1 and ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusions were observed in SYNS and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) models respectively. EWSR1-FLI1 fusion was present in 2 out of 3 Ewing sarcoma (ES) models. 5) Gene set enrichment analysis from RNASeq data showed that epithelial-mesenchymal transition score could accurately distinguish carcinoma from sarcoma models, confirming the divergent gene expression programs.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Comprehensive genomic characterization of NCI PDMR models generated from rare cancers solves an unmet need in the community.

Lack of understanding of BoM evolution and heterogeneity at patient specific levels and precise application of targeted therapies are major challenges of managing BoM. In this study, we described in depth histologic and molecular characterization of a case of invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) bilateral metastasis to bone, and identified and tested potential targets for treating BoM. H&#38;E\/IHC staining, whole exome sequencing (WES), and RNAseq were performed on FFPE primary tumor and pelvis and tibia BoMs collected from our study case. Organoids were derived from the two BoMs and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) undertaken on the organoids and their originating tumors. H&#38;E\/IHC demonstrated evolution of the disease from an ER+ primary ILC to ER- BoM with mixed lobular and ductal carcinoma features. WES revealed two druggable mutations including PIK3CA (E545K) and BRCA1 (D1813H\/H399P). RNAseq revealed upregulation of TGF-&#946;, Wnt\/beta-catenin and PI3K pathways, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis in BoM compared to primary tumor, representing promising targets for BoM. scRNAseq revealed 5 major cell types including epithelial, fibroblasts, immune, osteoclasts and endothelial cells, and pronounced intracellular heterogeneity. Six epithelial clusters were identified, featuring high TNF-&#945; signaling, high partial EMT signatures regulated by PRRX1\/2, TWIST1\/2, and FOXS1, high proliferation, and endocrine resistance signatures. In fibroblasts, 9 clusters were identified representing ECM remodeling, angiogenesis, osteoclast-like, MSC, IFN response and myofibroblasts. Immune cells majorly composed of monocytes\/macrophages, CD4+, CD8+ and Treg T cells, and NK cell. WES and scRNAseq analysis demonstrated that organoids preserved mutational landscape and cellular heterogeneity of matched BoMs. Consistent with the BRCA1 and PIK3CA mutations, organoids were responsive to a PARP (Talazoparib: IC<sub>50<\/sub> 1.3uM) and PI3K (Alpelisib: IC<sub>50<\/sub> 4-9uM) inhibitors. In summary, we have identified potential therapeutic targets from understanding evolution and heterogeneity of BC BoM, and evaluated these in patient-specific organoids, thereby providing insights for the design of a precision medicine based clinical treatment strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c162d18c-a652-49c1-9942-c539902ae4f0\/@y03B8ZHk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,Multiomics analysis,Precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16400"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kai Ding<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fangyuan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nolan Priedigkeit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel D.

Previous studies in small GBC cohorts have suggested potential molecular alterations associated with poor prognosis, however, a comprehensive understanding of the recurrent genetic events in this cancer type is very limited. In this study, we aim to characterize in detail the recurrent molecular alterations in GBC and their association with pathologic and clinical characteristics.<br \/>Material and Methods: We studied the prevalence of somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNA) in n=244 GBC samples (54% primary, 56% metastatic), collected from 2014 to 2021, and sequenced with the targeted NGS panel MSK-IMPACT. We assessed the correlation of the recurrent genomic variants with several pathologic (<i>e.g.,<\/i> T stage, N stage, grade, histologic subtypes) and clinical characteristics (<i>e.g.,<\/i> clinical stage) using Fisher's exact test. We also used Cox Proportional-Hazards modeling to assess the correlation between genetic variants and patient overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: The most common histologic subtypes in this GCB cohort included adenocarcinomas NOS (83%), carcinomas with squamous differentiation (9%), high-grade carcinomas (4%), and carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation (3%). Most patients were diagnosed with stage IV (65%) and stage III (11%) disease at the time of biopsy\/resection, and the mean OS survival was 29.4 months. The most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (59%), SMAD4 (21%), ARID1A (19%), PIK3CA (10%), KRAS (7%), and ERBB2 (7%). Potentially recurrent oncogenic CNAs included deep deletions in CDKN2A (14%) and CDKN2B (14%), and amplifications in MDM2 (12%), ERBB2 (10%), CCNE1 (9%), MYC (7%), and KRAS (7%). RB1, PBRM1, and CTNNB1 variants were more common in cases with neuroendocrine differentiation, whereas alterations in IKZF1 and AGO2 were enriched in cases with squamous differentiation. The most significant event associated with shorted OS was chromosome 12q13-15 amplification i.e., CDK4 p=0.03 HR=2 [95% CI 1-3.6] and MDM2 p=0.05 HR=1.6 [1-2.5], which associated with a median OS of 20 months (vs. 34 months in the wild-type). Genomic variants associated with longer OS included ERBB2 (p=0.006 HR=0.2 [0.06-0.6]), KMT2C (p=0.03 HR=0.2 [0.1-0.9]) and KMT2D (p=0.01 HR=0.2 [0.04-0.7]) mutations, and CDK12 amplification (p=0.04 HR=0.4 [0.2-0.96]). Although ERBB2 amplification was not associated with prognosis, co-amplification of CDK12 and ERBB2 (chromosome 17q12) was frequently observed (Pearson correlation r=0.8).<br \/>Conclusions: This large-scale genomic analysis reveals recurrent genomic events potentially associated with prognosis in GBC, including single nucleotide variants in ERBB2, KMT2C, and KMT2D, in addition to CNAs in chromosome 12q13-15 and 17q12 regions. This effort will continue to include a detailed analysis of recurrent structural variants, loss of heterozygosity loci, and analysis of the microbiota in this GBC cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4efe3198-fdb8-458b-9731-9884aa8ca068\/@y03B8ZHk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: other,Genomics,Biomarkers,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16401"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicolas A.

Typically, these fusions are detected using low-resolution karyotyping, low throughput and biased FISH assays, or RNA sequencing approaches; however, the accuracy and sensitivity of gene fusion detection can be limited by factors such as low transcript abundance, transcript length, RNA degradation from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues, or the limited availability of fresh biopsy samples for RNA extraction. To address these limitations, we developed a novel approach to identifying gene fusions from FFPE samples using the Arima-HiC platform and short-read sequencing. We performed pan-cancer analysis on 12 FFPE adult tumor biopsies, each with gene fusions known to be clinically actionable. With this newly developed Hi-C workflow we identified all the known gene fusions with 100% sensitivity in the samples including those involving <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>NTRK3<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i>, <i>FGFR2, <\/i>and<i> SS18 <\/i>genes. This approach also revealed that the <i>NTRK3<\/i> gene fusion was the result of a more complex rearrangement within chr12, within chr15, and between chr12 and chr15. Additionally, we detected the presence of numerous structural variants per sample in addition to the known gene fusion in each sample. For example in a bile duct tumor, Arima-HiC detected an <i>FGFR2-EEA1<\/i> gene fusion, as well as 25 other structural variants genome-wide including in a <i>CPD<\/i>-<i>LASP1<\/i> gene fusion This gene fusion has not been reported to our knowledge, however, LASP1 is a reported 3&#8217; fusion partner with <i>MLL<\/i> in leukemia. While these findings are not clinically actionable today, the unbiased, accurate, and sensitive detection of structural variants from frozen and FFPE solid tumor biopsies may facilitate further research into their relationship between disease mechanisms and clinical outcomes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the analytical utility of Arima Hi-C sequencing technology to provide both chromosome-scale and gene-level resolution for the detection of structural variants in tumor biopsies samples. This workflow can provide improved access to critical genomic information from FFPE blocks for the identification of pathognomonic and druggable gene fusion events and other structural variants across tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a27be12-c1bc-4b90-ada4-0f706eb8dcb6\/@y03B8ZHk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene fusion,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16404"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Jacob Hermel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Sikkink<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derek Reid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Schmitt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Darren S.
