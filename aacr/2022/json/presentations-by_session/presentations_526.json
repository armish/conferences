[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies are treatment options for <i>RAS<\/i> and <i>BRAF<\/i> V600 mutation-negative CRC patients. However, the literature suggests that CRC patients with sub-clonal <i>RAS<\/i> and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations may still benefit from anti-EGFR<i> <\/i>therapies. The Guardant INFORM&#8482; real-world clinical-genomic database was utilized to assess the impact of sub-clonal <i>RAS<\/i> and <i>BRAF<\/i> alterations detected in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by the Guardant360&#174; test on the clinical outcome of CRC patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients were selected from the Guardant INFORM&#8482; database using the following inclusion criteria: diagnosed with advanced CRC in the US; treated with anti-EGFR therapies starting within 90 days after a Guardant360 test result; and the presence of <i>BRAF<\/i> V600E and\/or canonical <i>KRAS\/NRAS<\/i> mutations (codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, 146). Time to next treatment (TTNT) and overall survival (OS) were compared for various <i>RAS\/BRAF<\/i> mutation clonality cutoffs using the Cox proportional hazards model.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of the 13,798 CRC patients in the Guardant INFORM database, 91% had detectable ctDNA, 913 received a Guardant360&#174; test before anti-EGFR therapy, and 446 (48.8%) initiated anti-EGFR therapy within 90 days after the test. Among this cohort, 11% (n = 50) had a <i>BRAF<\/i> V600E mutation and 9% (n = 40) had a <i>RAS<\/i> mutation. The median <i>RAS\/BRAF<\/i> clonality was 0.84 (IQR = 0.57, 1.00). The associated clinical outcomes for patients with sub-clonal and clonal <i>RAS\/BRAF<\/i> mutations using clonality cutoffs from 0.3 to 0.8 are reported (Table).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Using a liquid biopsy-based clinical-genomic dataset, we demonstrate that patients harboring sub-clonal <i>RAS<\/i> or <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations benefit from anti-EGFR therapy to a degree similar to wild-type patients. Given the limited patient numbers, this finding warrants additional investigation into the utility of ant-EGFR therapies as a treatment option for this subgroup of CRC patients.<table

To support epidemiological research, we initiated a registry that enrolls patients diagnosed with a solid tumor and profiled with NGS. Collecting and standardizing variables of interest across the patient journey is critical for data harmonization and understanding clinical relevance. We propose a framework for identifying core variables most critical for solid tumor-based, real-world data studies and registries in precision oncology.<br \/>A patient representative and panel of experts in NGS, oncology, epidemiology, bioinformatics, molecular tumor boards, clinical coordination, and molecular pathology was assembled to compile a draft variables list. To reduce the burden of data collection and missingness, the variables were categorized by decreasing importance and reconciled with draft European Medicines Agency guidelines at the time of writing (final guidelines released October 26, 2021) on registry-based studies. If applicable, internationally harmonized coding dictionaries were used to standardize the variables.<br \/>The variable list was created to: describe a patient&#8217;s cancer history and journey effectively; allow conduct of comparative effectiveness studies and comparisons with clinical trials; and represent key risk factors or important confounders for prognosis or statistical analysis adjustments. The draft list comprised ~500 variables and was reconciled to ~150; highest priority was given to patient information (e.g. consent, demographics, risk and prognostic factors, dates of cancer-related events), NGS test results (e.g. actionable alterations, genomic signatures), cancer details (e.g. disease ontology, staging, metastases), and therapy details\/outcomes (e.g. treatment information, response, progression, death). Variables with moderate to lower priority comprised NGS (e.g. technical, quality criteria), familial cancer history, adherence to molecular tumor board recommendations, and primary cause of death.<br \/>This list provides viable guidance for conducting research- and regulatory-grade real-world data-based precision oncology studies, and facilitating standardized data collection and thus pooling from various datasets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d7b6837-9f16-452b-90c7-280260bf03cf\/@x03B8ZQV\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression profiling,cancer registries,core variables,precision oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17590"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rodrigo Dienstmann<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clare Turnbull<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allan Hackshaw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Yves Blay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maud Kamal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Servant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Geissler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Tamborero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janick Weberpals<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Fear<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camille Perret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Perez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Von Meyenn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Le Tourneau<\/i><\/presenter>.

Among all 263 ER+\/Her2- subjects, the median TTD of endocrine monotherapies was 3.0 months (95% CI: 2.8-3.7 months, N=263) in all subjects, 3.7 months (95% CI: 3.0-4.3 months, N=186) in PgR+ group and 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.9-2.9 months, N=77) in PgR- group. Among 186 ER+\/PgR+\/Her2- subjects, 1) the median TTD of endocrine monotherapies was 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.8-4.6 months, N=153) in ECOG&#60;=1 group and 3.7 months (95% CI: 3.2-6.0 months, N=33) in ECOG=2 group; 2) the median TTD of endocrine monotherapies was 3.4 months (95% CI: 2.3-5.4 months, N=47) in Aromatase inhibitors group, 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.8-5.6 months, N=110) in Fulvestrant group, and 3.1 months (95% CI: 2.3-6.0 months, N=29) in Tamoxifen group; 3) the median TTD of endocrine monotherapies was 3.6 months (95% CI: 2.8-5.9 months, N=74) in one prior treatment line group, 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.0-6.0 months, N=57) in two prior treatment lines group, and 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.3-5.4 months, N=55) in &#62;=3 prior treatment lines group.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>By investigating the RWD, we observed that the PgR status is prognostic in post CDK setting: endocrine monotherapies in PgR+ group has longer TTD compared to PgR- group in ER+\/Her2- mBC subjects. By further looking into ER+\/PgR+\/Her2- subjects, we observed different treatment durations of endocrine therapies in various clinical scenarios, which may provide a helpful understanding of the mBC monotherapy treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ee9cf192-a1dd-4357-9c86-deff62c7c19b\/@x03B8ZQV\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic tumors,Real world evidence,Breast cancer,Endocrine therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17591"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tenghui Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaojie Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Scholz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonio Gualberto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lihua Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kun Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Apatinib is a small molecule TKI inhibitor. Its efficacy and safety for unresectable HCC patients have been demonstrated in randomized controlled clinical studies. However, the efficacy and safety of apatinib in real world is lacking. We are aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in real world.<b>Methods<\/b>Patients of older than 18 years with unresectable HCC confirmed by IHC (Immunohistochemistry) or CT and MR Imaging were enrolled in the study. All patients received apatinib monotherapy or combined with other treatments including TACE and chemotherapy. The enrolled patients were treated until disease progression, death, or severe intolerable toxicity, etc. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The adverse events (AEs) were also recorded.<b>Results<\/b>From February, 2019 to May, 2020, a total of 233 patients were enrolled. Among them, 66 (28.33%) patients received apatinib monotherapy and 167 (71.67%) patients received combination therapy. Patients with a history of hepatitis accounted for 70%. 8 patients achieved complete response (CR), 64 patients achieved partial response (PR), 120 patients achieved stable disease (SD), and 41 patients had progressive disease (PD), illustrating an ORR of 30.90% and a DCR of 82.40%. Median PFS and OS were 6.93 months (95% CI, 6.19-7.68 months) and 11.36 months (95% CI, 9.96-12.77 months), respectively. The safety profile indicated that the most common drug-related adverse events were hypertension (37.90%), hand-foot-skin reaction (27.39%), fatigue (19.11%), thrombocytopenia (16.02%). Grade 3\/4 treatment related AEs included thrombocytopenia (4.30%), hypertension (3.82%), neutropenia (2.73%). After symptomatic treatment, all the adverse events were treated properly, and no unexpected adverse events were observed. <b>Conclusions <\/b>In current study, apatininb showed good tolerance with acceptable toxicity and high tumor response rate that translated into promising PFS and OS in unresectable HCC patients.

However, the relationship between UGT1A1 genotype and the safety and efficacy of irinotecan monotherapy in the treatment of Chinese advanced gastric cancer remains unclear.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A total of 110 patients were enrolled. Intravenous irinotecan was administered every 3 weeks. Irinotecan dose was selected according to the polymorphism of UGT1A1 gene, which was divided into 3 groups: UGT1A1*6 wild-type (GG type): 125mg\/m2, d1, d8; UGT1A1*6 mutant heterozygosity (GA type) 100mg\/m2, d1, d8; UGT1A1*6 homozygosity mutation (AA type) 75mg\/m2, d1, d8 or paclitaxel 125mg\/m2, d1, d8. UGT1A1 genotypes were determined by direct sequencing or next-generation sequencing of genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among 110 patients of the subjects, the genotypes of UGT1A1*28 were wild-type in 78 patients (70.91%), mutant heterozygosity in 28 (25.45%) and mutant homozygosity in 4 (3.64%). UGT1A1*6 were GG in 67 cases (60.91%), GA in 35 cases (31.82%), and AA in 8 cases (7.27%). There were two heterozygous mutations in 3 patients, and no homozygous mutation was detected. A total of 10 cycles of irinotecan were administered, with a median of five cycles per patient. There was no significant difference in the risk of delayed diarrhea and granulocytopenia in patients with different UGT1A1*28 genotypes (P&#62;0.05), while there was significant difference in the risk of delayed diarrhea and granulocytopenia in patients with different UGT1A1*6 genotypes (P&#60;0.05).

In Japan, P-ad-ca was reported to be only 4-6% of all CRC. NEC is also rare. The incidence of that were reported to be less than 1%. One of their points of common is morphological poorly differentiated appearance. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of NEC contaminated in the CRC given a confirmed diagnosis as P-ad-ca.<br \/><b><i>Material and Method:<\/i><\/b> From 2009 to 2019, 816 CRCs were resected in department of Yokohama City University Hospital and 74 cases showing P-ad-ca or having a small region of P-ad-ca with well or moderately differentiated ad-ca (W-ad-ca, M-ad-ca). Among the 74 cases, there were 8 of P-ad-ca, 4 of W-ad-ca with P-ad-ca, 44 of M-ad-ca with P-ad-ca, and 18 W-ad-ca and M-ad-ca with P-ad-ca. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using neuroendocrine markers (NM) including chromogranin A, synaptophysin and insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) was performed to identified NEC. Recently, a high incidence of Rb protein loss was reported in NEC of several organs, then IHC using Rb monoclonal antibody was also performed.

Compared to molecular tumor heterogeneity using modern multi-omics approach, tumor heterogeneity in response to therapy has not been adequately studied. We aimed to characterize such tumor heterogeneity and evaluate its association with outcome in patients with mCRC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We used individual patient data from a clinical trial (NCT00364013) in Project Data Sphere who received first-line FOLFOX for mCRC and had &#8805;2 baseline metastatic target lesions. We used standard deviations of following tumor features in an individual patient to represent tumor heterogeneity: percentage change in size of a target lesion from baseline to first radiographic evaluation (H1), average speed of such percentage change in size as defined in H1 (H2), percentage change in size of a target lesion from baseline to the time of its best response to therapy (H3), and average speed of such percentage change in size as defined in H3 (H4). Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate association of tumor heterogeneity with survival.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Mean age of 328 patients included was 61 years. Median follow-up time was 18.2 months. 85% of them had liver metastasis; 15% had lung metastasis. All tumor heterogeneity variables in response to therapy (H1-4) were higher (p&#60;0.001) in patients with disease progression compared to those without. In univariate analyses, higher tumor heterogeneity H1 (HR 7.2, 95% CI 2.3-22.6), H2 (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.7), H3 (HR 6.4, 95% CI 2.1-19.3), and H4 (HR 4.1, 95% CI 2.4-7.1) were associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p&#60;0.001). H4 high group (median as cutoff) had a shorter median PFS of 7.3 months compared to H4 low group (9.1 months, p=0.005). In multivariable analysis, higher H1 (HR 8.0, 95% CI 2.2-28.9, p=0.002), H2 (HR 3.9, 95% CI 2.0-7.6, p&#60;0.001), H3 (HR 6.4, 95% CI 1.9-21.9, p=0.003), or H4 (HR 5.1, 95% CI 2.9-9.1, p&#60;0.001) was each associated with a shorter PFS, after adjusted for baseline number of metastatic sites, number of target lesions, tumor size, age, albumin, ECOG, and lymph node metastasis.

MBL is the precursor to CLL. The incidence of cutaneous SCC in CLL is significantly higher compared to controls. The incidence of SCC in MBLs has not yet been determined. Study participants from the Mayo Clinic Biobank who had no prior history of hematologic malignancy, were 40 years or older, and were Olmsted County residents completed a health questionnaire and provided blood samples between 7\/2009 and 12\/2020. Stored peripheral blood mononuclear cells were screened for MBL using flow cytometry. We defined three MBL immunophenotypes: CLL-like MBL (CD5+, CD20dim), atypical MBL (CD5+, CD20+), and non-CLL-like MBL (CD5-, CD20+). MBL individuals were also classified by cell count into low-count MBL (LC-MBL) and high-count MBL (HC-MBL), with HC-MBL having a percent clonal B-cell count &#8805;85%. Data on newly diagnosed SCC was abstracted from the medical records, and prior history of skin cancer before sample collection was ascertained from patient questionnaires. Individuals were followed from sample date to the earliest of SCC, death, loss to follow-up, progression, or 12\/31\/2020. Cumulative SCC incidence was adjusted for competing risk of death. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for age and sex. A total of 5,470 participants were screened for MBL and included 949 (17%) with LC-MBL, 63 (1%) with HC-MBL, and 4,458 (81%) controls (negative for MBL). Individuals with HC-MBL (median age 75 years) or LC-MBL (median age 73 years) were significantly older (P&#60;0.001) than controls (median age 66 years). There were 41 (65%) males among HC-MBL, 447 (47%) among LC-MBL, and 1,551 (35%) among controls. Prior skin cancer history was highest among HC-MBLs (N=17, 27%) or LC-MBLs (N=236, 25%) compared to controls (N=767, 17%). After a median follow-up of 18 months (range 0-138), 154 of the 5,470 individuals were identified to have incident SCC following MBL screening. At least one SCC was observed in 3 individuals with HC-MBL, 33 individuals with LC-MBL, and 118 controls. The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidence of SCC in individuals with MBLs was 7% and 16%, respectively; control estimates were 4% and 8%, respectively. However, after adjusting for age and sex, we observed no evidence of an association between MBL and risk of incident SCC (HR=0.95, CI=0.65-1.40, P=0.80), nor when we stratified individuals by age or by sex (all P&#62;0.05). In the largest MBL screening cohort to date, individuals with MBL do not have an increased risk of incident SCC compared to controls. In contrast to individuals with CLL, these individuals with screening MBL do not need increased dermatologic examination for skin cancer, which is important given the high prevalence of MBL (18% of the population above age 40).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2cb9a6de-d416-447d-86c7-f615e0fd5562\/@y03B8ZQW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Squamous cell carcinoma,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Incidence,monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18528"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ahmed Nadeem Ansari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara J.

Currently, there is no data on utilization of MSI\/MMR testing for EC in Europe. This study aims to assess the real-world prevalence of MSI\/MMR testing and related tumor status in women with recurrent or advanced EC (aEC) in Europe.<br \/>Methodology: Endometrial Cancer Health Outcomes-Europe (ECHO-EU) is a multicenter retrospective chart review study in United Kingdom (UK), Germany (GE), Italy (IT) and Spain (SP). Physicians extracted de-identified data from medical records of women (&#8805;18 years) diagnosed with aEC, who progressed after prior systemic therapy between July 2016 and July 2019. Patients&#8217; demographics, clinical characteristics, and MSI\/MMR testing data were collected. Women were categorized by MSI\/MMR status.<br \/>Results: Interim data from 81 physicians included 349 eligible women (UK=83, GE=64, IT=102, SP=100). More than 85% of physicians were medical oncologists and 91% had a hospital-based practice. At aEC diagnosis, eligible women were on average 68 years, 91% were Stage III\/IV, and 56% had endometrioid carcinoma. Overall, 36% of patients were tested by either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for MSI or immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR (UK=33%, GE=31%, IT=25%, SP=55%). Of those with &#8805;1 test, 54% were tested prior to systemic therapy initiation, with large inter-country differences (16-70%), 20% were MSI-high\/deficient MMR (dMMR), 73% were non-MSI-high\/proficient MMR (pMMR), and 7% had a mixed result. (Table)<br \/>Conclusion: Overall MSI\/MMR testing rates in Europe are low. Approximately 1 in 5 tested patients had MSI-high\/dMMR tumors and three quarters had non-MSI-high\/pMMR tumors. Knowledge regarding MSI\/MMR testing and related tumor status may be helpful for optimal utilization of targeted therapies for aEC patients in Europe.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"

These HRF include pathologic T4 disease, perineural invasion (PNI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), an inadequate lymphadenectomy (less than 12 lymph nodes harvested) and poorly differentiated tumors. The presence of two or more HRF has an additive impact on survival for patients with Stage II CC. While T4 and disease greater than N1a raise the risk of mortality in Stage III CC, the effect of the other accepted HRF in patients with Stage III CC has not been studied.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods: <\/b>Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) (2010 - 2017) was used to identify patients with Stage III and IV CC. Patients with Stage III CC were then further classified by the presence of zero, 1, or 2 or more of the following HRF: pathologic T4, PNI, inadequate lymphadenectomy, or poor differentiation. Overall (OS) and cause-specific (CS) survival were calculated.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>57,640 patients with Stage III or IV CC were identified. 35,760 (62%) patients had Stage III disease and 21,880 (38%) had Stage IV disease. Among patients with Stage III disease, 16,733 (46.8%) had no HRF, 12,703 (35.5%) had 1 HRF and 6,324 (17.7%) had 2 or more HRF. For patients with 1 HRF, 4,610 (36.3%) had poor differentiation, 2,339 (18.4%) had PNI, 3,673 (28.9%) had T4 disease, and 2,078 (16.4%) had an inadequate nodal harvest. Patients with Stage III CC without HRF had the best OS (73.3%) and CS (81.4%,). This was followed by Stage III with 1 HRF (OS 63.7%, CS 71.6%) and Stage III with 2 or more HRF (OS 44%, CS 51%). Patients with Stage IV disease had the worst OS (18.1%) and CS (20.4%) (p&#60;0.05). For patients with 1 HRF, pathologic T4 conferred worse OS (57.2%) and CS (63.2%), compared to PNI (OS 66.4%, CS 73.7%), inadequate lymphadenectomy (OS 64.6%, CS 74.9%) and poor differentiation (OS 66.6%, CS 75.4%) (p&#60;0.01).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>HRF have a cumulative influence on OS and CS in patients with Stage III CC.
