[{"Abstract":"The tumor microenvironment (TME) has concentrations of extracellular ATP (eATP) 10<sup>3<\/sup>-10<sup>4<\/sup> times higher than normal healthy tissues, implying that eATP may have important roles in tumor development and progression. Our previous study, cited by a Nature Reviews Cancer paper, showed that the extracellular ATP (eATP) is internalized by tumors via macropinocytosis, a type of endocytosis, to increase intracellular ATP (iATP) levels and support tumor cells growth, drug resistance, and cancer cell movement by initiating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Recently, our lab found that eATP functions in promoting cancer cell growth, metastasis are similar to those of TGF-&#946;, a well-known EMT and cancer stem cells (CSCs) inducer. Increasing reports state that the EMT and CSCs share some molecular links, but the detailed mechanisms and inductor of them are still far from clear. In this report, eATP&#8217;s function in CSCs induction was investigated first. Result shows that eATP treatment significantly induces the protein expression level of CSC related makers, increases cell colony numbers, and cell populations with CSC markers expressed in human lung cancer A549 cells. In addition, RNA-sequencing analysis reveals the gene Stanniocalcin 1 (<i>STC1<\/i>) is significantly upregulated in both eATP and TGF-&#946; treatments. <i>STC1<\/i> gene has been reported to be a competitive biomarker in the tracking of cancers&#8217; progressing. Besides, STC1 exhibits concentration-dependent stimulation effects on electron transportation chain (ETC) and respiration. However, the detail function of <i>STC1<\/i> gene in eATP induced cell growth is unknown. To find out the mechanism, CRISPR-Cas9 technique was used to generate <i>STC1<\/i> gene targeted knockout (<i>STC1<\/i> KO) A549 cells. <i>STC1<\/i> KO cells show slower cell growth rate, lower intracellular ATP level and lower oxygen consumption rate (OCR) when compared with normal A549 cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. These results strongly indicate <i>STC1<\/i> gene involved in eATP induced cell growth by alteration iATP level and metabolic profile. Overall, this study not only unravels new role of eATP in CSC induction, but also provides new mechanism of eATP induced cell growth by altering the protein expression level of STC1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5bc1a0d6-f584-4949-aba0-a297006b741e\/@y03B8ZMF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATP,Cancer stem cells,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14658"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jingwen Song<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaozhuo Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Among them, a minority of cell subpopulation, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), which possess the self-renewal capacity and are able to generate the heterogeneous lineage of cancer cells, has been believed to be responsible for the initiation and progression of the tumor. However, it is still unclear how the stemness properties of CSCs are maintained in the tumor. Mitophagy is a process by which damaged mitochondria are cleared via autophagy. The significance of mitophagy in the maintenance of CSC has been investigated in multiple CSC types. Our recent study shows that ovarian CSCs also exhibit enhanced mitophagy, which is mainly attributed to elevated expression of mitophagy receptors BNIP3 and BNIP3L. Downregulation of BNIP3 or BNIP3L significantly diminished mitophagy in ovarian CSCs and compromised their self-renewal capability. Mechanistic investigation further revealed that enhanced NF-&#954;B signaling contributes to the increased expression of BNIP3 and BNIP3L. Inhibition of NF-&#954;B signaling pathway via p65 knockdown or specific inhibitors is able to reduce mitophagy in ovarian CSCs. In summary, our data suggest that selective inhibition of NF-&#954;B is able to deplete CSCs by interfering with mitochondria quality control in these cells and has potential to prevent tumor relapse and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fdf546ef-97cd-435f-9f11-c646e4619789\/@y03B8ZMF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NF-&#954;B,Mitochondria,Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14659"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Na Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tejinder Pal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shurui Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ananya Banerjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuetao Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kousalya Lavudi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi-En Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

We recently discovered that CSCs maintain a low A3-induced mutation burden. Using patient-sample derived spheroid culture and HGSOC cell lines, we found A3B was the only A3 members differentially expressed between CSC and non-CSC and the expression was significantly reduced in CSCs. In addition, inhibition of A3B leads to elevated frequency of CSCs and enhanced expression of the stemness factors. Important, our data suggest that DNA deaminase activity of A3B leads to induction of DNA damage thereby sensitizing HGSOC CSCs to PARPi.

Emerging studies suggest that ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) contribute to tumor relapse and chemotherapy resistance. Recent studies demonstrate that OCa cells express estrogen receptor beta (ER&#946;), which functions as a tumor suppressor. However, the status of ER&#946; expression in OCSCs and the therapeutic utility of ER&#946; agonist LY500307 for targeting OCSCs remain unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that OCSCs express ER&#946; and that treatment with ER&#946; agonist reduces stemness and promotes apoptosis of OCSCs.<br \/>Methods: We isolated subpopulations of OCSCs from SKOV3, A2780, and patient-derived ascites cells using ALDEFLUOR kit and examined the expression of ER&#946; in OCSCs using RT-qPCR. The effect of ER&#946; agonist LY500307 on OCSCs was examined utilizing cell viability, cell cycle, sphere formation, self-renewal, and apoptosis assays. Mechanistic studies were conducted using RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, and Western blot analysis. The efficacy of LY500307 on the tumor-initiating capacity of OCSCs was determined via <i>in vivo<\/i> limiting dilution assay studies using orthotopic intrabursal xenograft murine models.<br \/>Results: RT-qPCR assay showed that ER&#946;, particularly ER&#946; isoform 1, is highly expressed in OCSCs compared to non-OCSCs.

Further, LY500307 treatment resulted in G2\/M cell cycle arrest and promoted the apoptosis of OCSCs. Mechanistic studies using RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that ER&#946; agonist treatment resulted in the modulation of pathways related to cell cycle and apoptosis. Western blots and RT-qPCR assays confirmed the upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, such as FDXR and CDKN1A.

Therefore, therapies specifically targeting CSCs are urgently needed. Previous works have identified Ganglioside GD2 as a biomarker of triple negative breast cancer CSCs and suggested that GD2 is highly expressed in GBM cells. Here, we hypothesize that GD2 is also a potential biomarker of GBM CSCs and is involved with cancer stemness.<br \/>Methods: GBM cells U-87 MG and U-118 MG were sorted as GD2<sup>-<\/sup> and GD2<sup>+<\/sup> cells via FACS. Cells were cultured in 2D and 3D. 3D neurosphere size was measured and GD2 in 2D and 3D cultures was quantified via flow cytometry. Transwell migration assay was used to examine the migration capability of GD2<sup>-<\/sup> and GD2<sup>+<\/sup> cells. Unsorted cells were cultured in either complete (10% serum) or deprived (1% serum) media and their GD2 was quantified via flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: To test our hypothesis, we determined whether GD2<sup>+<\/sup> cells express CSCs capabilities of sphere-formation in 3D culture, migration, and survival in serum-deprived conditions. First, we examined the sphere-forming capability by culturing GD2<sup>-<\/sup>, GD2<sup>+<\/sup>, and unsorted cells in 3D and found that they all formed neurospheres. However, GD2<sup>+<\/sup> neurosphere size was significantly larger compared with unsorted and GD2<sup>-<\/sup> neurospheres for day 1 and 2. Interestingly, the significant difference was no longer seen on day 6. Analysis for GD2 expression in the spheres revealed that GD2<sup>-<\/sup> spheres contained GD2<sup>+<\/sup> cells, suggesting that GD2<sup>-<\/sup> cells could spontaneously dedifferentiate to generate CSCs. To test this, we sorted GD2<sup>-<\/sup> and GD2<sup>+<\/sup> cells into 2D conditions and quantified daily GD2 expression via flow cytometry. We found that GD2<sup>-<\/sup> seeded cells spontaneously expressed GD2 over six days, explaining the presence of GD2 in GD2<sup>-<\/sup> neurospheres. GD2<sup>+<\/sup> cells also demonstrated the enhanced capability to migrate of CSCs with a significantly higher number of migrated cells compared with GD2<sup>-<\/sup> cells in the transwell migration assay. To examine the ability to survive in serum-deprived conditions, we cultured unsorted cells in either complete or deprived media. We found that these cells proliferated in the serum-deprived condition at approximately the same level as complete media. GD2 analysis by flow cytometry also showed a remarkably higher percentage of GD2<sup>+ <\/sup>cells in deprived media, suggesting that GD2 is involved in driving cell survival and maintaining cancer stemness in serum-deprived conditions.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data suggests that GD2<sup>+<\/sup> cells demonstrate characteristics of CSCs and GD2 is a potential biomarker of CSCs in GBM. Therefore, GD2 could be utilized as a differential therapeutic target for GBM. Further mechanistic studies are necessary to elucidate how GD2 is synthesized and maintains the stemness of GBM CSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2d2382f7-7fc9-4cdd-b037-65afaa138a5e\/@y03B8ZMF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-06 Stem cell markers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Biomarkers,Glioblastoma multiforme,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14663"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Khoa Nguyen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minh Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kurtis Willingham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reza Izadpanah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Burow<\/i><\/presenter>.

Often diagnosed late in disease progression, PDAC is notorious for chemotherapy resistance as well as having metastases. A cell population of interest aiding in this progression is the cancer stem cell (CSC). These cells are known for having high resistance to chemotherapy, along with propagating and re-building the tumor after most non-CSCs have been therapeutically targeted. Previous studies have determined CXCR4, ALDH1, CD24, CD44, and CD133 are markers of PDAC CSCs. In the present study, we investigated CXCR1 as a marker and therapeutic target for PDAC CSCs. CXCR1 is a G-coupled transmembrane protein receptor with downstream effects known to aid in anti-apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis via binding CXCL8 and CXCL6. Already known to be a CSC marker and target in triple-negative breast cancer, initial studies by Chen et al. of CXCR1 in PDAC demonstrate CXCL8 induces increased tumorsphere formation <i>in vitro<\/i>, leading us to investigate CXCR1 in PDAC CSCs. Considering these findings, we hypothesized that <i>PDAC cells with high CXCR1 activity exhibit increased CSC-like characteristics, and targeting CXCR1 will reduce those characteristics<\/i>. To investigate the role of CXCR1 in PDAC CSC-like phenotype, we used two PDAC cell lines, CD18\/HPAF and T3M4, and developed gemcitabine resistant (GemR) counterparts. These GemR cell lines were shown to have over 10-fold higher resistance than their respective parent cell lines. We treated with the CXCR1\/2 antagonist navarixin at concentrations known to inhibit CXCR1. Using the parent cell lines&#8217; relative IC<sub>50<\/sub> concentrations for each drug, we treated cells for 72 hours. We used qRT-PCR and ELISAs for analysis of several known CSC markers and CXCR1 axis expression. From our results, we see the beginning trends of GemR cells having increased expression of CSC markers as well as gemcitabine-treated parent and resistant cells having increased expression. Using flow cytometry, we evaluated the CXCR1<sup>+<\/sup> cell populations post-control and gemcitabine treatment. The population of CXCR1<sup>+<\/sup> cells was higher in the gemcitabine-treated groups. Together, our observations suggest an association between CXCR1 and the CSC-like phenotype in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/df99a49d-d78c-4953-9d14-aef3627d289f\/@y03B8ZMF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-06 Stem cell markers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Stem cells,Chemoresistance,Gemcitabine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14675"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caitlin Molczyk<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lubaba Zaman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paran Goel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakesh K.

Identifying existing drugs for another purpose of use may be considered as a part of new approaches to overcome resistance in cancer biology. Itraconazole is a FDA-approved drug, which is one of anti-fungal drugs. This drug has been reported to exploit as a cancer therapeutic agent in several cancer types. We sought to investigate the anti-cancer effects of itraconazole on cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy and breast cancer stem cell-like properties in terms of challenging trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. The effect of itraconazole on trastuzumab-resistant cell line, JIMT-1, in vitro was examined in aspects of cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy, and impact on cancer stem cells. As in vivo experimental model, trastuzumab-resistant JIMT-1 cells were implanted to generate xenografts to study anti-tumor efficacy of itraconazole. Treatment of itraconazole significantly suppressed the growth of JIMT-1 cells with marked induction of apoptosis. Itraconazole downregulated p185HER2 and truncated-p95HER2, and their phosphorylation levels in JIMT-1 cells. In addition, the outcome of the decrease in the levels of Beclin-1 and p62 and the increase of LC3 I\/II after the exposure to itraconazole supported that itraconazole induced autophagy as well. Importantly, itraconazole not only killed proliferating tumor cells but also effectively eradicated cancer stem-like populations. To elucidate eradication of cancer stem-like population by itraconazole, ALDH1 activity assay and FACS analysis of CD44+\/CD24- stem-like phenotype in JIMT-1 cells were carried out. As a result, stem-cell like populations were impaired as evidenced by a significant decrease in ALDH1 activity and CD44+\/CD24- stem-like populations. Through in vivo mouse model, the physiological relevance of in vitro observations was confirmed. Evident inhibition of tumor burden and growth in trastuzumab-resistant xenografts was shown in consequence of itraconazole administration, accompanying by substantial downregulation of HER2, ALDH1 and microvessel density as well as dramatic decrease of p62 in vivo. No injury to liver or kidneys by itraconazol was found based on no statistically significant difference in serum levels of ALT, AST and BUN between vehicle- and itraconazole-administrated groups. We have demonstrated that itraconazole, which is FDA-approved drug as an anti-fungal drug, exerts anti-tumor activity in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer by targeting cancer stem-like properties, suppression of the HER2 signaling as well as induction of autophagy. These findings support the notion that itraconazole might be a new strategic approach as a treatment for trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Itraconazole,Drug re-purposing,Trastuzumab resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14681"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jung Min Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soeun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minsu Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seongjae Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juyeon Seo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongmi Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kee Dal Nam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoon-Jae Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Hong Seo<\/i><\/presenter>.

Ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) are hypothesized to contribute to the emergence of chemoresistant tumors. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) is an intracellular enzyme that oxidizes toxic aldehydes to carboxylic acids and plays a role in controlling cell differentiation pathways. We have previously used ALDH1A1 activity as a functional marker to identify OCSCs and demonstrated that OCSCs persist after chemotherapy and drive recurrent, drug resistant disease. However, the mechanism by which ALDH1A1 maintains stemness phenotype remains poorly understood. To examine the effect of ALDH1A1 on cellular survival signals in OCSCs, we generated a novel ALDH1A1-specific small molecule inhibitor named compound 974. Treatment of HGSOC cell lines with compound 974 reduced ALDH enzyme activity (p&#60;0.01) and inhibited stem-like properties including spheroid formation (p&#60;0.01) and clonogenic survival (p&#60;0.05). Compound 974 treatment inhibited (p&#60;0.01) stemness genes <i>Prom1, Bmi1, Oct4<\/i> and <i>Nanog<\/i>. ALDH1A1 inhibition also reduced (p&#60;0.05) cisplatin IC50 and synergized (p&#60;0.05) with cisplatin treatment. To further examine the effect of compound 974 to inhibit ALDH1A1 and consequently tumor initiation, mice were injected with 10<sup>6<\/sup>, 10<sup>5<\/sup> and 10<sup>4<\/sup> OVCAR3 cells treated <i>in vitro<\/i> with compound 974 (5&#181;M for 48h). In a parallel study, mice were injected with 10<sup>6<\/sup>, 10<sup>5<\/sup> and 10<sup>4<\/sup> of ALDH1A1 knockdown or scrambled control cells. In both cases, tumor initiation was significantly delayed compared to the control, and extreme limiting dilution analysis further revealed that compound 974 reduced (p&#60;0.05) CSC frequency<i> <\/i>compared to control<i>. <\/i>To better understand the mechanism by which ALDH1A1 maintains OC stemness,<i> <\/i>OVCAR3 cells treated with vehicle or compound 974 were analyzed by RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that compound 974 significantly (FDR &#60; 0.05, fold change &#62; 2) downregulated expression of markers strongly associated with CSC phenotypes (<i>NF-&#954;B, CD44, Klf4, Sox9, Fzd7<\/i>) and chemoresistance (<i>ABCB1<\/i>). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for downstream regulators of differentially expressed genes revealed that the senescence pathway was significantly altered. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that compound 974 inhibited (p&#60;0.01) chemotherapy-induced expression of senescence marker <i>p21<\/i> and senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes including <i>IL6, IL8, CXCL1 and CXCL3<\/i>. Compound 974 also inhibited(p&#60;0.05) the chemotherapy-induced beta-galactosidase activity. Collectively, our findings further support the functional role for ALDH1A1 in OCSC and reveal a novel role for the enzyme in chemotherapy-induced senescence and disease relapse.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{E87FC67E-248A-48BB-82AF-59344F3FBB5D}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/186cf99b-aac8-4690-9704-fe1c04b6dc0c\/@y03B8ZMF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Chemoresistance,Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1A1,Cellular senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14682"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vaishnavi Muralikrishnan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fang Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tyler C.

Current treatment modalities for patients with CRC include surgery, which is often followed with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) based adjuvant chemotherapy. While such treatment regimens are effective at improving disease outcomes, their clinical usefulness is often hampered due to emergence of chemotherapeutic resistance. Presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been attributed towards 5FU-mediated drug resistance which subsequently leads to poor prognosis in CRC patients. In this study we investigated a novel therapeutic strategy by using metformin along with ICG-001, a Wnt signaling inhibitor, as an approach to abrogate CSC mediated chemoresistance in 5FU resistant (5FUR) and parental CRC cells, as well as CRC patient derived tumor organoids.<br \/>Methods: Two 5FU resistant (5FUR)-CRC cell lines previously generated and characterized in our lab were used in this study. First, we performed genome-wide transcriptomic profiling followed by pathway enrichment analysis to identify differentially expressed genes and its associated pathways between parental and 5FUR CRC cells. Next, we determine the anti-tumor effects of metformin and ICG-001 by performing cell viability, colony formation, migration, and invasion analysis. Next, we explore the possible mechanism of action of these two drugs by performing gene and protein expression analysis of CSC, autophagy and apoptotic markers. We also evaluated the anti-tumor activity of metformin and ICG-001 in CRC patient derived tumor organoids.<br \/>Results: We observed that 5FUR-CRC cells exhibited increased expression of CSC markers and increased spheroid forming ability. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis followed by pathway analysis revealed that Wnt signaling pathway, pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells etc. were enriched between parental and 5FUR CRC cells. These findings prompted us to use ICG-001 which selectively targets Wnt signaling along with metformin in abrogating CSC mediated chemoresistance in CRC. We observed that a combined treatment of metformin and ICG-001 exert anti-tumor activity in by decreasing cell viability (p&#60;0.01), colony formation (p&#60;0.001), migration (p&#60;0.01), and invasion ability (p&#60;0.01) in synergistic manner. We also observed that combined treatment decreases the expression of CSC markers and promote autophagy and apoptosis. In accordance with our <i>in vitro<\/i> studies, we observed that metformin and ICG-001 exhibited anti-tumor activity in patient derived CRC organoid models in combination (p&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: We conclude that metformin and ICG-001 act synergistically, which can be used as a therapeutic strategy to overcome 5FU mediated therapeutic resistance in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f39516f4-6ace-4b2b-8bd0-431c6eade2cc\/@z03B8ZMG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Colorectal cancer,Chemoresistance,Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14683"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Souvick Roy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yinghui Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yate-Ching Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Goel<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the mechanisms by which the APOBEC3 enzymes promote cancer initiation and progression in the malignant microenvironment remains to be investigated, especially in hematopoietic malignancies. Through whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing analyses of MPN patient samples FACS sorted into stem and progenitor populations, we have found a cell type and context specific nature of these enzymes, notably the upregulation of APOBEC3C (A3C) in the high-risk Myelofibrosis (MF) stem cell population as compared to normal aged counterparts. Through lentiviral overexpression of each APOBEC3 enzyme, we can now study the effects of changes in APOBEC3 transcript level in relation to the known changes in expression seen in many cancers, focusing on the upregulation of A3C. Using these techniques, we have identified novel RNA and DNA editing targets, as well as differential gene expression patterns of each APOBEC3 in normal CD34+ cord blood and aged normal bone marrow. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) performed on this dataset has exposed numerous deregulated pathways brought on by exaggerated levels of APOBEC3, including changes in splicing pathways. In addition, novel identification of the relationship between A3C and ADAR1, another innate immune deaminase, has important implications in initiation and prognosis of MPNs. Both A3C and ADAR1 transcript levels are elevated in high risk MF stem cells, and co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal a direct binding of the enzymes. Furthermore, we are able to study the detailed effects of editing by both A3C and ADAR1 using editase-deficient mutant constructs, allowing for a mechanistic look into the role of these deaminases and their deregulation in vitro and in vivo using patient samples and humanized mouse models. This novel connection, as well as the role of A3C in initiation and progression of hematopoietic malignancies will continued to be studied using this system to elucidate effects on proliferation, differentiation, self-renewal, and changes to the cell cycle, in hopes of creating both a marker of early detection and potentially a druggable target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e6d8b9ff-5c38-465a-a599-bf428dd15395\/@z03B8ZMG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),RNA,DNA,Leukemias,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14684"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jane Marie Isquith<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Mark<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Pham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Donohoe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luisa Ladel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catriona Jamieson<\/i><\/presenter>.

Tumors are comprised of heterogenous cancer cells, which makes targeted therapies challenging. Studies have identified a subset of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) that, unlike bulk tumor cells, can evade chemotherapy and induce relapse. Cell surface markers such as CD133, CD44, CD117, or ALDH enzyme activity are typically used to identify and isolate CSCs; however, these markers are inconsistent across cell lines and patient samples making them unreliable for isolating CSCs. Consistent indicators of CSCs may be activity of stem cell transcription factors, such as SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG, which are known to promote long-term self-renewal and asymmetric division, processes required for tumor repopulation. We hypothesize that a reporter responding to SOX2 and OCT4 activity will represent a functionally relevant and reliable marker for identifying CSCs capable of enabling relapse. We have stably transduced a reporter (termed SORE6), which detects SOX2 and OCT4 activity, into OV90 and ACI23 ovarian cancer cells. SORE6+ cells, isolated using fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS), have 2 to 15-fold increases in SOX2\/OCT4\/NANOG transcripts, relative to SORE6- cells. Comparison of CSC markers in chemotherapy versus vehicle conditions suggests that SORE6 more consistently identifies the CSC population. Specifically, flow cytometry analysis of ACI23 cells showed a 2-fold increase in SORE6+ cells, 7-fold increase in CD117+ cells, and a 1.2-fold increase in CD133 cells in carboplatin treated cells relative to vehicle. For OV90, SORE6+ increases again by 2-fold, while CD117+ increases by 5-fold and CD133 increases by 1.5-fold. SORE6+ cells also showed significantly enhanced spheroid formation efficiency in low serum conditions and resistance to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapies, relative to SORE6- cells. Finally, <i>in vivo<\/i> limiting dilution studies in mice showed a significant difference in tumorigenicity of SORE6+ cells at low dilutions in ACI23 cells, but not for OV90 cells. Flow cytometry analysis of disassociated tumors showed that tumors created using pure SORE6- cells remained SORE6-, while tumors created using pure SORE6+ cells maintained only 10% SORE6+, indicating the ability of SORE6+ cells to asymmetrically divide to create a heterogeneous tumor. In conclusion, these data suggest that the SORE6 reporter identifies a CSC population within ovarian cancer cell lines and could be a useful tool for consistent isolation of CSCs. Use of this reporter will enhance our understanding of mechanisms, such as SOX2 and OCT4 activity, that support chemoresistance and tumor repopulation. More reliable identification of CSCs will enable the design of therapies to overcome chemotherapy resistance and disease recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0acf0d94-8712-4348-bbed-b82c3890c283\/@z03B8ZMG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Ovarian cancer,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14687"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luisjesus S.

Current therapy including surgery and the P6 chemotherapy regimen is insufficient, leading to a 5-year survival rate of only 15-25%. One potential explanation for this poor prognosis is the existence of a cancer stem cell (CSC) population with the ability to resist chemotherapy and cause both tumor recurrence and metastasis. While a CSC population has been identified in the closely related Ewing Sarcoma, most commonly caused by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion gene, no CSC population has yet been identified in DSRCT. In this study, novel culture conditions were developed that enabled the formation of tumorspheres <i>in vitro <\/i>in the two commonly available DSRCT cell lines: JN-DSRCT-1 and BER-DSRCT. These novel culture conditions led to upregulation of stemness genes at the RNA and protein level including NANOG and SOX2, two genes that are associated with poor survival outcomes in TCGA sarcomas data. CCK-8 assay demonstrated an increased chemoresistance for tumorspheres versus normal adherent culture especially for doxorubicin, which was confirmed by reduction in PARP cleavage. This chemoresistance may be partially explained by a more quiescent CSC state as shown by reduced cell proliferation and a lower percentage of cells in the S and G2\/M phases. However, cells grown in tumorspheres still robustly formed tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>, thus demonstrating the two hallmark CSC traits of chemoresistance and tumor formation. RNA-seq was performed to elucidate key differences between the adherent and sphere culture conditions and identify potential targets for the therapeutically important CSC-like population. Overrepresentation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis both showed upregulation of pathways related to chromatin assembly and disassembly, suggesting epigenetic changes as DSRCT cells move to a more stem-like state. RNA-seq further revealed kinases upregulated in tumorspheres including B-lymphocyte kinase (BLK) which previous studies have demonstrated is oncogenic, regulated by EWSR1-WT1, and not necessary for normal survival. BLK knockdown reduced CSC-like properties including abrogation of tumorsphere formation and reduction in the levels of SOX2 and NANOG. Together, this work for the first time identifies a CSC-like population in DSRCT and BLK as a potential DSRCT CSC target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7a169c15-43b2-451c-ab56-81b65919427d\/@z03B8ZMG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Fusion proteins,Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14689"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justin W.

Despite standard of care together with cutting-edge strategies, life expectancy stands invariantly poor. Tumor heterogeneity and its high-grade of invasiveness make it difficult to be surgically resected, and recurrence is inevitable. There is scientific consensus that tumor relapse originates from progenitor\/stem-like cells known as glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) displaying properties of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation that contribute to tumor mass heterogeneity. Thus, GSCs represent the target of newly designed therapies. In recent years, it has been highlighted the anti-cancer properties of metformin, the first-line drug in Type-2 diabetes (T2D) treatment. Metformin assumption in T2D patients has been positively linked with a decrease in the risk of several cancer types and cancer-related mortality, including glioblastoma. Additionally, numerous studies demonstrated metformin's anticancer properties against GSCs. Despite metformin's mechanism of action on cancer cells has not been clarified yet, its effect has been proposed to target the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway. Considering that GSCs have been reported to shuttle between glycolysis and OXPHOS energetic pathways, their metabolic plasticity should prevent the antiproliferative effect of metformin. However, metformin-treated GSCs show a phenotype superimposable to that caused by the blockage of the transmembrane form of the chloride intracellular channel 1 (tmCLIC1). tmCLIC1 involvement in the progression of GB has been assessed deeply <i>in vitro<\/i> as well as <i>in vivo<\/i>. In addition, its peculiar localization and enrichment on GSCs' membrane renders it a valuable pharmacological target for GB.<br \/>Here, we show that in glioblastoma, the transmembrane form of Chloride Intracellular Channel 1 (tmCLIC1) works as a privileged and unique metformin membrane receptor. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments on live cells confirm the binding to tmCLIC1. Metformin impairs tmCLIC1 activity by a specific binding on a single amino acid, the arginine29. Its mutation demonstrates that metformin-depending tmCLIC1 block is prevented, failing to reduce glioblastoma cells proliferation in 2D and 3D models as well. Moreover, <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments on zebrafish embryos closely mirror the behavior observed <i>in vitro<\/i>. Our results demonstrate that tmCLIC1 is essential for metformin antineoplastic effect in glioblastoma and prove a direct binding between the drug and its target. Considering tmCLIC1 contribution to glioblastoma progression, the present work paves the way for future investigations intended to develop a strategy aimed to enhance metformin-tmCLIC1 interaction.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) harboring cancer-driving mutations in the subventricular zone (SVZ) have recently been reported as the cells of origin for human glioblastoma (GBM) through migration. However, the pathological role of residual tumor-initiating NSCs (tNSCs) in the SVZ is undetermined for local recurrent tumor after surgical removal of the primary tumor. After the primary resection of GBM, most recurrences still appear as local tumors around the resection cavity (RC). Accordingly, we hypothesized that, after complete removal of the primary tumor, the tNSCs in SVZ might be the source for tumor construction at RC. Here, we examined the role of tNSCs in the development of local tumors around RC using a mouse model and genetic analysis of human tissues. First, cancer-driving mutations, including Trp53, Pten, and Egfr mutations, were introduced to NSCs in SVZ through <i>in vivo<\/i> electroporation, and the RC was generated in the remote cortex through stereotaxic resection. We found that the NSCs harboring driver mutations migrated specifically to the RC through the aberrant growth of oligodendrocyte-precursor cells (OPCs). Furthermore, the SVZ-originated cells constituted the GBM around the RC at four weeks post-resection in 64% of mouse models. Second, we performed deep sequencing of longitudinal matched tissues consisting of (i) normal SVZ away from the tumor, (ii) primary tumor, (iii) recurrent tumor, and (iv) blood in the patients with GBM, IDH wildtype. We found that the dominant clones of recurrent tumors genetically arose from the SVZ, not directly from the primary tumor. Third, the CXCR4\/CXCL12 axis was upregulated through migration from the SVZ and tumor formation at the RC compared with primary tumors without the RC in mouse models. Blockage of the CXCR4\/CXCL12 axis decreased the number of immigrating OPC lineage cells specifically and improved tumor control and survival rates. Taken together, our results reveal that the residual tNCSs harboring cancer-driving mutations in the SVZ can re-construct tumors after surgical resection of GBM. Blocking CXCL12\/CXCR4 might be a potential treatment strategy for preventing the main local failures after resection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30e4f14c-48f3-45c2-8507-3cd2fa5123ba\/@z03B8ZMG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Neural stem cell,Subventricular zone,Resection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20970"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xue Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Jung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong-Gyun Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joo Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

Glioblastoma patients have a 5 percent five-year survival rate and drug-resistant tumors often recur following surgical resection and treatment with radiation or chemotherapy. The cancer stem cell hypothesis suggests the presence of a subset of undifferentiated cells, namely glioma stem cells (GSCs), in the heterogenous tumor mass that are likely responsible for tumor initiation and recurrence of tumors post resection and give rise to drug resistant tumors. Determining a way to suppress these malignant characteristics and\/or depleting the GSC population could improve current cancer treatments and the survival of glioma patients. Some GSCs are similar to oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), found during neural development and also residing in the adult brain. OPCs are prone to malignant transformation and believed to be a cellular origin for glioma. Recent findings indicate that the well-characterized neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) maintains the primitive state of normal OPCs via muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) preventing maturation and cell cycle exit. We investigated the functional characterization of ACh and mAChRs in modulating malignancy in OPC-like cells. We studied cultures of primary mouse OPC-like GSCs. We used the primary cells to culture three-dimensional tumor organoids in vitro to better represent tumor heterogeneity. We also used patient derived xenografts (PDX) of glioma to grow flank xenografts in NSG mice for an in vivo model. Publicly available data and studies in our lab show high levels of expression of <i>CHRM3 <\/i>(M3mAChR) in glioma patients and in primary OPC like GSCs. A drug screen conducted in the context of multiple sclerosis determined that benztropine (BZT), an anti muscarinic drug targeting M3mAChR, causes normal OPCs to exit the cell cycle, lose stem cell like characteristics, and differentiate. In our lab, electrophysiological studies demonstrated that activation of mAChRs in OPC-like cells from mouse and patient tumors generates rapid (&#60; 1 second) increases in cytosolic calcium. Pharmacologic studies indicated that treatment with FDA approved anti muscarinic benztropine suppresses proliferation in cultured glioma cells. We also observed that serially passaging flank tumors treated with BZT into new host mice slowed down recurrence of new tumors. In order to determine key receptors mediating cholinergic responses in OPC-like cells we performed protein quantification, which displayed lowered phosphorylation of ERK.

The development of intra-peritoneal metastases is correlated with the formation of multicellular spheroids by OC cells disseminated in the peritoneal fluid. Within a spheroid, OC cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which involves changes in the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and acquisition of cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics, therefore protecting OC cells during chemotherapy. Cluster of differentiation 166 (CD166) is one of the CAMs involved in tumor progression and its modulation impacts cell-cell adhesion, leading to impaired ability of tumor cells to metastasize. However, limited number of studies are available on the functional role of CD166 in the initiation, progression, and chemoresistance of OC. Our goal was to investigate the contribution of CD166 in supporting chemoresistance and the tumorigenic OCSC phenotype, thus proposing this molecule as a potential new therapeutic target in OC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We compared CD166 expression in primary OC cells grown as spheroids and monolayers and in chemoresistant versus sensitive OC cell lines by q-PCR and Western Blot (WB). CD166 blockade by shRNA knockdown (KD) or anti-CD166 inhibitory antibody (clone AZN-L50) was evaluated on spheroid assay and colony formation. Combinatorial carboplatin and AZN-L50 treatment was assessed on spheroid assays and by WB of pro-apoptotic proteins. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay detected the interaction between the &#946;-catenin and the CD166 promoter.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> OC cells grown as spheroids showed a significant increase in CD166 expression compared to monolayers. Our results also demonstrated an increase in CD166 expression levels in chemoresistant OC cell lines when compared to the chemosensitive counterpart. A comparison of normal adjacent ovarian epithelium, localized, and metastatic OC tissues on a multitissue array revealed that CD166 expression coincided with an advanced promigratory phenotype (n=88, P&#60;0.001), correlating with poor outcome. CD166 blockade by either shRNA-mediated KD or AZN-L50 treatment in combination with carboplatin led to a significant decrease in the expression levels of stemness-related genes, spheroid and colony formation. The combination of carboplatin and CD166 blockade increased cleaved-PARP and -caspase-3 levels compared to single agent alone, indicating sustained DNA damage. Mechanistically, &#946;-catenin-KD decreased CD166<i> <\/i>expression levels and &#946;-catenin coimmunoprecipitated with the CD166<i> <\/i>promoter, suggesting that CD166 is a direct &#946;-catenin target.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>CD166 is strongly linked to chemoresistance and is regulated by the oncogenic &#946;-catenin pathway. Our data suggest that inhibition of CD166 along with carboplatin treatment could be a potential combination therapy in OC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/900ead30-92fe-429a-b0f0-618afe876d0a\/@z03B8ZMG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Cancer stem cell,&#946;-catenin,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14694"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Rula Atwani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mayuri Prasad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George E Sandusky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Salvatore Condello<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

CD133, also known as Prominin1, is a pentaspan glycosylated transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in cancer stem cells from various tumors, including melanoma, and has been associated with tumor recurrence, chemoresistance, and metastasis. To characterize and target CD133-positive cancer stem cells, patient-derived melanoma cell lines BAKP and POT, harboring BRAF<sup>WT<\/sup>\/NRAS<sup>Q61K<\/sup> and BRAF<sup>WT<\/sup>\/ NRAS<sup>Q61R<\/sup> driver mutations, respectively, were co-transduced with a Tet activator (rtTA3) and a Tet-on vector expressing CD133 (TRE3G-CD133) to produce stable doxycycline (Dox)-inducible cell lines. These cell lines were exposed to Dox (1&#181;g\/mL) to induce CD133 expression for 24 h; mRNA was extracted and subjected to RNA-seq analysis, followed by bioinformatic analyses, which revealed genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated by Dox-induced CD133 expression. Among the most significantly altered genes was amphiregulin (AREG), which increased 7-fold with Dox induction. These results were validated in both BAKP and POT cell lines by qPCR and immunoblot analysis. AREG binds EGFR and activates RAS\/RAF\/MEK\/ERK and PI3K\/AKT signaling pathways, leading to cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Consistently, cell cycle and cell growth analyses revealed that Dox-induced CD133 expression increases the percent of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, leading to increased cell growth in BAKP cells. The role of CD133 in cell proliferation via AREG upregulation was further studied with immunofluorescent and flow cytometry analysis of proliferation markers PCNA, Ki67, as well as BrdU incorporation into newly synthesized DNA in Dox-induced BAKP cells, with or without siRNA knockdown of AREG. AREG may play an integral role in melanoma progression due to its vital function in cell proliferation, serving as an attractive target for novel therapeutics in melanoma and cancers exhibiting overexpression of both CD133 and AREG. Further studies using specific AREG inhibitors or RNAi knockdown in melanoma cell lines is currently ongoing, and can further elucidate molecular mechanisms highlighting the role(s) of CD133 and AREG in melanoma cancer stem cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/abfa20c3-c0f5-4d2c-85ad-d415f4615c29\/@z03B8ZMG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Melanoma\/skin cancers,CD133,Amphiregulin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14695"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Cynthia M.

Despite radical therapy, recurrence of GBM is a frequent and relatively early event in the course of the disease. One of the putative mechanisms of early recurrence of GBM is the existence of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) that can resist therapy and subsequently establish new GBM foci. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), responsible for maintaining genome stability, may play a key role not only in the biology of germ and stem cells but also GSCs since their dysregulated expression has been described in several cancers, including GBM. Thus, the identification of specific piRNAs in GSCs could allow the distinction of these cells from other GBM cells and their eventual targeting. Some piRNAs could also be promising biomarkers useful for prognosis and prediction of disease progression.<br \/><b>Material and Methods:<\/b> Native GBM tissues dissociated using the Papain Dissociation System were used for culturing of paired cell primary cultures. Cells were divided into two aliquots with different culture conditions. GSCs were cultured in DMEM\/F12 medium supplemented with bFGF and EGF growth factors. DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used to culture non-stem GBM cells. Subsequently, the presence of neural stem cell markers CD133 and SOX2, the ability of GSCs to establish tumors in immunodeficient mice, and the ability to differentiate into more mature cell types were analyzed. RNA isolated from the paired primary cultures was used for small-RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). QIAseq miRNA Library Kit was used for the preparation of cDNA libraries. Sequencing analysis was performed using the NextSeq 500\/550 High Output v2 Kit (75 cycles) and the NextSeq 500 sequencer.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Twelve paired primary cultures were prepared to global piRNA expression profiling. Small RNA-seq bioinformatics analysis identified between 3.45 and 5.51% of unique mapped piRNA reads in all samples; GSCs expressing higher levels of piRNA molecules in comparison with paired GBM cells. Subsequently, we identified a set of significantly differentially expressed piRNAs in GSCs. Expression of selected piRNAs was then artificially regulated in primary GSCs <i>in vitro<\/i>, and the effect of these molecules on neurosphere formation, viability, and cell genome stability was analyzed. Finally, we also observed an association of piR-23231 with overall survival of GBM patients. All results will be presented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2022.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Based on the results so far, piRNAs seem to play an important role in GSCs as well as GBM biology and their targeting may be a promising tool for therapy of GBM patients.
