EC are characterized by frequent defective DNA repair, along with alterations of PI3K-AKT-mTor, and IGF1R pathways. In preclinical studies, the activity of PARP inhibitor is increased by the inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway. Metformin inhibits the PI3K-AKT-mTor signaling pathway, and reduces IGF1 circulating levels. Metronomic cyclophosphamide may increase the activity of PARP inhibitors through DNA alkylating and anti-angiogenic effects. ENDOLA trial was meant to assess the safety and efficacy of the triplet olaparib (PARP 1-3 inhibitor) + metronomic cyclophosphamide + metformin in patients with advanced EC<br \/>Methods: ENDOLA trial (NCT02755844) was an academic French prospective multicenter phase I\/II open-label dose-escalation study meant to assess the safety, the Recommended Phase II trial Dose (RP2D), and the efficacy of olaparib combined to metronomic cyclophosphamide 50 mg PO QD and metformin 500 mg PO TID in patients with recurrent advanced EC. In the phase I part, olaparib was dose-escalated from PO 150 mg to 300 mg BID with a continual reassessment method (CRM), aiming at defining the RP2D. In the phase II part, the cohort was expanded to assess the efficacy of the triplet in terms of non-progression rate at 10 weeks (H0= 20%; H1= 50%; 1-sided &#945; risk=0.01; power = 90%).<br \/>Results: From Sept 2016 to Nov 2019, 35 patients enrolled, and 31 were assessable (median age: 69, IQR: 62-72; endometrioid: n=18 (51.4%); serous: n=11 (35.5%); carcinosarcoma: n=2 (6.5%)). In the phase I part (17 patients), 1 DLT (5.9%) was observed: grade 3 fatigue during cycle 1 at 150 mg. Dose-escalation was possible up to 300 mg BID, that was the RP2D. In the phase II part (14 patients), the overall response rate was 20.8%, and the disease-control rate was 66.6 %. The non-progression rate at 10 weeks was 61.5% (95% CI 42.8-80.2). The median PFS was 5.1 months, including 7.5 months (5.1-8.9) for endometrioid, and 4.3 months (2.7-5.8) for serous carcinomas. Treatment-related serious adverse-events (AEs) occurred in 3 patients (grade 3 fatigue; grade 4 lymphopenia; grade 4 lymphopenia &#38; neutropenia). The most frequent grade 3-4 treatment-related AEs were lymphopenia (32.3%); anemia (16.1%); neutropenia (16.1%); and fatigue (12.9%).<br \/>Conclusions: In heavily pre-treated patients with advanced EC, olaparib 300 mg BID could be safely combined to metformin 1500 mg\/day and metronomic cyclophosphamide 50 mg\/day. With a 61.5% non-progression rate at 10 weeks, the 1<sup>st<\/sup>-objective was reached. The 5.1 month median PFS (7.5 for endometrioid and 4.3 for serous) is promising compared to those observed with chemotherapy or immunotherapy-based combination in KEYNOTE-775 (Colombo et al. Proc ESMO 2021). Investigation in phase III is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,PARP inhibitors,Phase I,Metformin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benoit You<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Leary<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuel Rodrigues<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Follana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cyril Abdeddaim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florence Joly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvie Bin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurent Villeneuve<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marine Alexandre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florent Boutitie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Delphine Maucort-Boulch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Verane Schwiertz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gilles Freyer<\/i><\/presenter>.

Elimusertib is a selective ATR inhibitor with promising antitumor activity in pts with advanced solid tumors with ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein loss and\/or <i>ATM<\/i> putative deleterious alterations (Yap et al. <i>Cancer Discov<\/i> 2021). We report here the safety and efficacy of elimusertib in expansion cohorts of pts with a range of cancer types and DDR deficiencies and\/or ATM loss. We also explored an alternative dose schedule in pts with ATM aberrations.<br \/>Methods: Pts with advanced solid tumors resistant or refractory to standard treatment were screened for pathogenic DDR defects by next-generation sequencing or ATM protein loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of baseline tumor tissue. Pts were assigned to cohorts: colorectal cancer (CRC); castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC); HER2<sup>&#8722;<\/sup> breast cancer (BC); gynecologic (GYN, mainly ovarian and endometrial); and advanced cancers with ATM IHC loss. Pts were treated with elimusertib 40 mg twice daily (BID) 3 days on\/4 days off (3 on\/4 off). A schedule of 3 on\/11 off was also explored by dose escalation in pts with ATM loss or inactivating mutation.<br \/>Results: 143 pts received &#8805;1 dose of elimusertib 40 mg BID 3 on\/4 off, including 24 CRC, 19 CRPC, 19 BC, 45 GYN, and 36 ATM loss. 56% of pts had &#8805;4 prior therapy lines. Drug-related grade 3 and 4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 69% and 15% of pts, respectively, mainly anemia, leukopenia\/neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia leading to dose modification but not withdrawal. 32 pts were treated 3 on\/11 off with doses from 60 to 120 mg BID. Compared with 3 on\/4 off, drug-related grade &#8805;3 hematologic TEAEs and dose modifications improved at lower doses, with 80 mg 3 on\/11 off determined as the recommended dose. In pts receiving elimusertib 3 on\/4 off, 5 RECIST partial responses were observed: 1 in ovarian (<i>BRCA1<\/i> heterozygous mutation), 1 in BC (<i>BRCA2<\/i> mutation), and 3 in ATM IHC loss: 2 CRPC pts both with ATM mutations (1 heterozygous, 1 homozygous), including 1 with <i>FANCA<\/i> mutation; 1 esophageal with ATM mutation. In pts with ATM IHC loss, objective response rate (ORR) was 9% and disease control rate (DCR) was 65%. A similar ORR was seen on 3 on\/11 off in pts with ATM aberrations. In GYN pts, ORR was 2.3% and DCR was 73%.<br \/>Conclusions: Elimusertib monotherapy demonstrated clinical activity in pts with DDR defects. Overall safety was manageable and hematologic toxicity improved on the 3 on\/11 off schedule. Further biomarker analysis is underway to identify potential gene signatures associated with response. Clinical development of elimusertib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy is ongoing (NCT04095273, NCT04514497).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATR,Phase I,DNA damage response,ATM,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy A.

This is the first report of the ongoing Phase 1\/2a PETRA (NCT04644068) trial.<br \/>Methods: Pts with advanced breast, ovarian, prostate or pancreatic cancer bearing germline or somatic <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>, <i>PALB2<\/i> or <i>RAD51C\/D<\/i> mutations received AZD5305 QD PO until disease progression. ECOG PS 0-2 and Hb &#8805;9.0 g\/dL were required. Prior PARPi and platinum therapy were permitted. The primary objective was safety; secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics in tumor and\/or blood samples and response by RECIST v1.1, CA125 or PSA. Exploratory genomic analyses included zygosity evaluation and ctDNA response monitoring.<br \/>Results: At data cutoff (Nov 17, 2021), 46 pts received AZD5305 10-90 mg QD (43.5% had prior PARPi; median 3.5 prior lines of therapy). AZD5305 was well tolerated across all doses without DLTs (Table). PK exposures were dose-proportional. Steady-state C<sub>trough<\/sub> was higher than 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation PARPi: specifically 6.3 and 31.9 fold above target effective concentration at 10 and 90 mg, respectively. PARylation inhibition was &#8805;90% at 10-40 mg QD (PBMCs) confirming target engagement. 7\/25 (28%) pts had objective responses: 5 RECIST PRs (3 confirmed) and 2 additional pts with PSA<sub>50<\/sub> responses (1 confirmed), including platinum- and PARPi-resistant pts. 13\/22 (59%) RECIST-measurable pts had SD or PR up to 51+ weeks. ctDNA declined on treatment in 7\/13 (54%) evaluable pts (3 complete, 4 &#62;50% reductions) across doses.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>AZD5305 is a highly selective PARP1 inhibitor and trapper with excellent physiochemical properties and a wide therapeutic index. It led to maximal target engagement and showed promising clinical activity with favorable tolerability at exposures surpassing those of 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation PARPi.<b> <\/b><table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{0F4D7EEB-1542-48E6-925A-5C55A348E9B3}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>AZD5305 10 mg\/d (n=8)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>AZD5305 20 mg\/d (n=19)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>AZD5305 40 mg\/d (n=13)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>AZD5305 60 mg\/d (n=3)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>AZD5305 90 mg\/d (n=3)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>Total (N=46)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Most common (&#62;10%) TRAEs, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Any grade<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Any grade<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Any grade<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Any grade<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Any grade<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Grade &#8805;3<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Any grade<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We will report the longest follow-up for a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor, including 2-year survival, safety, and genomic profiles associated with durable clinical benefit.<br \/>Methods: Sotorasib was administered orally at 960 mg once daily to patients who progressed on prior therapies and had <i>KRAS<\/i> p.G12C-mutated locally advanced, metastatic NSCLC. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by central review. Key secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. In an exploratory analysis, baseline tumor tissue and\/or plasma samples were collected and analyzed for genomic alterations. Tumor samples were analyzed for PD-L1 levels to evaluate correlates with prolonged tumor response, defined as patients with PFS &#8805; 12 months, in comparison with those with PFS &#8804; 3 months.<br \/>Results: In the first analysis of the combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 study (N=174), the median number of prior lines of therapy was 2.0 (range 1-4+). 90.2% received prior anti-PD1 or anti PD-L1 treatment; 82.8% received both prior platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD1\/PD-L1. Updated ORR by central review was 40.7% (95% CI: 33.2, 48.4) and median DOR was 12.3 months (7.1, 14.6). Median PFS and OS was 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.3, 8.2) and 12.5 months (10.0, 17.8). One and two-year OS was 50.8% and 30.3%. Sotorasib was well-tolerated in the long-term with mild and manageable toxicities, and no new safety signals emerged. Prolonged tumor response was observed across PD-L1 expression, including in tumors with low PDL-1 expression and<i> STK11<\/i> co-mutation that may derive less benefit from immunotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: In the longest follow-up of any KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor, sotorasib continued to demonstrate a favorable safety profile and durable efficacy, including a 2-year OS observed in 30% of patients. Current analyses continue to support long-term clinical benefit across subgroups in patients with <i>KRAS<\/i> p.G12C-mutated NSCLC, and additional biomarker data will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL02-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,KRAS G12C inhibitor,sotorasib,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Grace K.
