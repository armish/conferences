[{"Abstract":"Background: <i>ALK2<\/i> is mutated in several cancers, including melanoma and endometrial, colorectal, bladder, and breast cancers. TP-0184 is an orally delivered ALK2 inhibitor, part of the transforming growth factor beta receptor superfamily of serine\/threonine kinases, expected to reduce tumor growth in ALK2-dependent cancers. Safety, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor activity from a phase 1 study of TP-0184 in pts with ASTs (NCT03429218) are presented.<br \/>Methods: Pts with metastatic\/progressive ASTs refractory to\/intolerant of established therapy received oral TP-0184. Escalating doses were evaluated via a 3+3 design, starting with 30 mg\/day (d) for 21\/28 d. However, preliminary time-to-steady-state PK data (data cutoff: March 31, 2021) suggested a half-life of ~3-5 d. Given the estimated longer half-life (compared to available preclinical data), the protocol was amended to a dose of 60 mg once a wk (QW) for 4 wks. All pts continued on the same regimen until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives: maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary objectives: PK, antitumor activity, and recommended phase 2 dose.<br \/>Results: At data cutoff (May 27, 2021), 24 pts were treated. Mean age was 63.1 (range 34.1-83.4) y, 83.3% were female, and 75.0% had an ECOG PS of 1. Most common tumor types (&#8805;2 pts) were colorectal (n=5); pancreatic (n=3); and lung, ovarian, and peritoneal (n=2 each). Dose escalation reached 125 mg QW (not expanded due to lack of meaningful antitumor response at 125 mg QW and study closure). No pt experienced a DLT; MTD was not reached. All pts experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), most commonly nausea (50%); 14 (58.3%) pts experienced a Grade 3-4 TEAE, most commonly anemia (n=3); abdominal pain, pulmonary embolism, nausea, and vomiting (n=2 each). Eight (33.3%) pts experienced a serious adverse event and 1 pt in the 60-mg QD group died during study due to disease progression, considered unrelated to treatment. Best response was stable disease in 7 (30.4%) and progressive disease in 15 (65.2%) pts; not done (n=1, 4.3%). No partial responses were observed. Preliminary PK data (data cutoff: March 31, 2021) from the weekly dosing cohorts indicated dose-related increases in exposure (maximum concentration [C<sub>max<\/sub>]) from 60 mg (Day [D] 1=20.9 [standard deviation (SD) 12.9] ng\/mL; D21=32.3 [SD 26.9] ng\/mL) to 125 mg (D1=45.3 [SD 27.8] ng\/mL; D21=144.0 ng\/mL [SD not available]), except for a decrease in mean C<sub>max<\/sub> on D1 from 90 mg to 125 mg (data not shown). Drug accumulation was observed with QW dosing but to a lesser extent than daily dosing.<br \/>Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that TP-0184 is tolerated as monotherapy at doses up to 125 mg QW; MTD was not reached. A study in pts with myelodysplastic syndromes is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b42882f0-8f2d-4eb2-bd21-2955ea82ac09\/@D03B8ZYa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Advanced cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20178"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joaquina Baranda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael S.

A Phase 1\/2 study (NCT 04731467) includes in its Phase 1 part, a dose escalation of CM24 administered with nivolumab for the treatment of refractory cancer patients. The primary objectives of this part are to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CM24. In the Phase 2 part of this study, patients with NSCLC relapsed from or refractory to first-line immuno-oncology will be treated with CM24 and nivolumab, and patients with advanced\/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma relapsed from or refractory to first-line therapy will be treated with CM24, nivolumab, and chemotherapy, the objective will be to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination treatment.<br \/>Methods: In the dose escalation part of the study, enrolled patients were administered with CM24 at 10, 15 and 20mg\/kg q2w and nivolumab 480mg q4w. Safety was assessed according to CTCAE v5 and preliminary anti-tumor activity was assessed by the investigators according to RECISTv1.1 using CT\/MRI. CM24 and CEACAM1 measurements in serum, biopsy specimens and TILs, as well as tumor and TILs PD-L1 levels were determined.<br \/>Results: As of data cutoff date of January 31, 2022, a total of 13 patients were in the dose escalation phase, of which 10 are evaluable for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) determination, including 7 with pancreatic cancer (PDAC), 2 with colorectal cancer (CRC) and one with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). All patients but one had received 2 prior regimens for metastatic disease. Six Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) (unrelated to CM24 or nivolumab), were observed, each in a single patient, including diarrhea, hypokalemia, abdominal pain, small bowel obstruction, atrial flutter, and GI bleed. No Grade 4 AEs or deaths were reported. For the 10 evaluable patients, best overall response included one confirmed PR (PDAC patient, 6-month duration of response) two SD (one PDAC and one PTC patient, both with duration of 3.5 months), and two patients are awaiting follow up MRI\/CT scans. As of the cutoff date, 8\/10 of the patients that completed the DLT period are on treatment or in follow up (range 2 to 9.5 months). Pharmacokinetic analysis of CM24 shows exposure is dose-related and approximately dose-proportional. Dose proportionality is shown by CLss and dose normalized Cmax and AUC. Receptor occupancy analyses in peripheral blood reached a mean of 100% occupancy of CEACAM1 by CM24 at the higher dose levels.<br \/>Conclusion: The Phase 2 portions of the study will be initiated at the conclusion of this dose escalation part.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6b8dc80b-9fae-489d-9fa5-1e58577a4793\/@D03B8ZYa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL01-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Monoclonal antibodies,Tumor microenvironment,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20180"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erkut Borazanci<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammed Najeeb Al Hallak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph P.

AS-1763 is a potent, highly selective, orally active, non-covalent inhibitor of both wild-type and C481S-mutant BTK. AS-1763 strongly inhibits the proliferation of B cell lymphoma cell line OCI-LY10 carrying wild-type and C481S-mutatant BTK <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. AS-1763, therefore, is expected to be a promising BTK inhibitor for patients who have failed or are intolerant to a covalent BTK inhibitor. This study reports the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) in healthy volunteers who received single, ascending doses of AS-1763 in an alternating cohort design.<br \/>Methods: This is a first-in-human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single-center, single-ascending dose Phase I study of AS-1763. Two cohorts of 8 healthy male and female subjects were alternately dosed with AS-1763 (5, 25, 100, 300, 500, and 600 mg) or placebo orally under fasted condition. Intensive blood sampling for PK (up to 72 h) and PD (up to 24 h) was conducted before and post-dosing to allow a successful PK\/PD correlation. For the PD assessment, whole blood was stimulated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with an anti-IgD antibody, and CD69 upregulation on B cells was assessed by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: Single doses of up to 600 mg AS-1763 were well-tolerated. No serious adverse events (AE) were reported during the trial. All treatment-emerged AEs reported were of mild intensity and showed no apparent dose-relationship in frequency. No clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed in all other safety parameters assessed (clinical laboratory, ECGs, vital signs, or physical examinations). AS-1763 was rapidly absorbed with a median time to maximum plasma concentrations (t<sub>max<\/sub>) of 0.5-2.0 h post-dose and thereafter gradually decreased with mean elimination half-time (t<sub>1\/2<\/sub>) of 8.5-12 h. Overall, mean plasma concentrations of AS-1763 increased with dose up to 500 mg. AS-1763 at 100 mg or higher induced &#62;80% inhibition of B cell activation (%CD69 upregulation in na&#239;ve B cells normalized to baseline) at 1-2 h post-dose and the duration of inhibitory effect increased with dose. PK\/PD analysis demonstrated that the IC<sub>50<\/sub> and IC<sub>90<\/sub> (90% CI) values for inhibition of CD69 upregulation in na&#239;ve B cells were 10.5 ng\/mL (9.7-11.2 ng\/mL) and 34.6 ng\/mL (28.8-40.4 ng\/mL), respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Single doses of AS-1763 up to 600 mg were well-tolerated and showed encouraging pharmacodynamics (inhibition of CD69 upregulation) with a favorable safety profile. The data support continued development of AS-1763 for patients with B-cell malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e9c766d1-1770-4083-abf0-5bca8b75e5c5\/@D03B8ZYa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BTK,AS-1763,Pharmacodynamics,CD69,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20181"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akinori Arimura<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyoko Miyamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Velinova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marieke Van den Dobbelsteen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katsuhiro Mihara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert M.

Pirtobrutinib is an oral, highly selective, non-covalent (reversible) BTKi with promising efficacy and safety in heavily pretreated relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) CLL pts, regardless of BTK C481 mutation status. Recent clinical studies reported on the safety and efficacy of time-limited venetoclax and covalent BTKi combination regimens. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of pirtobrutinib combined with venetoclax &#177; rituximab in pts with R\/R CLL.<br \/>Methods: BRUIN is a phase 1\/2 global, multicenter study (NCT03740529) of pirtobrutinib in pts with advanced B-cell malignancies. The phase 1b portion evaluated the safety of pirtobrutinib at a continuous dose of 200 mg QD from Cycle 1, Day 1 plus venetoclax starting on Cycle 2, Day 1 with a standard 5-week dose ramp to 400 mg QD (PV) and PV plus rituximab at 375 mg\/m2 on Cycle 1, Day 1, then 500 mg\/m2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6 (PVR). Prior BTKi was allowed; prior venetoclax was not permitted. Objectives included safety and overall response rate (ORR) of each combination.<br \/>Results: As of 27 SEP 2021, 15 pts received PV and 10 pts received PVR. Median age was 66 years (range, 39-78). Median prior lines of therapy was 2 (range, 1-4). The majority of pts in both cohorts had received prior chemotherapy (56%, n=14), CD20 monoclonal antibody (72%, n=18), and\/or covalent BTKi (68%, n=17). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Safety profiles were generally similar across both cohorts. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) of any grade, regardless of attribution, were neutrophil count decrease (36%), nausea (32%), fatigue (32%), diarrhea (28%), and constipation (24%). The only Grade &#8805;3 TEAE to occur in more than 2 pts was neutrophil count decrease (36%, n=9). One pt experienced Grade 4 clinical tumor lysis syndrome with resultant acute kidney injury during venetoclax dose escalation, which resolved with supportive measures. No pts discontinued treatment due to AEs. For the 22 pts with efficacy data available as of 03 NOV 2021, median duration of follow-up was 9 months (range, 3.9-15) and the ORR was 95.5% (95% CI, 77-100). All responding pts except 1 remain on therapy (PVR responder discontinued due to death unrelated to study treatment). As all responses were ongoing and early, and MRD analysis was not yet performed.<br \/>Conclusions: Pirtobrutinib combined with venetoclax &#177; rituximab was well tolerated and had a safety profile consistent with known drug class findings and no clear additive toxicities in pts with R\/R CLL. Early results demonstrate promising efficacy with combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55189848-cfcf-4ed2-8663-b2ec12327d60\/@D03B8ZYa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: chronic lymphocytic,BTK,Combination therapy,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20182"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lindsey E.

The Comparative In Vivo Oncology (CIVO) platform was developed as a means to assess the effect of investigational agents on the native TME in a Phase 0 microdosing study. CIVO was clinically validated using approved agents and is used for the first time here to assess the impact of an investigational agent - the SUMOylation inhibitor TAK-981 - on the native human TME in HNSCC.<br \/>Materials\/Methods: Eligible subjects have a confirmed HNSCC diagnosis, ECOG 0-2, and planned surgical resection. Injectable tumors were at the primary site or within cervical lymph nodes but had to be surface-accessible and &#8805; 2cm. TAK-981 or control microdoses were simultaneously administered via a CIVO device and co-injected with a fluorescent tracking marker for injection site identification and visualization. Tumors were resected 24 or 72 hours after injection, processed, and then analyzed at a central site. Multiplexed biomarker staining and molecular profiling via GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling were performed to capture pharmacodynamic responses in the native TME.<br \/>Results: As of January 2022, 8 subjects provided informed consent and were enrolled, and no adverse events associated with the injection procedure or microdoses have been reported. Biomarker analysis demonstrated TAK-981 distribution around the injection site accompanied by reduction of SUMOylation. Dose-dependent elevation of IFN1 signaling was also observed in TAK-981-exposed areas within the TME. Elevated IFN1 signaling was accompanied by TME reconfiguration, with increased macrophage M1 polarization and activation of dendritic cells, NK cells, and CD8+ T cells. TAK-981 exposure was also associated with upregulation of CXCL10, PD-L1, and an IFN&#947; gene expression signature predictive of response to immune checkpoint blockade.<br \/>Conclusion: IT microdosing with CIVO provided early insights into complex functional responses induced by the investigational agent TAK-981 that can only be accurately evaluated in the intact, native TME of a patient&#8217;s tumor. SUMO pathway inhibition in HNSCC tumors following TAK-981 exposure led to functional activation of multiple immune cell types, effectively shifting the local TME toward an inflamed &#8220;hot&#8221; state, highlighting TAK-981&#8217;s potential as an immune stimulating agent for treating patients with solid tumors. These data were generated while TAK-981 was still in Phase I dose escalation trials (via IV administration), highlighting CIVO&#8217;s ability to safely study investigational agents. Further evaluation of TAK-981 alone and in combination with other agents is ongoing in this Phase 0 CIVO microdosing trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a64a503-7f1c-4650-bcef-ff75d099c77a\/@D03B8ZYa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Sumoylation,Cancer immunotherapy,CIVO,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20183"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jeffrey Houlton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harrison Cash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haodong Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul L.

ANV419 comprises an antibody specific for the IL-2R&#945;-binding domain of IL-2 fused to native hIL-2 and functions as a potent, highly selective, IL-2R&#946;&#947; binding agonist. ANV419 has shown high effector selectivity and a favorable safety profile in preclinical testing, including in non-human primates, and is currently being investigated in an ongoing phase I\/II dose finding study in multiple tumor types (ANV419-001). Here we present data from the single patient cohort and the initial 3+3 cohort dose escalation. Data cut-off was December 22<sup>nd<\/sup>, 2021. Ten patients in five dose cohorts. Patients had progressed melanoma (cutaneous (n=3), uveal (n=2), mucosal (n=1), choroidal (n=1)), renal cell carcinoma(n=1), hepatocellular carcinoma (n=1) and colorectal cancer(n=1) received Q2W doses of ANV419 of 3mcg\/kg (n=1), 6mcg\/kg (n=1), 12mcg\/kg (n=1), 24mcg\/kg (n=4) and 48mcg\/kg (n=3) body weight without immunosuppressive premedication as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Patients received a mean of 4 cycles. Minimal follow up of patients completing the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period is 2 cycles. All patients experienced mild chills (Grade 1) with or without low-grade fever (Grade 1) hours after drug administration. These resolved with antipyretic treatment within hours. There were two grade 2 AEs in two patients related to ANV419. One patient developed Grade 2 CRS (hypotension grade 2 with fever (Grade 1) and chills (Grade 1) that resolved with 500ml intravenous fluid. One patient experienced transient, self-limiting Grade 2 CRS. No drug related Adverse Events &#62;Grade 2 and no DLTs were observed. One patient in the 24 mcg\/kg cohort was non evaluable and was subsequently replaced. Pharmacodynamic evaluation on day 4 post-dosing, showed a dose dependent increase of Ki-67 positivity in CD8 T cells (2%, 14%, 37%, 62%, 62% vs. baseline mean (BLM) 2%)) and NK cells (30%, 62%, 75%, 85%, 80% vs BLM 6%) but not CD4 regulatory T cells (4%, 13%, 25%, 16%, 19% vs. BLM 5%) at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 mcg\/kg doses respectively. Pharmacokinetic data show a dose proportional increase of serum concentration of ANV419. Both PK and PD were conserved over multiple cycles. Four patients continue to receive ANV419. Four patients underwent more than one follow-up imaging, all of which showed stable disease. Updated patient data will be presented during the meeting. ANV419 is very well tolerated and induces a high degree of proliferation in CD8 T cells and NK cells but not Tregs. ANV419-001 will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANV419 alone and in combination with other immunotherapy drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/195fef58-7fd1-4f40-b73a-95072d1c29d1\/@D03B8ZYa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,T cell,Regulatory T cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20184"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Elena Garralda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alonso Guzman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juanita Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vicky Sanchez-Perez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heinz Läubli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emiliano Calvo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Huber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Egli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aswathy Nair<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie Mouton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirsten Richter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlo Lanza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sangeeta Jethwa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvio Costanzo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Christoph Bucher<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Moreover, all presently available T cell-mobilizing strategies cause substantial side effects that endanger patients and limit applicable doses and thus efficacy. Here we report on the development of CC-1, a PSMAxCD3 bsAb that is constructed in a novel IgG-based format (IgGsc) and contains a proprietary PSMA binder with extended reactivity. CC-1 displays a prolonged serum half-life, especially when compared to the BiTE bsAb format. Extensive in vitro and in vivo characterization demonstrated the potency of CC-1 to induce T cell activity in a highly target cell-restricted manner, resulting in profound antitumor activity, which among others allowed for elimination of large established tumors in humanized mice (Zekri <i>et al<\/i>, EMBO 2020). Exclusively funded by public resources, we conducted GMP production of CC-1 and in November 2019 initiated a first in human trial enrolling castration resistant prostate carcinoma patients (NCT04104607). The trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation phase with intra-individual dose escalation until the target dose of 826&#181;g to determine overall safety, tolerability as well as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and a dose expansion phase, where patients are treated on the MTD level to detect possible efficacy. In August 2021, recruitment in the dose escalation phase was completed and the target dose was reached without DLT upon treatment of the 9<sup>th<\/sup> patient. A total of 14 patients were treated, with the most frequently observed toxicity being cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in 79% of patients. CRS did not exceed grade 2 according to the Lee <i>et al<\/i>. grading system (Lee <i>et al.<\/i>, 2014) and resolved in most cases without additional application of tocilizumab. Besides hypertension (observed in 50% of patients), no further CC-1 related toxicities (i.e., Xerostomia, or anaphylactic reaction) were observed. As expected, after prophylactic tocilizumab application decreased neutrophile counts and elevated liver enzymes were observed in 86% and 43% of patients, respectively. In terms of efficacy, a rapid and profound decline of elevated PSA levels was observed in all the heavily pre-treated patients, with up to 60% reduction compared to baseline. Three patients of the dose escalation phase received multiple treatment cycles at the highest dose level, based on clinical tolerability, documented induction of potent T cell activation as well as rapid and profound decline of elevated PSA levels. Taken together, CC-1 is a promising compound with a favorable toxicity profile and promising clinical activity. Recruitment in the dose expansion phase is ongoing with the respective data to be presented at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17bcaf12-aa89-478c-942b-f7c6a96e05e2\/@D03B8ZYa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Bispecific antibody,Prostate cancer,PSMA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20185"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jonas S.

GD2 is a tumor antigen expressed on neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. In initial studies, T cells expressing 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation GD2-CARTs were shown to be safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients with refractory neuroblastoma.<br \/>Methods: We developed a 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation GD2-CART (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) and conducted a phase I trial (NCT02107963) to determine the feasibility of producing and safety of administering escalating doses of GD2-CARTs in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors, including neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma, following cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion. Patient samples were evaluated for cytokine profile kinetics, immune phenotype analysis with mass cytometry (CyTOF), transcriptomic evaluation with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), epigenetic determination with Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), and functional studies with flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: 15 patients aged 8-28 years were enrolled on four dose levels, of which 13 patients were infused. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and administration of up to 1x10<sup>7<\/sup> GD2-CART\/kg was feasible and safe for children and young adults with neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. 15.4% (2\/13) of patients experienced grade-1 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and no neurological toxicity was observed. We measured the expansion and persistence of adoptively transferred GD2-CARTs in the peripheral blood. GD2-CARTs expanded in all patients receiving treatment, half of whom had expansion similar to that seen in clinically active CD19 and CD22 CARTs, but the GD2-CARTs had limited persistence. At Day 28 following GD2-CART infusion, 23.1% (3\/13) of evaluable patients had progressive disease and 76.9% (10\/13) had stable disease (SD). 3\/10 SD patients remained stable at 60 days post-GD2-CART, but all patients eventually progressed. Since a major barrier to CART efficacy is inadequate CART expansion, we comprehensively evaluated for phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic immune profiles of patient apheresis, CART product, and post-treatment peripheral blood samples to identify determinants of CART expansion. GD2-CART expansion is significantly correlated with several T cell markers, and a larger baseline na&#239;ve and central memory T cell pool. Unique myeloid populations are associated with CART expansion. ATACseq identifies epigenetic differences in pre-treatment apheresis that may predict good CAR expansion in patients.<br \/>Conclusions: GD2-CART therapy following cyclophosphamide conditioning was well tolerated at all four dose levels in pediatric and young adult patients with neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. Subsequent multi-dimensional analyses suggest key mechanisms underlying CART biology and function and highlight the potential of defining and applying molecular signatures in apheresis and CART product as biomarkers and prognostic indicators of CART expansion, with promise for advancing immunotherapies for solid tumor patients in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82876d57-b281-4671-9aab-fb0c92320670\/@D03B8ZYa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I, II, or III clinical trials in pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Pediatric cancers,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20186"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sneha Ramakrishna<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabina Kaczanowska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tara Murty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina F.

Alpha emitters have high potency over a short range whereas beta emitters have lower energy over a significantly longer range. We hypothesized that combining mAb and SML targeting plus combining alpha and beta emitters offered complementary benefits and would be safe and effective.<br \/>Methods: A series of cell line and xenograft studies were performed to test mAb vs SML vs combo binding, uptake, and efficacy. A phase I\/II clinical trial was initiated, enrolling patients with progressive, PSMA+ (by PSMA PET) mCRPC following potent AR pathway inhibition and chemotherapy (or chemo ineligible\/refused)[NCT04886986]. The primary endpoint of phase I is assessment of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) with secondary endpoints of response, progression-free and overall survival, genomic and imaging correlatives, and patient-reported outcomes.<br \/>Results: Binding studies demonstrated that mAb plus SML binding was additive rather than competitive in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cell lines. Uptake of 177Lu-mAb plus -SML in LNCaP, CWR22rv1, and PC3\/PSMA xenograft models demonstrated synergism, with 44-65% greater tumor radioactivity in combination than the sum of the individual agents. Intracellular tracking studies indicate that the mAb re-directs SML to lysosomes from recycling endosomes, maintains retention of SML in tumor cells, and, therefore, prolongs intra-tumoral radioactivity exposure. Survival was prolonged in animals receiving 225Ac-mAb plus 177Lu-SML vs either drug alone (or control). Nine men with median age 68 (range 55-87), PSA 140 (2.4-9614) have been enrolled in both of 2 planned dose-escalation cohorts. 89% with bone, 44% lymph node, 22% liver, 22% lung metastases; 88% with detectable CTC count (75% unfavorable). All had at least 1 metastatic lesion with PSMA PET SUVmax &#62; liver SUVmean, with SUVmax of the single hottest lesion ranging from 11.6-69.9. For the primary endpoint, 0 of 3 with DLT in cohort 1, and with follow up ongoing, no DLT has occurred to date in 6 patients in cohort 2. Of evaluable patients, 5 of 6 with PSA decline (8-97% decline).<br \/>Conclusions: Targeting PSMA with the combination of mAb and SML leads to synergistic radioactivity in preclinical studies. The combination on mAb and SML radiolabeled with alpha and beta emitters appears safe with short-term follow up with phase 2 enrollment planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a655ad7e-e7cb-4ee3-8b74-88830b6cf281\/@D03B8ZYa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PSMA,Prostate cancer,Radioimmunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20187"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Scott T.

Our preclinical data showed synergy between TLR3 ligands and interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;) in reprogramming the TME, but not healthy tissues, to selectively enhance CTL attraction, providing rationale for their systemic application to enhance local CTL densities in &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. The pilot study NCT03599453 evaluated the safety of systemic chemokine modulating regimen (CKM) composed of i.v. rintatolimod (Ampligen; selective TLR3 ligand) and IFN-&#945;, and its ability to promote local CTL influx to mTNBC lesions.<br \/>}Methods: Six evaluable patients (33-75 years) with mTNBC received 6 doses of rintatolimod (200 mg i.v.), IFN-&#945; (INTRON-A; 20MU\/m2 i.v.) and COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib; 2 x 200 mg, p.o.) over 2 weeks, with tumor biopsies obtained before (within 6 days) and after (within 5 days) CKM. All patients received follow-up pembrolizumab (200 mg, i.v, Q3 weeks). The primary endpoint was the change in the CTL marker CD8&#945; in the TME with a planned interim analysis after 3 patients (&#945;=0.03) and final analysis after 6 patients (&#945;=0.084). Correlative studies analyzed additional markers of CTLs, regulatory T-cells (T<sub>regs<\/sub>), and CTL- and T<sub>reg<\/sub>-attracting chemokines in the TME and blood.<br \/>Results: Treatment was well tolerated with mostly grade 1\/2 adverse events and one grade 3 clinically significant pneumonitis and immune thrombocytopenic purpura observed during follow up pembrolizumab treatment. We observed uniform increases of intratumoral type-1 immune markers upon treatment: CD8&#945; mRNA (6.1-fold; p=0.034), GZMB (3.5-fold; p=0.058), ratios of CD8&#945;\/FOXP3 and GZMB\/FOXP3 (5.7-fold; p=0.036, and 7.6-fold; p=0.024 respectively), and CTL attractants CXCL10 (2.6-fold; p=0.104) and CCL5 (3.3-fold; p=0.019), successfully meeting the primary endpoint. In contrast, neither T<sub>reg<\/sub> marker Foxp3 nor T<sub>reg<\/sub> attractants CCL22 or CXCL12 were enhanced. These TME changes were accompanied by transient decreases in circulating CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CTLs and CD3<sup>-<\/sup>CD56<sup>+<\/sup> NK cells (but not T<sub>regs<\/sub>), selectively affecting the cells expressing CXCR3<sup> <\/sup>(receptor for CXCL10), but not CCR4 or CXCR4<sup> <\/sup>(receptors for CCL22 and CXCL12). Three patients had stable disease lasting 2.4, 2.5 and 3.8 months, as of September 1, 2021 cut-off. An additional patient had a partial response (breast auto-amputation) with massive tumor necrosis observed in the post-CKM biopsy.<br \/>Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study shows that short-term systemic CKM followed by pembrolizumab is safe and selectively enhances local CTL infiltration in the TME, providing rationale for concurrent CKM and PD1 blockade in prospective phase II studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae14ba44-40de-4332-a7c0-55f8a5b98cc5\/@E03B8ZYb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20189"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shipra Gandhi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mateusz Opyrchal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Grimm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald Slomba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathleen Kokolus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastiano Battaglia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristopher Attwood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrienne Groman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Lynne Tarquini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Wallace<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kah Teong Soh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tracey O'Connor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Early<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ellis Levine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Puzanov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Ernstoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pawel Kalinski<\/i><\/presenter>.

The addition of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) CTLA-4 and PD-1 has shown increased antitumor efficacy in preclinical models, and the triplet is hypothesized to enhance anti-tumor immune response by augmenting effector cell expansion, differentiation, cytotoxic activity, and immune checkpoint inhibition. Results of the lead-in safety arms of rhIL-15\/ipilimumab (Ipi) or rhIL-15\/nivolumab (N) doublets were previously reported (O&#8217;Sullivan et al. AACR. 2019) and we now report results for the dose escalation phase of the triplet combination (NCT03388632).<br \/>Methods: This phase 1, open-label, 3+3 dose escalation trial enrolled adult patients (pts) with measurable metastatic or refractory solid tumors and ECOG performance status &#8804;2. Prior therapy with 2 of the 3 study agents was permitted. Pts were treated on three dose levels (DL 1-3) of rhIL-15 (0.5, 1, or 2 mcg\/kg\/day) administered subcutaneously on days (D)1-8 and D22-29 of a 6-week cycle for the first 4 cycles only. Nivolumab (240mg IV) was administered on D8, 22, 36 and ipilimumab (1mg\/kg IV) on D8 of every cycle. Response was assessed by RECIST 1.1. Upon progression, pts could continue for response assessment utilizing iRECIST if clinically stable and without toxicity. Treatment-induced changes in circulating and tumor T cell activation, signaling, and the PD-L1 checkpoint will be assessed with validated pharmacodynamic biomarker assays.<br \/>Results: A total of 17 pts were enrolled on the triplet dose escalation phase; 15 pts were evaluable for response and 6 pts had received prior treatment with a PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitor. Median time on treatment (MTT) was 12 weeks (range 3-101). A confirmed partial response (PR) was observed in a pt with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (MSI-H) after 3 cycles (total time on treatment 101 weeks). Across all dose levels, 7 pts (46.7%) had stable disease (SD) that prolonged their time on treatment with MTT of 20.4 weeks; 7 pts (46.7%) experienced progressive disease (PD) with MTT of 6.4 weeks. To better profile toxicity, 5 pts were replaced due to incomplete dosing of C1. Dose limiting toxicities at DL 3 (rhIL-15 at 2 mcg\/kg\/day) were photosensitivity and rash. Main drug-related adverse events included grade 4 lymphopenia (n=1) and grade 3 colitis, hyperthyroidism, hyponatremia, myocarditis, neutropenia, and photosensitivity (n=1, each). No pts discontinued therapy due to toxicity events. No deaths occurred on study.<br \/>Conclusions: The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of rhIL-15 is 1 mcg\/kg\/day when administered in combination with N+Ipi. The triplet dose expansion phase with the RP2D is currently accruing and includes biomarker studies in blood and tumor biopsies to assess the tumor microenvironment.

The primary objective is to investigate the safety and tolerability of ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy including identification of the MTD\/RP2D. Secondary endpoints include estimates of clinical activity of ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy. Treatment is given in repeated 21- or 28-day cycles with once-daily ZN-c3 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.<br \/>Results: As of the cutoff date of Oct 28, 2021, based on interim data, a total of 25 subjects (all dose levels, all chemotherapy cohorts) had measurable disease at baseline and at least 1 post-baseline radiological assessment.

Preclinical <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies have demonstrated AFM24 can induce killing of EGFR+ solid tumor cell lines, independently of EGFR mutational status; toxicology testing in cynomolgus monkeys revealed a favorable safety profile. An ongoing phase 1\/2a study (NCT04259450) is evaluating the safety, efficacy, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic responses of AFM24 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, treatment refractory solid tumors that are known to express EGFR. AFM24 is administered intravenously Q1W until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, investigator&#8217;s discretion or patient withdrawal. As of 29 Oct 2021, 29 patients (median [range] age 58 [29-81] years; number of prior therapies 4 [2-8]), predominantly with colorectal- (CRC, 16\/29; 10 KRAS mutant) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 7\/29; 6 EGFR mutant), were treated with AFM24 across six dose levels (14-480 mg flat). The median number of AFM24 doses administered was 8, range 1-29. The most frequently reported (&#8805;20% of patients) AFM24-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were infusion-related reactions (IRR, 20\/29), nausea (7\/29) and headache (6\/29). There were no on-study deaths; two patients had serious TEAEs (one Grade 3 IRR and one Grade 2 hypoxia) and five patients had transient and reversible Grade 3-4 TEAEs (two Grade 3 IRRs, one Grade 3 hypertension, three &#8805;Grade 3 lymphocytopenia) attributed to AFM24, respectively. There was one dose-limiting toxicity at 40 mg (Grade 3 IRR). Best objective response was stable disease in 8\/24 response-evaluable patients; three patients had stable disease for &#8805;4 months (two CRC, one NSCLC). Dose&#8209;proportional PK between 320 and 480 mg indicated saturation of target-mediated elimination. CD16A receptor occupancy (CD16ARO) on circulating blood cells was correlated with exposure and seemed to level off at 480 mg. Estimated intra-tumoral AFM24 concentrations and CD16ARO were in the range associated with maximum tumor cell killing <i>in vitro<\/i>. TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#947; and IL-10 increased over time; other cytokines including IL-6 showed only transient increases. AFM24 has a well-managed safety profile and shows pharmacodynamic activity at doses of 320-480 mg. In parallel to continued dose escalation, expansion in disease specific cohorts has been launched at 480 mg. Other studies are evaluating AFM24 in combination with atezolizumab, and in combination with autologous NK cells holding the potential to activate the innate immune response to fight EGFR+ cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ac17c4ce-fa29-4e17-9876-ea75736e3241\/@E03B8ZYb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,EGFR,Solid tumors,Innate Cell Engager,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20193"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anthony El-Khoueiry<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juanita Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omar Saavedra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Awad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Crescens Tiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Garralda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bettina Rehbein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriele Hintzen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerstin Pietzko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christa Raab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erich Rajkovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paulien Ravenstijn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Emig<\/i><\/presenter>.

MT-6402 also delivers an HLA-A*02 restricted pp65 cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen into PD-L1 expressing tumor cells leading to MHC-I presentation to existing CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells (antigen seeding). MT-6402 functions by targeting tumor and inhibitory immune cells directly and altering tumor immunophenotype to re-direct antiviral cytotoxic T cells into the tumor microenvironment. MT-6402 shows picomolar cytotoxic activity across several PD-L1 expressing cancer cell lines and treatment of human PBMCs results in selective depletion of PD-L1 positive cells. MT-6402 was well tolerated in non-human primates at doses above those which induce pharmacodynamic (PD) effect (reduction of CD14+ monocytes) in humans.<br \/>This first-in-human study in patients with PD-L1-expressing advanced solid tumors will employ a modified toxicity probability interval design to determine MTD and will then enroll additional subjects at the MTD, to further explore safety and efficacy and determine RP2D. Results of the first dose cohort (16 micrograms\/kg) are presented.<br \/>Six patients received MT-6402. A significant and sustained reduction in CD14+ monocytes starting in cycle 2 was observed in patients on therapy beyond one cycle and was maintained with each MT-6402 administration, indicating HLA-independent PD effect consistent with preclinical observations. One HLA-A*02 and CMV+ patient with osseous metastases from NSCLC showed marked CMV-specific T-cell extravasation at day 8 and serum cytokine signatures consistent with antigen dependent responses and T cell mobilizations, suggesting engagement of MT-6402 antigen seeding. This patient has reduced intensity of metastatic bone lesions with 3\/4 lesions resolving; the remaining lesion showing reduced uptake. Two patients had cytokine elevations at day 15, manifested by transient (1-12h), grade 2 infusion-related reactions and grade 2 cytokine release syndrome, which were subsequently prevented by steroid premedication. These results describe a novel approach to checkpoint modulation, leveraging direct PD-L1 cell kill and antigen seeding technology by the ETB. The results support further dose escalation and hold promise for development of MT-6402 for solid tumors, including in the R\/R setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/abd889fb-dbea-48a0-b828-980518a866e4\/@E03B8ZYb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,PD-L1,Drug design,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20218"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David R.

Adoptive T-cell therapies (ACT) have resulted in durable clinical responses in some patients, but many are resistant. Resistance may be due to multiple factors including antigen heterogeneity or loss, immune editing, exhausted immune responses or naturally occurring immune suppressive T-cell responses. Tumors can also express Inhibigens&#8482;, antigenic targets of suppressive T cells, which may be inadvertently expanded in the non-specific ACT manufacturing process. In animal models, Inhibigen-specific responses drive tumor hyperprogression. GEN-011, a neoantigen-targeted, autologous peripheral T cell (NPT) therapy, contains tumor-specific T cells with broad neoantigen specificity. Patients undergo sequencing of tumor from fixed tissue and selection of neoantigens by<i> <\/i>ATLAS&#8482;, an <i>ex vivo<\/i> assay that directly identifies immunogenic neoantigens for use in manufacturing NPTs, and also Inhibigens for exclusion. The patient&#8217;s peripheral T cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells are incorporated into the proprietary PLANET&#8482; manufacturing process where they are specifically stimulated with up to 30 ATLAS-confirmed neoantigens in a scalable, closed system. The TiTAN clinical trial is testing a low dose regimen of GEN-011 without lymphodepletion and a single dose of GEN-011 with lymphodepletion and IL-2. To date, 19 patients with assorted solid tumors have been screened with ATLAS, prioritizing an average of 12 neoantigens (range 0-43) and excluding 14 Inhibigens (range 1-55) per patient. Of the 10 patients entering PLANET, 100% have successfully yielded a released drug product. To date, 5 patients with NSCLC or SCCHN have been dosed with escalating cell numbers and lymphodepletion\/IL-2 regimens without DLT. Early data show effector and central memory T-cell proliferation by day 5 post infusion, which peak between days 8 and 15. Neoantigen-specific T cells remain detectable in the peripheral blood for at least 36 days. Early best response from 4 evaluable patients are one PD and one mixed response in the low dose cohort, and in the more intense regimen a SD with reduction in tumor with resolution of pain and neuropathy extending for 2 months, and the fourth had stable disease. Maximum grade 2 CRS and one grade 2 ICANS peaked around day 8 in parallel to cell expansion and no patients required tocilizumab or corticosteroids. Upcoming patients will receive more intensive lymphodepletion and then higher dose IL-2. Taken together, these early data support the biological activity of GEN-011. Using a personalized immune assay to identify neoantigens, and to exclude Inhibigens, to generate tumor specific T cells may offer a more accessible and promising ACT for treating solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/66cd7ec7-938c-4e51-ae08-55366e114440\/@E03B8ZYb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Solid tumors,T cell,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20220"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maura Gillison<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiaxin Niu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Olson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Stein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Aggen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Utkarsh Acharya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Creelan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Hernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Price<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin J.

RP2 is in clinical development in a range of solid tumors alone and with nivolumab (nivo). RP2 + nivo has resulted in deep and durable responses in patients who failed prior anti-PD1 therapy (SITC 2021). Here we present biomarker data in patients treated with RP2 alone or combined with nivo from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT04336241).<br \/>Methods: Tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected pre-treatment and at D43. The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) was analyzed by multi-plex (7 color 6-plex - CD8, PD-L1, PD-1, foxp3, CD68 and S100B) immunohistochemistry (IHC) of tumor biopsies using the Opal Human Panel (OHP) 6043 and by gene expression analysis using the NanoString IO360 panel. The tumor inflammation signature score (TIS) was also calculated using an 18 gene signature (Ayers JCI 2017) . Systemic anti-tumor immunity was assessed using PBMCs by sequencing the CDR3 regions of TCR&#946; chains using immunoSEQ Assay. Correlation analysis of baseline tumor PD-L1 and CD8 status versus clinical responses was also performed.<br \/>Results: IHC indicated robust increases in CD8 T cell influx and PD-L1 expression post-RP2 alone and with RP2 + nivo. An increase in the CD8\/foxp3+ cell ratio was observed by multi-plex IHC. A consistent increase in CD8 and PD-L1 was observed in most of the tested biopsies (~70%), which generally appeared to be co-located (n=20). These increases in CD8 and PD-L1 expression levels were observed in both superficial and visceral tumors. A particularly striking change was observed in a biopsy obtained from a liver lesion from a tebantafusp and ipi\/pembro-failed uveal melanoma patient. Clinical responses were independent of baseline CD8 T cell infiltration, PD-L1 expression levels, and prior anti-PD-1 therapy status. Gene expression analysis of tumor biopsies (n=12) indicated increases in the expression of key genes associated with immune activation, particularly those associated with dendritic cell function, major histocompatibility complex-II and interferon-gamma signature. Increases in expression of genes associated with ARG1, cytotoxicity, IDO1, NK cell and Th1 cell abundance were observed, particularly in responding patients. TCR sequencing of PBMCs revealed expansion of pre-existing T cell clones and the appearance of new clones post-RP2 monotherapy and RP2 + nivo, with ~50% of these changes being newly detected clones. Expansion of pre-existing clones and generation of new T cell clones specific for MART-1 was also observed with RP2 monotherapy and in combination.<br \/>Conclusion: The biomarker data presented indicates broad immune activation by RP2 and demonstrates that clinical response does not correlate with baseline PD-L1 and CD8 expression status. Clinical responses were often associated with increases in gene signatures associated with cytotoxic T, NK and Th1 cells. These data indicate the potential for broad utility of RP2 in a range of tumor types, including in patients with primary or acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3fcad5ab-4d36-4a76-9815-0c8ca02b2df6\/@E03B8ZYb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Nivolumab,Biomarkers,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20466"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kevin J.

Recently, the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) was identified in preclinical models as a potential drug target that inhibits pro-migratory tumor progression in breast cancer by blocking tumor motility and subsequent tumor cell spread. Leronlimab (PRO140), a humanized IgG4&#954; monoclonal antibody, is a competitive inhibitor of CCR5, with 3 active clinical trials ongoing in TNBC patients. Here we report on a preliminary pooled analysis of n=28 mTNBC patients to evaluate effects of Leronlimab on circulating tumor-associated cells (TACs) found in peripheral blood as an early predictor of drug response, with end point outcomes of progression free survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS).<br \/>Methods: Blood samples were drawn from mTNBC patients from 3 blinded prospective clinical drug studies, Phase 1b\/2 (NCT03838367), Compassionate Use (NCT04313075), and Basket Study (NCT04504942) to evaluate the predictive value of TACs, measured by the LifeTracDx assay. All subjects received &#8805;1 dose of Leronlimab (range 1-33 doses), ranging from 350mg - 700mg, with 4 subjects having dose escalation. Anonymized blinded peripheral blood samples were available from (n=28) patients, obtained as part of the exploratory portion of the trials, prior to drug induction (BL) and after one treatment cycle (T1), ~26 days. TACs, i.e. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and Cancer Associated Macrophage-like cells (CAMLS), were isolated using a low-flow CellSieve microfiltration system and changes in TACs were quantified by the LifeTracDx assay. A univariate analysis was used to analyze changes in TACs to predict for PFS and OS over 12 months.<br \/>Results: A total of 28 mTNBC patients were pooled from Phase 1b\/2 (n=10), Compassionate Use (n =16), and Basket Study (n=2) all of which had available BL blood samples, or T1 samples. CTCs were found in 29% (n=8\/28) of patients at BL, and CAMLs were found in 96% (n=27\/28). Evaluating CTC change was limited, as only 5 patients had any CTC increase, although the absence or drop of CTCs at T1 was significant for better PFS (HR=13.7 CI 95% 2.0-93.8, p=0.0296) and better OS (HR=397.7 CI 95% 19.3-100+, p=0.0019). By comparison, CAMLs or CTCs were evaluable in 100% of patients, with an increases of either population at T1 also significantly predicting for worse PFS (HR=5.8 CI 95% 1.4-23.6, p=0.0354) and worse OS (HR=36.0 CI 95% 6.2-207.6, p=0.0004).<br \/>Conclusions: We observed that treatment with Leronlimab resulted in rapid decreases in the presence of multiple populations of TACs in 75% of patients, which also significantly correlated with better PFS and OS after 1 year analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/45c2f9d3-b148-48d5-8a31-00eb31e68470\/@E03B8ZYb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tumor associated macrophages,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20627"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Daniel L.
