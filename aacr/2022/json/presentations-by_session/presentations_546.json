[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>In the absence of a current standard of care, precision oncology with next-generation sequencing provides an important therapeutic option for patients with rare malignancy. Here, we sought to establish the clinical relevancy of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) for patients with rare malignancy.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Methods: <\/b>We reviewed 341 patients who underwent CGP (FoundationOne CDx; OncoGuide NCC OncoPanel System)in our institution between 2019 and 2021. Cases were classified as common or rare malignancy based on the Rare Cancers in Europe (RARECARE) definition (incidence of &#60;6 cases per 100,000 individuals). We analyzed the genomic features in the rare malignancy cohort, including gene mutations, gene fusions, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) status. Gene variants, amplifications, and fusions categorized as evidence level A using Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) and MD Anderson Knowledge Base for Precision Oncology were considered as druggable alterations. CGP testing was used to calculate overall survival (OS) to death or at the last follow-up.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> With the exception of 7 unclassifiable cases, rare malignancy accounted for 149 of the 334 cases (45%), with the most common being female genital cancers (32%), followed by digestive cancers (24%), sarcoma (16%), and others (28%). Many (83%) of the patients with rare malignancy harbored at least one pathogenic\/likely-pathogenic variant. The commonly mutated genes were <i>TP53<\/i> (41%), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (20%), <i>ARID1A<\/i> (14%), and <i>KRAS<\/i> (13%). <i>ERBB2<\/i>amplification was detected in 6% of patients (median copy number, 8). Gene fusion in <i>EWSR1<\/i> was found in 4% of patients (sarcoma) and in <i>FGFR2 <\/i>in 1% (cholangiocarcinoma and salivary duct carcinoma). TMB-high (&#8805;10 mut\/Mb) and MSI-high cases were found in 8% and 2% of cases, respectively. Druggable alterations were detected in 36 patients; this percentage was not significantly different to that of common malignancy (24% vs. 17%, <i>P<\/i>=0.10). The common druggable alterations were <i>BRAF<\/i> V600E (<i>n<\/i>=10), <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification (<i>n<\/i>=9), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> E542K (<i>n<\/i>=6), and <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> variant (<i>n<\/i>=6). There was no significant difference in OS between the rare and common malignancy groups (1-year OS rate: 62% vs. 46%, <i>P<\/i>=0.24).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In this study, the ratio of rare malignancy was higher than that typically found in previous epidemiological studies (about 20%-25%). We observed no adverse impact for OS, which might be due to the high number of patients (<i>n<\/i>=48) with intractable pancreatic cancer. Remarkably, &#62;20% of patients harbored a potential druggable alteration. Our results suggest the clinical relevance of CGP for patients with rare malignancy, and its potential utility to provide clues for future clinical development.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f2e49de-2402-4dd8-9235-16be43f4bff1\/@y03B8ZSN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome,Mutations,Gene profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17851"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akihiro Ohmoto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naomi Hayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ippei Fukada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masumi Yamazaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mayu Yunokawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akiyoshi Kasuga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eiji Shinozaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arisa Ueki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akiko Tonooka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kengo Takeuchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seiichi Mori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuma Kiyotani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunji Takahashi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Importantly, such an approach provides the end-to-end solutions that shall significantly contribute to clinical translation and\/or back translation strategies for innovative cancer therapies.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We systemically interrogated FoundationInsights&#174;, a dataset of real-world molecular genomic tumor profiling from North American patients, and investigated the prevalence of <i>MET<\/i> amplifications, <i>MET<\/i>ex14 skipping and <i>MET<\/i> fusions prevalence in 62110 unique patient samples across five indications (lung adenocarcinoma [LUAD], esophageal\/gastroesophageal-junction\/stomach adenocarcinoma [Eso\/GEJ\/Sto], papillary renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] and glioblastoma). <i>MET<\/i> alteration prevalence was further categorized based on tumor cell PD-L1 IHC status (22C3 pharmDx) and TMB status. Additionally, comprehensive text mining from clinicaltrials.gov and landscape overview were conducted.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> <i>MET<\/i> amplification was the most frequent <i>MET<\/i> alteration examined with a prevalence ranging from 1.4% in HCC to 4.8% in Eso\/GEJ\/Sto.

The heterogeneity and apparent adaptability of the HGSC genome under selective pressure by chemotherapy likely explain the high rates of drug resistance in HGSC. However, the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance are not well understood. Following our previous findings of significant distinct molecular and cellular characteristics in pre-treatment tumor samples from highly clinically annotated HGSC patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), we examined post-treatment transcriptomic changes associated with excellent or poor responders to NACT in HGSC patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Thirty tumor tissues (pre- and post-treatment) after 3 to 4 cycles of NACT were collected from HGSC patients at interval cytoreductive debulking surgery from the following groups: excellent response to NACT with carboplatin\/paclitaxel (post-ER, n=8); poor response to NACT (post-PR, n=8). Primary or metastatic sites for each patient were obtained (n=13, post-ER; n=17, post-PR) and subjected to RNA sequencing. The downstream bioinformatics analysis was then performed and compared with the data from the matched pre-NACT samples from the same patients (Lee et al., Cell Reports, 2020).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified a total of 9,764 upregulated and 2,762 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs, absolute log2FC &#62;=2, adj-p&#60;0.05) in the post-NACT samples vs the pre-NACT samples in the ER group. In contrast, 11,246 upregulated and 1,320 downregulated DEGs were found in the NACT-PR group. Ovarian cancer-related genes, including <i>KRAS, NRAS, BRCA1\/2, RB1, NF1, MLH1, PIK3CA, MSH2<\/i>, <i>AKT1<\/i>, and <i>NOTCH3<\/i> were differentially expressed in post-NACT <i>vs<\/i> pre-NACT in both ER and PR groups. <i>TP53<\/i> was exclusively upregulated in post-ER <i>vs<\/i> pre-ER, and <i>GABRA6<\/i> was exclusively upregulated in post-PR <i>vs<\/i> pre-PR.

Although precision therapies for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC have developed over the past two decades, the 5-year survival rate remains low at 0%-26%. Thus, recurrence monitoring and treatment at an early stage are of great significance for improving survival benefits. Here, we explored the genetic characteristics of early stage NSCLC patients to provide additional values to predict recurrence risk and treatment strategies.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tumor or plasma samples were collected from 146 Chinese NSCLC patients in stage I-III (127 LUAD, 5 LUSC, 2 LUASC, 12 unknown pathology). 733 cancer-related genes were sequenced on NGS platform for variants analysis. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was defined by all somatic mutation counts in coding region per megabase. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using antibodies (clone 22C3 or SP263) to analyze PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 positivity was defined as TPS &#8805;1%. Online databases, such as cBioPortal, TIMER2.0 and Kaplan-Meier Plotter, were also used for analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the R Software (v 4.0.5).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of 146 NSCLC patients, commonly mutated genes were detected, including <i>EGFR<\/i> (68%), <i>TP53<\/i> (40%), <i>KMT2D<\/i> (10%), <i>MSH3<\/i> (9%), <i>RBM10<\/i> (9%), <i>ZFHX3<\/i> (9%). Six pathogenic or likely pathogenic fusion variants harbored in common driver genes like <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i> and <i>ROS1<\/i> were identified for the first time. <i>EGFR<\/i> was more frequently mutated in female patients (P &#60; 0.01), while <i>CDH10<\/i> mutations occurred more often in male patients (P &#60; 0.05). Correlation analysis showed <i>RBM10<\/i>, <i>ZFHX3<\/i> and <i>CTNNB1 <\/i>mutations were respectively co-occurrent with <i>CARD11<\/i>, <i>ARHGAP5<\/i> and<i> APC<\/i>, reflecting the distinct profile of our cohort when compared to cBioPortal. Patients with <i>TP53<\/i><sub>mut<\/sub>, <i>MSH3<\/i><sub>mut<\/sub> or<i> LRP1B<\/i><sub>mut<\/sub> had significantly higher TMB (P &#60; 0.05). Compared to PD-L1- group, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>TIMELESS<\/i>, <i>FBXW7<\/i> were remarkably mutated in PD-L1+ group.

Cancer is a complex genetic disease, and no single gene has been shown to be solely responsible for the initiation, growth or progression of cancer. Therefore, more complete understanding of the multiple genes responsible for disease progression, and more specifically, for the development of BM is needed to support development of diagnostic tools and novel therapeutics for BM.<br \/>The aim of this study was to identify genetic signatures specific for BM in solid tumors, more specifically in breast cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PC).<br \/>Genetic data was obtained from cBioPortal. A dataset of 500 metastatic solid tumors was used based on availability of metastasis-specific biopsy data (Robinson et al. Integrative clinical genomics of metastatic cancer, Nature 2017). Altogether 40 of the patients (8%) had BM, of which 27 (67,5%) with PC and 8 (20%) with BC. All cancer biopsy samples were grouped to &#8216;BM-only&#8217; (n = 40) and &#8216;no-BM&#8217; (n = 460) groups, indicating the presence or absence of BM. The same comparisons were made separately for BC and PC. To confirm cancer type specificity of the findings, the BC and PC BM-only data were compared. Only significant findings (p&#60;0.05) are reported. Finally, the impact of identified altered genes on clinical outcome (survival) was analyzed more broadly in BC (13 studies, over 7 000 samples) and PC (19 studies, over 6 000 samples) specific datasets.<br \/>Altogether 48 genetic alterations including mutations and gene-fusions were identified in BM-only group. From the 48 genes, 8 and 3 corresponded to genetic alterations observed in BC and PC, respectively, when comparing BM-only and no-BM groups. None of these genes overlapped in BC and PC BM-only samples. In BC, the identified 8 genes were GPR139, RASIP1, DTHD1, GGT7, LONP2, ATG4B, PI15 and MKRN3. Of these, GPR139 was associated with improved relapse-free survival, RASIP1 with decreased disease-free survival, GGT7 with improved disease-free survival, and PI15 with lower overall survival when comparing patients with altered or unaltered genes across BC cohorts. In PC, the 3 genes were RNF139, KRTAP4-7 and ZNF516. Of these, RNF139 was associated with decreased overall, disease and progression free survival across PC cohorts.<br \/>The study identified four genetic alterations in BC (GPR139, RASIP1, GGT7, PI15) and one in PC (RNF139) that were associated with altered survival in patients. Best to our knowledge, none of these genes have been associated with BM earlier. Further studies are warranted to understand significance of these genes for developing novel therapeutics or diagnostic tools for bone metastatic cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8c623000-c89a-47d6-b679-585e8a334dfb\/@y03B8ZSN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Bone metastasis,Breast cancer,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17856"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tiina E.

The only known precursor to EAC is Barrett&#8217;s Esophagus (BE), but the precise mechanisms and molecular events leading to disease progression are still being unraveled. In recent years, analysis of TCGA data revealed that isoform switching events with predicted functional consequences are common in many cancers, but the characterization of switching events in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is lacking. Next-generation sequencing was utilized to detect levels of RNA transcripts and specific isoforms in 66 treatment na&#239;ve esophageal tissues from 41 patients. Tissues ranged from premalignant Barrett&#8217;s esophagus (BE), BE with low or high-grade dysplasia (LGD or HGD) to EAC. Samples were stratified by histopathology, p53 mutation status, and significant isoform switching events with predicted functional consequences, followed by enrichment analysis. Barrett&#8217;s with high-grade dysplasia increased risk for EAC progression. Comparing BE with LGD and BE with HGD, isoform switching events were identified in 75 genes including KRAS, APC, RNF-128 and WRAP53. Stratification based on p53 status increased the number of significant isoform switches to 135 suggesting switching events impact cellular functions based on tissue histopathology, as well as p53 status. Analysis of isoforms agnostic to mutant p53, exclusive to mutant p53, and shared between the two groups revealed unique signatures including demethylation, lipid and retinoic acid metabolism, and glucuronidation, respectively. About 25% of isoform switching events were identified without significant alteration of gene-level expression. Importantly, two p53-interacting isoforms, RNF128 and WRAP53, were significantly linked to patient survival. Analysis of global isoform switching consequences and alternative splicing events also revealed significant changes in the fraction of coding transcripts, complete open-reading-frames, signal peptides, alternative 5&#8217; donor sites, and alternative transcription start sites. Thus, analysis of isoform switching events may provide new insight for the identification of prognostic markers and inform new potential therapeutic targets for EAC treatment or prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0011c698-cbea-40b4-a71f-ff3ce13031fc\/@y03B8ZSN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Barrett's esophagus,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Isoform switching,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17857"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yun Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine M.

The incidence of LASC is very low, only comprising 0.4-4% of all lung cancers. LASC yields a more aggressive clinical course, and its prognosis is generally worse than that of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Due to the rarity of LASC, currently, there is no standard treatment. Also, to date, limited genomic data have been performed. In this study, we analyzed the genomic alterations and clinical signatures of LASC.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues and matched blood samples were collected for a targeted, next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay at OrigiMed (Shanghai, China), a College of American Pathologists (CAP) accredited and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory.

Forty-three (43, 34.68%) patients had a smoking history and half of patients possessed a Stage III\/IV disease. The most commonly altered genes were <i>TP53<\/i> (66.9%), <i>EGFR<\/i> (54.8%), <i>CDKN2A<\/i> (21%), <i>TERT<\/i> (21%), and <i>LRP1B<\/i> (18.5%). Surprisingly, 91.1% and 52.4% patients harbored at least one druggable alteration based on the solid cancer and NSCLC NCCN guides, respectively. The most frequent druggable mutation, <i>EGFR<\/i>, is comprised of 35 (51.47%) single mutations and 33 (48.53%) complexed mutations, with most containing a 19 exon deletion and <i>EGFR<\/i> amplification (12%). The median tumor mutational burden (TMB) of patients with LASC was 5.15 muts\/Mb (range, 0-69.3 muts\/Mb), and 33 (26.6%) patients were TMB-H (TMB &#8805; 10 Muts\/Mb). Patients with an <i>ARID2<\/i>, <i>BRCA1<\/i>, or <i>KEAP1<\/i> mutation had a significantly higher value of TMB than wild type (median TMB 16.1 vs. 5 muts\/Mb, 29.7 vs. 5 muts\/Mb, 14.6 vs. 4.85 muts\/Mb, respectively, P &#60; 0.05). Patients with HRR or DDR mutations also displayed a higher TMB value than for wild type. We additionally determined that mutation signature 1 (the clock-like signature), signature 2 (the APOBEC signature), and signature 3 (the BRCA mutational signature) exhibited a higher mutational load for the entire cohort.

Differential genetic mutation profiles are not fully characterized in the context of left vs right laterality colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, we investigated associations between CRC anatomical site and somatic gene mutation patterns using whole exome sequencing.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><i> <\/i>Whole exome sequencing data were collected from 55 FFPE samples from different stages (stage I: 11, II: 9; III: 19, IV: 16), treatment-naive CRC patients using the Personalis&#174; tumor-only ImmunoID NeXT Platform&#174;, which captures somatic mutations (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs), percent MSI in the exome, oncovirus detection, etc. The R package maftools was used to identify differential rates of mutation between samples resected from the rectum, left, and right colon respectively. Maftools-derived mutated gene lists, filtered to p&#60;0.5 and odds-ratio&#62;1, were assessed for pathway enrichment with Enrichr.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><i> <\/i><i>APC<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> were the most commonly mutated genes in the entire cohort, with mutations seen in &#62;90% (<i>APC<\/i>) and &#62;75% <i>(TP53<\/i>) of samples respectively. Individual gene mutation frequency was not significantly different among the primary tumor locations (left colon; right colon; rectum) after Bonferroni multiple test correction, with <i>FBXW7<\/i>, <i>APC<\/i>, trending towards differential mutation between right colon tumors and left\/rectal tumors. Maftools-derived mutated gene lists, filtered to p&#60;0.5 and odds-ratio&#62;1, were processed with Enrichr, identifying an enrichment of estrogen-related mutation events in right-sided vs rectal tumors (n=81 genes; Bioplanet 2019; q=5x10<sup>-4<\/sup>; WikiPathway 2021 Human; q&#60;5x10<sup>-6<\/sup>). In rectal tumors compared to right side, PI3K\/AKT signaling mutations were more enriched (n=106 genes; Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 2021; q&#60;4x10<sup>-6<\/sup>; MSigDB Hallmark 2020; q=9x10<sup>-3<\/sup>).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b><i> <\/i>A statistically significant increase in frequencies of estrogen pathway gene mutations on right-sided tumors, and on PI3K\/AKT mutations on rectal tumors, were identified. These are consistent with prior expression-based findings indicating the association of estrogen signaling with right-sided tumors, and increased AKT expression with left-sided CRCs. The whole exome sequencing based laterality associated genetic mutation results provided clinically applicable evidence that patients suffered from left versus right CRC tumors may benefit differential treatment therapies, and further investigation is ongoing to explore the potential correlation between tumor laterality and stage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/99647321-3fbf-4346-a8fb-35cee24e5d9c\/@y03B8ZSN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exome sequencing,Tumor laterality,Copy number variation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17860"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Danyi Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee McDaniel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean Boyle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuseppe Locatelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juergen Scheuenpflug<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zheng Feng<\/i><\/presenter>.

The 2016 central nervous system (CNS) WHO added molecular parameters to classify CNS tumors on the basis of routine histological features, but the characteristics of gene fusion variations have not been clarified in CNS tumors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In order to identify the characteristics of gene fusions in Chinese patients with CNS malignant tumors, we retrospectively analyzed the next-generation sequencing data of 234 patients (pts) with gene fusions.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>According to WHO classification of CNS tumor, 121 pts (51.7%) were low-grade gliomas (LGG, grade I, II), and 113 pts (48.3%) were high-grade gliomas (HGG, grade III, IV). The age of pts with LGG (14.1 &#177; 16.1) was significantly lower than HGG pts (50.2 &#177; 17.4) (P&#60;0.0001). There was no significant gender difference between them (P = 0.161). In the fusion map of pts with LGG, gene fusions of <i>KIAA1549-BRAF<\/i> (n=82, 67.7%) and<i> FGFR3-TACC3<\/i> (n=7, 5.8%) occurred frequently. Meanwhile, there were 5.7% pts carrying <i>BRAF<\/i> fusions with other partners, and some other sporadic fusions. Among HGG cases, the most frequent gene fusion was <i>FGFR3-TACC3<\/i> (n=36, 31.9%), followed by fusions in <i>EGFR<\/i> (n=22, 19.5%), <i>MET<\/i> (n=16, 14.2%), <i>BRAF<\/i> (n=8, 7.1%), <i>ROS1<\/i> (n=5, 4.4%), and other sporadic genes.

Certain cytotoxic agents introduce mutations within distinct trinucleotide contexts resulting in a unique barcode for each exposed cell. We leveraged mutational signatures to investigate the role of CT in the genomic landscape of tMN with respect to antecedent clonal hematopoiesis (CH).<br \/>We analyzed 32 tMN and 2 tALL from 33 patients and interrogated for copy number abnormalities (CNA), structural variants (SV), single nucleotide variants (SNV), and mutational signatures. For 7 patients with tMN post-melphalan\/ASCT, we investigated antecedent CH using targeted sequencing on pre-melphalan samples, including autograft products.<br \/>CH variants that became clonal in tumor were seen in 5\/7 pre-melphalan\/ASCT samples (<i>TP53, RUNX1, NCOR1, NF1, CREBBP, DNMT3A, and PPM1D<\/i>)<i>.<\/i> Complex SV were seen in 7 tMNs; including chromothripsis in 6 (19.4%). In 4 cases, chromothripsis involved chromosome 19 with hyper-amplification of the <i>SMARCA4<\/i> locus (&#8805;5 copies). Mutational signature analysis revealed 6 known single base substitution (SBS) signatures in tMN including melphalan (SBS-MM1) and platinum signatures (SBS31, SBS35, and E-SBS37). TMNs with CT signatures had higher mutation burden than those without (p = 0.004). 17 patients with exposure to agents other than melphalan\/platinum did not have increased mutational burden with respect to <i>de novo<\/i> AML (TCGA; NEJM, 2013).<br \/>All patients with prior platinum exposure (including tALL, n=9) had platinum SBS signatures while only 2 of 7 patients with prior melphalan\/ASCT had a melphalan signature (SBS-MM1). Detection of CT signatures in bulk sequencing relies on one cell, with its barcode of mutations, to expand to clonal dominance. Given pre-existent CH, including in 3\/3 autograft products, absence of a CT signature despite melphalan exposure implies progression by a clone that escaped CT exposure with stem-cell collection and reinfusion. Conversely, all platinum-exposed tAML had signature evidence of exposure confirming existence of CH prior to exposure and supporting post-CT single-cell expansion. TMNs from 3 patients exposed to sequential platinum and melphalan\/ASCT had platinum but not melphalan signatures confirming single-cell expansion of the pre-tMN CH clone post-platinum but with escape from exposure to melphalan via leukapheresis. Chromothripsis events bore only non-duplicated CT-induced mutations, indicative of acquisition prior to, and not directly caused by, CT exposure.<br \/>These disparities suggest that ASCT provides a mechanism for CH clones to escape CT and re-engraft with transplant. Coupled with driver events accrued prior to CT, this suggest that CT-induced mutagenesis may be less important than other factors, such as CT-induced immunosuppression, in the expansion of pre-TMN CH clones.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dbc55d02-9d9c-4eb4-a78d-7d56dab9ca67\/@z03B8ZSP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy,Mutagenesis,Sequencing,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17863"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin Diamond<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bachisio Ziccheddu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eileen M.

We investigated this approach in the mCRC palliative treatment setting by exploring the potential clinical utility of the validated Guardant Health Molecular Response (MR) algorithm.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Longitudinal plasma samples (70) were collected from 14 patients with mCRC and treated using chemotherapy alone or combined with one or more targeting agents. All patients were clinically stable or had clinical benefit over the course of plasma collection. 6 patients had radiological response by RECISTv1.1 and 10 had tumor RAS\/RAF mutation status. Baseline and longitudinal plasma samples (27-276 days post treatment) were tested by GuardantOMNI&#174; 500-gene liquid biopsy assay. Selection of qualifying alterations and generation of MR scores were pursued using the Guardant Health MR algorithm.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> Thirteen patients were evaluable for MR by having somatic alterations at each timepoint that exceeded the molecule threshold required for reliable MR score calculation. Mean variant allele fraction (mVAF) of all plasma samples outside the 4-10 week on-treatment window trended in the same direction as the early on-treatment plasma samples when compared to baseline. Eleven patients experienced a consistent reduction in mVAF compared to baseline. One outlier showed a mVAF increase at the earliest on-treatment timepoint, followed by molecular clearance at all subsequent timepoints. GuardantOMNI&#174; detected a frameshift <i>APC<\/i> alteration at the baseline of this patient, which may have limited the tumor response to the chemotherapy. The second outlier patient was originally diagnosed as RAS\/RAF wild-type and treated with anti-EGFR and anti-PD-L1. MR scores for this patient across all timepoints reflected an increase in mVAF compared to baseline.

Apart from definite familial genetic disease, a considerable proportion of EOCRC remained unknown of the mechanism. Characterizing the difference in genomic features of EOCRC and late-onset CRC (LOCRC) would help us to understand it.<br \/>Methods: A total of 1777 Chinese CRC patients diagnosed in 2019-2020 were included. 489 patients under 50 years were defined as EOCRC. A 733-gene panel next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing and measurement of tumor mutational burden (TMB) levels based on the panel were conducted in all patients&#8217; tumor specimen. Lynch syndrome (LS) was defined as patients harboring at least one non-benign germline mutation in four LS MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2).<br \/>Results: 43 of 489(8.8%) cases and 54 of 1288 (4.2%) cases were MSI-H in EOCRC and LOCRC, separately. Excluded 97 LS patients (84.3% in MSI-H EOCRC and 72.0% in MSI-H LOCRC), the proportion of non-LS MSI-H in EOCRC and in LOCRC were 1.8% and 1.7%, separately. Compared to non-LS MSI-H LOCRC, EOCRC has higher germline mutational frequencies in APC, CD74, ATM, BCL2L11, CHEK2, and RECQL4 genes and somatic mutational frequencies in APC, ERCC4, CHD2, ARHGAP5, CASP8, and ATM genes. In non-LS MSS patients, germline mutations in CHEK2, NBN and POLE genes, somatic SNV\/indels in RNF43, ATR, AFF3, JAK2, POLG, CHD2 genes and somatic copy number gain in genes on chromosome 8 (ZNF703, FGFR1, MYC, PTK2) occurred more frequently in EOCRC. KEGG enrichment analysis in somatic mutations indicated significant overexpressed MAPK signaling pathway. The TMB level was significantly lower in non-LS MSS EOCRC than in LOCRC.<br \/>Conclusions: The proportion of non-LS MSI-H in Chinese EOCRC and LOCRC were approximate. Non-LS MSS EOCRC had marked chromosome 8 somatic copy number gain and MAPK signaling pathway, indicating the potential mechanism. The comparative lower TMB level in EOCRC was concordance with previous studies and the correlations between low TMB level and high CNV burden also corroborate the etiopathogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/11b7929a-a1cf-496f-8cf9-adc7ac21eae1\/@A03B8ZSQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17873"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiancheng Zeng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junhao Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yurong Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hailiang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyi Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengli Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

It provides a noninvasive approach to interrogate a patient&#8217;s genomic landscape and actionable mutations with well application prospect. However, the difference of genomic profiles between tissue and ctDNA still brings confusions to related researches. Therefore, we tried to elucidate whether blood-based ctDNA has its own characteristic profile to reflect tumor status in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).<br \/>Methods: Tumor tissue and blood samples from 118 HCC patients of Xiangya Hospital Central South University, were analyzed using NGS (panel on 147 gene). NGS data from a Chinese population extended cohort (385 tissues and 79 blood samples) of HCC were used to validate the mutation characteristics. Data from HCC cohorts of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to analyze the disease-free survival (DFS) of different mutations.<br \/>Results: In the hospital cohort, there were 9 high-frequency mutant genes in tissue and blood, including TP53 (74.58% vs 74.58%), MSH2(23.73% vs 8.47%), LRP1B (20.34% vs 23.73%), ATM (18.64% vs 13.56%), CTNNB1 (11.86% vs 13.56%) et.al which consistent with previous reports. There were 32 genes (74.04%) with a mutation frequency of more than 6% that were unique to blood samples. In extended cohort, the mutation profile was similar to the hospital cohort, in which 35 genes (52.24%) specific in ctDNA profile and 18 genes of them identical to the hospital cohort. Interestingly, when these ctDNA-specific genes were analysed by gene ontology, most genes were involved in angiogenesis. The prognostic analysis in ctDNA-specific genes showed that patients with higher level of MAP3K1 had worse DFS (p=0.028). In addition, the gene co-expression network analysis showed MAP3K1 and NOTCH1\/2\/3 expression had a significant positive correlation, that Notch family members were also belonged to the ctDNA-specific genes and associated with tumor immune escape.<br \/>Conclusions: The results showed the mutation characteristic of tissues and ctDNA in HCC, and suggest that angiogenic and tumor immune escape related ctDNA-specific genes might be able to predict recurrence risk independently of baseline tissue samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/31c89362-3013-44a0-8f8e-277c794e61b8\/@A03B8ZSQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,ctDNA,MAP3K1 ,NGS ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17874"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lin Chia Yan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liu Miao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hu Xue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huang Meng Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

No reliable prognostication model has been available to optimize the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy either. To develop novel molecular classification and prognostication systems, we conducted large-scale studies of gene mutations and transcriptomes involving 3056 well-annotated CRC patients.<br \/><u>Methods:<\/u> All patients were analyzed for mutations in 169 known\/putative driver genes in CRC using targeted-capture sequencing, which also include1,630 SNPs sequenced to assess genome-wide copy numbers. RNA sequencing was also performed for gene expression profiling and comprehensive detection of gene fusions.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> Based on the strong mutually exclusive and co-occuring mutation patterns of mutations in Wnt pathway, non-hypermutated CRC patients (90%) were further classified into APC-mutated (81%) and unmutated (9%) case. The former was further divided into <i>TP53<\/i>-mutated (70%) and unmutated (11%), while the latter was into <i>CTNNB1<\/i>-mutated (2.7%), <i>RNF43<\/i>-mutated (1.7%), <i>RSPO<\/i>-fusion-positive (2%), and other cases (2.7%). Among these, <i>TP53<\/i>-unmutated CRC was characterized by significantly higher and lower numbers of mutations and copy number alterations, respectively, while accounting for 70% of all CRCs, the APC\/TP53-double mutated &#8216;canonical CRC&#8217; cases were classified into 13 unique subtypes having unique mutational profiles using non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering. Next we modeled overall (OS) and relapse free (RFS) survival using Cox proportional hazard modeling with 1000 times cross validations using lasso. The final prediction model included gene mutations and copy number abnormalities, together with age, sex, stage, and tumor location, based on which we classified patients into groups having distinct OS and RFS in each stage. Importantly, adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) was shown to have significantly different impacts on RFS between different risk groups within Stage2 and 3 CRC.<br \/><u>Conclusions:<\/u> On the basis of comprehensive mutation analysis in a large cohort, we developed novel molecular classification of CRC. We further identified distinct risk groups showing different RFS and OS, which showed relationship to the efficacy of ACT, which could be used for risk stratification in Stage2 and Stage3 CRC for optimized use of ACT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2fc9d72e-28a6-4896-b34b-56d059d98cfb\/@A03B8ZSQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17875"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yoshikage Inoue<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nobuyuki Kakiuchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenichi Yoshida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuhito Nanya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuhide Takeuchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoichi Fujii<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuichi Shiraishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenichi Chiba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Nagayama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazutaka Obama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seishi Ogawa<\/i><\/presenter>.

Tumor mutational burden (TMB) measurements aid in identifying patients who are likely to benefit from immunotherapy. In most cases, there is no result of a paired normal tissues. Therefore, it is difficult to effectively exclude germline mutations, so it does not effectively reflect the TMB of cancer driver mutation. We aimed to modify the TMB analysis pipeline to reflect the germline and multi-nucleotide variants (MNVs), specifically for Korean solid tumors. &#8220;CancerMaster&#8221; is custom RNA probes for target enrichment sequencing. It consists of all unions (7,811 regions, 2.5Mb) of reported exons of 524 tumor and immune related genes. The panel contains special RNA probes, which enables detection of microsatellite instability, Epstein-Barr virus and Human papillomavirus. This Panel sensitivity, precision, and TMB were assessed using immunohistochemistry and TruSight Oncology 500 for well-characterized samples (cellularity &#8804; 20% and sequencing QC passed, n = 415). We achieved a mean coverage of 1,183x, with sensitivity and specificity of &#62;99% and precision of &#62;97% in alteration. We performed MNV analysis for more accurate mutation analysis. We used WhatsHap for haplotype phasing and the bcftools to call the MNV. The MNV-rich genes were HLA-A (2019 sites), HLA-B (1284 sites), and HLA-C (825 sites), and BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM and ATR, a DNA repair-related genes, was also identified at more than 30 sites. In addition, up to 14 MNVs were detected in one sample. In this study, we analyzed putative driver mutations that removed germline mutations, referring to the ACMG guidelines for sequence variant interpretation based on the Korean genome database (KOVA and KRGDB) and gnomAD. The TMB was recalculated by reflecting the MNV and the putative driver mutation. As a result, it was confirmed that this upgraded TMB analysis was similar to TMB calculated through actual somatic mutation through comparison with normal tissues. The TMB-high (20&#8804;) sample was 8.4% (36\/415) for pan-cancer, but 6.9% (20\/289) for gastric cancer and 25% (12\/48) for colorectal cancer showed differences by cancer type. In addition, it was confirmed that there is a correlation between TMB-high and MSI-H (sensitivity : 70.0%, specificity 99.5%, accuracy 95.9%) In conclusion, we validated TMB analysis pipeline for the expansion of immunotherapeutic applications in treatment-refractory Korean solid cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/216b2dc6-5794-47bc-89f7-933270187664\/@A03B8ZSQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Tumor mutational burden,putative somatic mutations,multi-nucleotide variants,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17878"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Woo Sun Kwon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingmin Che<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Young Rha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Cheol Chung<\/i><\/presenter>.

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for advanced PLELC and tumor genomic features underlying varied treatment responses remains poorly investigated.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The study involved 33 PLELC patients with clinically annotated outcomes to ICIs. Targeted sequencing covering 520 cancer related genes were performed in 22 patients to identify single nucleotide variations (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs), tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability. Mutation profiles of PLELC were compared with other NSCLC subtypes including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSC) as well as EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in public databases. Associations between PLELC mutation profiles and treatment responses to ICIs were analyzed. An external dataset of ICI-treated melanoma was used in further analysis of B2M.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), durable clinical benefit (DCB) rate, and median PFS was 18.2%, 60.6%, 45.5%, and 4.5 months respectively. Genetic alterations were frequently identified in B2M (9 of 22, 41%), CDKN1B (7 of 22, 32%), TP53 (6 of 22, 27%), SGK1 (5 of 22, 23%), NFKBIA (4 of 22, 18%) and TNFAIP3 (4 of 22, 18%). CNVs were comprehensively presented in PLELC while SVNs were less common. In our study, 8 of 9 tumors with B2M mutations and all tumors with CDKN1B, SGK1, TNFAIP3 mutations harbored copy number amplifications. Mutation profiles of PLELC were largely different from those of LUAD and LUSC but were similar to NPC. The median TMB was 2.99 mutations\/Mb. All tumors were microsatellite stable (MSS). Patients with higher TMB showed improved DCR (p=0.029), PFS (p=0.056) and overall survival (p=0.038) than those with lower TMB. Patients with lower baseline plasma EBV DNA level also had longer PFS (p&#60;0.001). The presence of B2M amplifications was significant associated with higher TMB level (p=0.022). The PFS of 7 patients with high TMB and amplified B2M were significantly longer than that of other patients (p=0.046). In the external dataset, higher expression of B2M was associated with better ICI responses for melanoma (p&#60;0.05). Pathways involving anti-tumor immune responses such as NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, antigen processing and presentation were correlated with high B2M expression while Wnt, TGF-beta and MAPK pathways that define poor response to ICI were correlated with low B2M expression.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study observed comprehensive CNVs in PLELC patients which is a unique molecular feature compared with other NSCLC subtypes and EBV-positive NPC.

Nevertheless, patients with acral and mucosal melanomas show limited benefit. The proportion of acral and mucosal subtypes are much higher in Chinese populations than Caucasians. Therefore, it is of great interest to detail the genomic features of acral and mucosal melanomas and compare these with cutaneous melanoma.<br \/>Methods: A total of 111 Chinese patients with melanoma treated in Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology were enrolled in this study, comprising 32 cutaneous(28.8%), 41 acral(36.9%) and 26 mucosal(23.4%) subtypes. NGS-based genomic profiling of major cancer-related genes was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue specimens with matched blood samples. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated based on somatic nonsynonymous missense mutations.<br \/>Results: The most commonly mutated genes of cutaneous melanoma include <i>BRAF<\/i>(48%), <i>CDKN2A<\/i>(41%), <i>CDKN2B<\/i>(41%), <i>NRAS<\/i>(22%) and <i>PTEN<\/i>(22%). In acral melanoma patients, the mutation rate of <i>BRAF<\/i> was 10% while <i>NRAS<\/i>(31%),<i> CDKN2A<\/i>(21%), <i>EMSY<\/i>(21%), <i>KIT<\/i>(18%), <i>CCND1<\/i>(18%)) and <i>NF1<\/i>(18%) were frequently mutated. Mucosal melanomas were found most commonly to have mutations in <i>CDKN2A<\/i>(36%),<i> KIT<\/i>(32%), <i>CDKN2B<\/i>(28%), <i>PDGFRA<\/i>(24%), <i>KDR<\/i>(20%) and <i>BRAF<\/i>(16%). In acral and mucosal subtypes, the overall mutation rates of <i>BRAF<\/i> were significantly lower while the relative proportions of non-V600 mutations were higher as compared to cutaneous subtype. These may explain the less significant survival benefit of BRAFi+\/-MEKi in acral and mucosal melanomas. In contrast, <i>KIT<\/i> mutations including SNVs and amplification, were enriched in acral and mucosal melanomas. Acral melanomas had lower mutation load than mucosal melanomas(2.42 Muts\/Mb vs 4.84 Muts\/Mb, p=0.0002), while cutaneous melanomas(4.03 Muts\/Mb) did not differ from other subtypes in mutation burden. Additionally, patients with <i>TERT<\/i>, <i>APC <\/i>and <i>FAT1<\/i> gene mutations had a significantly higher TMB than patients with wild-type genes respectively, indicating more activated anti-tumor immune profiles and suggesting therapeutic benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/>Conclusions: We conducted a direction comparison of comprehensive genomic profiles of different melanoma subtypes among Chinese patients. The genomic alterations identified in our study may provide reference to discover potential strategies for targeted therapy and immunotherapy in acral and mucosal melanomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad3ba4b0-473b-4228-8ab4-224d8c040dcc\/@A03B8ZSQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Gene profiling,BRAF,Tumor mutational burden,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17882"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jing Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ting Ye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jieying Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rubo Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanshen Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

BTCs are mainly classified as gallbladder cancer (GBC) and cholangiocarcinomas (CCA) with dismal prognosis. Genetic landscape of BTC can offer a comprehensive understanding of its carcinogenesis and clinical associations. The present study aims to compare the molecular features between BTC subtypes and explore clues for treatment therapies.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed 258 BTC tissue samples including 70 GBCs and 188 CCAs with targeted sequencing (NGS) using a 425 caner-relevant genes panel. We identified the somatic alterations and MSI status of all samples. TMB was counted by summing all base substitutions and indels in the coding region of targeted genes. TMB-high (TMB-H) was defined as mutation number &#8805; 10mut\/Mb.<br \/>Results: The most frequently mutated genes in 258 BTCs were <i>TP53 <\/i>(56.6%), <i>KRAS <\/i>(27.9%), <i>CDKN2A <\/i>(21.3%), <i>TERT <\/i>(17.8%) and <i>MCL1 <\/i>(14.3%). Four gene mutations and 2 gene amplifications were significantly enriched in GBC compared to CCA (mutations P&#60;0.05, amplifications P&#60;0.01): <i>TP53 <\/i>(78.8% vs 47.9%), <i>ARID2 <\/i>(15.7% vs 3.7%), <i>STK11 <\/i>(12.9% vs 4.3%), <i>TERT <\/i>(24.3% vs 11.2%), <i>CCNE1 <\/i>and <i>SOX2 <\/i>amplifications (21.4% vs 2.7%, 4.3% vs 0%). However, <i>ARID1A <\/i>mutation (15.4% vs 5.7%), <i>PBRM1 <\/i>mutation (10.1% vs 0%), and <i>MCL1 <\/i>amplification (17.0% vs 5.7%) were more frequently existed in CAA (all P&#60;0.05). Seven actionable alterations, including <i>IDH1<\/i>\/<i>2<\/i> (5.4%), <i>FGFR1<\/i>-<i>4<\/i> (4.7%), <i>ERBB2 <\/i>(6.2%), <i>PIK3CA <\/i>(5.4%), <i>MET <\/i>(3.5%), and <i>BRCA1<\/i>\/<i>2<\/i> (5.0%), were detected with different occurrence frequencies in two subtypes. <i>ERBB2 <\/i>was predominant in GBC (15.7% vs 7.4%, p&#60;0.001), while <i>IDH1<\/i>\/<i>2<\/i> and <i>KRAS <\/i>alteration rates were much higher in CCA (8% vs 0%, 31.4% vs 18.6%, both P&#60;0.05). <i>FGFR3 <\/i>alterations were also tended to be enriched in CCA (7.1% vs 2.7%), although no significant difference was found. In general, there were 25.7% of GBC patients harboring actionable alterations versus 29.3% of CCA patients. In addition, 40 (15.5%, 13 GBCs and 27 CCAs) and 11 (4.3%, 10 GBCs and 1 CCA) patients were TMB-H and MSI-H, respectively, suggesting the possibility of benefit from immunotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: There were distinct molecular features in somatic variations and actionable alterations between GBSs and CCAs. In general, 44.3% of GBC and 46.3% CCA may benefit from targeted therapy and immunotherapy.

Somatic reversion mutations were indel or missense mutations that restore the open reading frame and potentially protein function fully or partially. Definitive reversion mutations are confirmed secondary mutations in patients with known pathogenic germline HRR gene mutations, or in a subsequent sample of previously detected somatic pathogenic mutants. Other reversion mutations are putative due to lack of matched samples.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Overall, we found 31\/1,992 (1.6%) tumors with definitive or putative HRR reversion mutations, including 17 with germline and 14 with somatic predisposed pathogenic HRR mutations.

We also found pathogenic germline <i>PALB2<\/i> (1, 3%) and <i>RAD41D <\/i>(1, 3%), and somatic mutations in <i>CDK12 <\/i>(3, 9%), <i>ATM<\/i> (2, 6%), <i>WRN <\/i>(1, 3%), <i>FANCD2 <\/i>(1, 3%),<i> <\/i>and <i>ATR <\/i>(1, 3%). Overall, 43 reversion mutations were detected (37 definitive and 6 putative), with eight patients carrying multiple reversion mutations. Importantly, 40\/43 reversion mutations were found within 2bp upstream to the start site of original deleterious variants, and all were unique to currently known database. Missense-induced reversions were found in 74% primary stop-gain mutations, while indel-induced reversions were associated with 59% primary frameshift mutations. These HRR reversion mutations were primarily found in breast cancer (9%, 10\/107) and ovarian cancer (6%, 3\/54), and also in cases of prostate (1\/25, 4%), pancreatic (1\/29, 3%), colorectal (2%, 9\/418), and non-small cell lung cancer (1%, 6\/703). Of note, the incidence of multiple HRR reversion mutations was higher in breast cancer (75%, 6\/8).

In patients with sufficient clinical follow-up, dual drivers were associated with unfavorable PFS outcomes compared with single drivers (HR=2.87, P=.04) following first-line first-generation EGFR TKIs, which was mainly attributed to the presence of <i>MET<\/i> amplification or <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations. In addition, in dual <i>EGFR<\/i>\/<i>KRAS<\/i> and <i>EGFR<\/i>\/<i>BRAF<\/i> drivers, a higher MAF of <i>EGFR<\/i> than that of the respective co-occurring driver was associated with a trend towards prolonged PFS (11.0 vs. 8.1m, HR= 0.21, P=.15), likely suggesting clonal advantage of <i>EGFR<\/i> sensitizing mutations in response to first-generation TKIs.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>In our large cohort study, we present the landscape of <i>EGFR<\/i>+ dual drivers and their associated clinical and genomic features and survival outcomes, which could aid in therapeutic decisions and facilitate the development of combination therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/035bb165-c43f-42df-acbc-7c4f4b997996\/@A03B8ZSQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Gene profiling,Response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17885"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaonan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junli Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chuqiao Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiani C.

For patients with uncommon <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations (u<i>EGFR<\/i>), such as G719X, S768I, L861Q and exon 20 insertions, first-generation TKIs might still be one of the mainstay choices in clinic. However, they exhibited heterogeneity in treatment responses. Here, we aimed to elucidate different genomic profiles of tumors carrying uncommon EGFR activating mutations to explain differential treatment responses.<br \/>Method: We screened 6669 NSCLC patients that underwent targeted NGS of 416 cancer-related genes. Total 2280 <i>EGFR-<\/i>positive NSCLCs were selected for analysis. We compared somatic mutations, tumor mutation burden (TMB), mutational signature and canonical oncogenic pathways between c<i>EGFR<\/i> and u<i>EGFR<\/i>. A validation set of 159 NSCLCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used. Adjusted p value less than 0.1 were considered statistically significant.<br \/>Results: Only patients carrying known <i>EGFR<\/i> activating mutations and without complex mutations were included. The final cohort comprised 1022 patients with L858R (44.8%), 973 with exon 19 deletion (42.7%), 139 with exon 20 insertion (6.1%), 59 with G719X (2.6%), 51 with L861Q (2.2%), and 36 with S768I (1.6%). In general, clinical features were equally distributed except for higher prevalence of G719X and S768I in male. Most frequently co-mutated genes were similar between c<i>EGFR<\/i> and u<i>EGFR<\/i> subgroups, including<i> TP53 <\/i>(56% vs 60%), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (8% vs 11%), and <i>RB1<\/i> (8% vs 9%). Despite these, we found enrichment of <i>EPHA3<\/i> and <i>MED12<\/i> with S768I(both 5\/36, 14%)as compared to with c<i>EGFR<\/i> (2% vs 3%, padj&#60;0.1), while <i>GATA6<\/i> predominantly co-occurred with L861Q (4\/51, 8%,). Overall, patients carrying u<i>EGFR<\/i> had significantly higher TMB than those with c<i>EGFR<\/i> (median TMB 5.07 vs 3.80, p=0.0076), indicating more complicated clonal backgrounds that potentially led to the poor TKI response. Among the ten oncogenic pathways, the hippo pathway markedly more altered more in those with u<i>EGFR<\/i> than with c<i>EGFR<\/i> (p=0.0025). Moreover, we found higher fraction of immunoglobulin-related signature (signature 9) and <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>-associated signature (signature 3) in tumors with c<i>EGFR<\/i> than with u<i>EGFR<\/i> (p = 0. 0003 and 0. 02, respectively). Importantly, smoking induced mutations (signature 4) were enriched in u<i>EGFR<\/i> subgroup (p = 0. 0015), which was also verified in TCGA samples. Further, 28 patients had confirmed treatment with first-generation TKIs, where u<i>EGFR<\/i> were associated with poor outcomes (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 0.81-2.52).<br \/>Conclusion: This comprehensive analysis of <i>EGFR<\/i>-positive mutational landscape revealed specific genomic characteristics associated with uncommon <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations that might explain their poor response to first-generation TKIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e5dd9e5-d18d-452d-8e1b-ff05218f0efb\/@B03B8ZSR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene profiling,Targeted therapy,Response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17886"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xue Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junli Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingwen Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yedan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yang Shao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Tumor with round cell component shows poor clinical prognosis. Currently, specific target therapies for this tumor type have not been developed. We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of paired samples to investigate genomic alteration in MLS with two histologic features.<br \/>Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing data were acquired from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of 10 patients. We performed differential gene expression analysis and pathway analysis between the conventional myxoid liposarcoma area lesion and that of round cell component using transcriptome sequencing data. In addition, we analyzed characteristics of mutational signatures in the two histologic features of MLS using WES data.<br \/>Results: CD37 showed the most significant expression in round cell components of myxoid liposarcoma (RMLS) compared to conventional MLS. The immune response pathway was significantly enriched in the conventional lesion. The pathway involving cell mitotic and metabolic processes were represented considerably in with RMLS. FUS-DDIT3\/EWSR1-DDIT3 fusion oncogene was detected in these RMLS samples more frequently than MLS. Some patients showed mutational signatures related to oxidative stress.<br \/>Conclusion: The expression of CD37 was highly expressed in almost all the RMLS. We identified smoking profile signature characteristics in these two samples, but no significant mutational difference was placed between the RMLS and MLS samples. In RMLS, the fusion oncogene and other overexpression oncogenes that occur in the cell cycle affect lipid metabolism due to oxidative stress such as ROS. Finally, we observed CD37 expression by performing IHC only in RMLS samples. The above data suggest that CD37 and other markers can be a promising biomarker target in myxoid liposarcoma with unfavorable histological features.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e805c46-2251-4bbe-9986-c6737ffb7e6e\/@B03B8ZSR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Cancer,Heterogeneity,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17887"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jee Hoon Chae<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun il Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Do Hee Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sangkyum Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Junjeong Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The population was sub-divided into young (&#8804;40 years old) and old (&#62;40 years old) BC patients according to ages at diagnosis. Young and old BC patients were compared for their associations with genomic aberrations, with focus on existing BC targetable alterations, including those in the <i>ERBB2<\/i> gene and PI3K and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways.<br \/>Results: 137 (31.1%) patients presented with BC at a young age (median age=35 [18-40]) and 303 (68.9%) with BC diagnosed at an older age (median age=53 [41-82]) in our study cohort. <i>TP53<\/i> (young, 61.3%; old, 67%), <i>PIK3CA <\/i>(33.6% and 41.3%), and <i>GATA3<\/i> (9.5% and 8.3%) were among the top frequently altered genes in both subgroups.

Between 3 and 6% of all CRC cases are attributed to hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC). It is important to distinguish CRCs that arise hereditarily from those that arise sporadically, because patients with HCRC and their relatives can benefit from intensive clinical management and surveillance. The detection of germline variants using tumor tissue and paired non-cancerous tissue\/whole blood cells (WBC) (conventional method) is considered as the gold standard for germline confirmation, but which could introduce high cost and long turnaround time. In this work, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of diagnosing HCRC using only tumor next-generation sequencing data without normal tissue\/WBC data.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>One-hundred patients with suspected HCRC were prospectively enrolled according to the clinical diagnosis. Both tumor tissue and paired WBC were collected from each patient. Capture-based targeted sequencing using a panel consisting of 41 cancer-related genes was performed on both tumor tissue and WBC sample. The germline variants were identified using conventional and ColonCore method, respectively. The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of ColonCore method in identifying germline alterations were calculated, when conventional method was used as a reference.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A<b> <\/b>total of 636 alterations were identified using ColonCore method, including 606 somatic alterations and 30 germline alterations. Among the somatic alterations detected from this panel, 599 single-nucleotide variants and 7 copy number variants were observed. The most frequently mutated genes were <i>APC<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, and <i>KRAS<\/i>, occurring in 76%, 66%, and 46% of patients, respectively. For ColonCore analysis, 17, 9, 2, and 2 patients harbored germline pathogenic variants in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, <i>APC<\/i>, <i>MUTYH<\/i>, and <i>ATM<\/i>, respectively. Compared to the conventional method, the sensitivity of ColonCore method in the diagnosis of HCRC achieved 88.5% with a PPV of 82.1%. Next, the diagnostic performance of ColonCore method in Lynch syndrome (LS) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) was subsequently investigated. We found its sensitivity in the diagnosis of LS achieved 100% (with a PPV of 98.8%), which was obviously higher than that in the diagnosis of FAP (70.0% with a PPV of 63.6%). Twenty-three patients identified as having a microsatellite instability (MSI)-high tumor using ColonCore method were also identified as having an MMR-deficient (dMMR) tumor using immunohistochemistry staining analysis.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our study suggests that ColorCore method is a one-stop approach for detecting germline\/somatic alterations and MSI\/dMMR status for suspected HCRC. Furthermore, ColorCore method is a feasible and valid tool to diagnose HCRC, especially LS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2b5f0f3d-1c89-461f-b1b1-d3dbb8dfb949\/@B03B8ZSR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Hereditary colorectal cancer,Next-generation sequencing,Germline alterations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17891"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cong Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fangqi Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ye Xu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Rare specific studies have evaluated the BRAF mutation characteristics in lung cancer. Currently, there are some studies suggesting that patients with BRAF mutations may be benefit from immunotherapy, while patients with BRAF V600E may benefit from targeted therapy. Here, the characteristics of BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E, in a lung cancer cohort of Chinese were analyzed. The characteristics of BRAF mutation with PD-L1 expression were also analyzed. <b>Method:<\/b> BRAF mutant samples were extracted from 12,051 our cohort samples of lung cancer that from Onco Panscan<sup>TM<\/sup> (Genetron Health) based sequencing of tissue. The characteristics of them were then investigated. Co-mutations of PD-L1 expressed BRAF samples were also analyzed.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 684 samples (5.68%) in our cohort had BRAF mutations. Only 134 (19.59%) of them were V600E mutation, maybe good response to BRAF inhibitors. 550 (80.41%) of samples were BRAF non-V600E mutation, maybe benefit from immunotherapy. BRAF mutations were more happened in male (58.3%), while female patients were increased in V600E mutation group when compared with non-V600E group (49.25% vs. 39.82%, P=0.0509). BRAF mutations were more likely to occur in LUAD than in LUSC (6.37% vs. 3.89%, P=0.0022), especially BRAF V600E mutation. The mean age of BRAF mutant patients was 61.56 &#177; 10.32 years. BRAF V600E patients was significantly older than BRAF non-V600E patients on average (63.01 &#177; 9.76 years vs. 61.20 &#177;10.43, P=0.0129). BRAF mutations were distributed across all exons but concentrated on exon 15 (269\/684, 39.33%). Moreover, BRAF V600E mutation accounted for 49.81% (134\/269) of exon 15. In our data, there were 108 samples with BRAF mutation and PD-L1 positive (TPS&#8805;1%). Among them, 95 samples (87.96%), including samples with BRAF V600E or non-V600E mutation, had no co-mutations or without other medication targets, may be benefit from BRAF inhibitors, or may be good response to immunotherapy, especially the 20 samples with TMB-high. Interestingly, 13 samples had EGFR sensitive co-mutation or EML4-ALK fusion. These 13 patients may be benefit from TKI firstly, then immunotherapy can be considered.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Most of BRAF mutations in Chinese lung cancer samples were non-V600E mutations (80.26%). BRAF mutations were more occurred in male and LUAD patients whose age around 61.56 &#177; 10.32 years. BRAF V600E patients were much older. Among PD-L1 positive and BRAF mutant samples, most BRAF mutations (87.96%), including V600E, were mutually exclusive with driver mutations of other genes.

Although standard treatment is curative for most, 5-20% of PTC patients develop RAI refractory disease &#8211; the main cause of thyroid cancer-related deaths. Early predictors indicating therapeutic response to RAI therapy in PTC are yet to be elucidated. We performed whole-exome sequencing (at a median depth of 198x) on 158 patient-matched primary PTCs and germline DNA. Clinical data was used to categorize RAI avidity in the PTC cohort. Whereby, 66 RAI refractory and 92 RAI avid tumors were identified. Clinical data and somatic variants were analyzed to compare the clinicopathological presentation, genomic landscape and mutational signatures between RAI refractory and avid PTCs. RAI refractory tumors were significantly associated with distinct aggressive clinicopathological features, including positive surgical margins (65.5% <i>versus<\/i> 26.7%; p=0.016) and the presence of lymph node metastases at primary diagnosis (62.5% <i>versus<\/i> 30.1%; p=0.012); higher nonsilent tumor mutation burden (p=0.011); and the enrichment of APOBEC-related single base substitution (SBS) COSMIC mutational signatures 2 (p=0.03) and 13 (p&#60;0.001). APOBEC mutational signatures were not associated with <i>BRAF<\/i><sup>V600E<\/sup> mutation. Notably, using multivariate logistic regression analysis only the SBS13 (odds ratio 13.01, 95% confidence intervals 1.20-140.94) APOBEC mutational signature was revealed to be an independent predictor of RAI refractoriness in PTC (p=0.035). Furthermore, using Cox proportional hazards SBS13-positive tumors (hazard ratio 3.52, 95% confidence intervals 1.79-6.91) were also significantly associated with poorer progression-free survival (p&#60;0.001), albeit only in univariate analysis. This study highlights distinct clinical and genomic features in RAI refractory PTC, but above all proposes the APOBEC SBS13 mutational signature as an independent predictor of RAI refractoriness in a more aggressive subgroup of PTC.

Approximately 10% of GC cases are associated with strong familial clustering and can be attributed to genetic predisposition. However, GC is biologically and genetically highly heterogeneous, the underlying genetic cause is complicated .DNA damage repair (DDR) genes play key roles in maintaining human genomic stability. Loss of DDR function, conversely, is an important determinant of cancer risk, progression, and therapeutic response.Our aim was to analyze the germline mutational pattern of DDR-mutated Chinese GC cohort and find possible genetic factors related to the early onset of gastric cancer.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In this analysis we defined a &#8220;core DDR&#8221; gene set with 10 homologous recombination deficiency-HRD gene (<i>BRCA1<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i> ,<i>ATM<\/i>, <i>PALB2<\/i>,<i> BRIP1<\/i>, <i>CDK12<\/i>,<i>CHEK1<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i>,<i>FANCA <\/i>and <i>FANCL<\/i>) and 4 mismatch repair-MMR gene (<i>MLH1<\/i>,<i>MSH2<\/i>,<i>PMS2<\/i> and <i>PMS6<\/i>) .The panel of 14 core DDR genes was used to analyze the germline mutation profiling of DDR-mutated GC cohort which is consisted of 144 Chinese patients with at least one germline &#8220;core DDR&#8221; gene likely pathogenic\/pathogenic (LP\/P) mutations.

Many genes identified have a distinctive effect on outcome between these two subgroups, including actionable genes, the most frequently altered genes, and the most significantly altered genes. The molecular basis is important for understanding etiology and treatment options. Uncovering these molecular differences could help optimize screening and treatment and improve outcomes for colorectal cancer for both sexes.<br \/>Materials and Methods: This study used molecular data from three TCGA Colorectal Adenocarcinoma studies (Firehose Legacy, Nature 2012, and PanCancer Atlas) on cBioPortal. The two subgroups, males and females, were separated and analyzed for molecular differences. 1496 cases (790 male, 706 female) were analyzed on cBioPortal for molecular characteristics including alterations (mutations, deletions, amplifications), overall survival, and mRNA expression vs. copy number variation (CNV). Significant differences were noted, and OncoPrints and survival curves were generated.<br \/>Results: The genes analyzed on cBioPortal showed similar alteration rates between males and females, although differences were depicted between sex and specific genes. Out of the 17 actionable genes, four had a significant effect on one sex, but not the other. ARID1A alterations increased the probability of male survival (p-value = 0.0219), ERRB2 (0.0467) and NRAS (1.118e-3) decreased survival odds for males, and NF1 (0.0107) decreased survival odds for females. CDK12 and ERBB2 co-amplification was identified for both sexes, but more prominent in males.<br \/>Multiple altered genes also had a lower probability of survival in only females. Of the most altered genes, RBFOX1 (0.0312), CSDM1 (8.631e-3), TTN (4.374e-4), WWOX (2.226e-4), CCSER1 (5.048e-3), MACROD2 (0.0366), and a 20q co-amplification cluster of CHD6 (7.313e-3), PREX1 (5.422e-3), and ZNF335 (0.0439) were significant in females. Also, among the most significant genes between males and females, TENM1 alteration (found in 11% of females and 4% of males) lowered the probability of survival in females (1.384e-6). Lastly, 75% of females remained disease free after 70 months, compared to 45% of males (8.849e-3).<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>Molecular differences in colorectal cancer between males and females are significant. TTN is important to note due to its comparison to tumor mutational burden (TMB); TTN, combined with MUC4 and MUC16, can predict TMB and may be used as a convenient biomarker for effective immunotherapy in females. ERBB2 is potentially targetable with anti HER2 therapeutics, thus may improve the worse outcome observed in males with ERBB2 alterations. Colorectal cancer has different targetable genes expressed differentially among males and females. This needs to be considered when developing screening and treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d9189fb8-ace6-474e-be55-50528ac9ee75\/@B03B8ZSR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Survival,Molecular profiling,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17897"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Roy Khalife<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Genevra Magliocco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>So Hyeon Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Magliocco<\/i><\/presenter>.

MM is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity and has a hereditary genetic component with relatives of MM patients having a higher risk of disease development. Additionally, MM displays a disparity in occurrence and mortality among sexes with males having a higher risk than females. Although new therapies have significantly improved survival rates, MM remains incurable as most patients experience relapses. Therefore, understanding the genetic control underlying complex outcomes is important for the development of better treatments for MM patients. While the majority of research has been focusing on protein-coding regions of the genome, recent studies have started to illuminate the role of non-coding variations on MM. For example, many of the 176 GWAS risk loci associated with MM susceptibility are located within or adjacent to regulatory regions, indicating a role in transcriptional regulation. However, how the non-coding genetic variations affect gene expression, tumor etiology and outcome is poorly understood.<br \/>To better understand the genetic and biological underpinnings of MM, we utilize genomic approaches to examine non-coding germline and somatic effects on gene expression and cancer outcome. First, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) from peripheral blood and WGS and RNA-seq from baseline tumor specimens of 607 participants from the CoMMpass longitudinal study of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. Using both joint and sex-stratified analyses, we detected 6,504 unique germline variants associated with changes in gene expression, i.e. expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), corresponding to 4,598 unique eGenes. Among the identified eQTLs, 33.76% exhibit sex-specific effects and 654 variants are associated with genes that influence survival in the CoMMpass cohort. In addition to the germline eQTLs, we identified 266 somatic eQTLs, corresponding to 208 eGenes. Among the identified eQTLs, 566 germline and 88 somatic eQTLs overlap with an ATACseq peak in MM cell lines. Second, we selected a set of eQTLs to validate their functions in transcriptional activity in MM cell lines (2 females, 2 males) using CRISPR interference screens (CRISPRi) with a scRNA-seq readout. By analyzing global transcriptional changes, we identify potential downstream targets that may play essential roles in MM genesis and progression. In conclusion, using computational and functional genomics approaches, we have identified germline and somatic eQTLs that are associated with gene expression and survival in MM, thus providing insights into how these non-coding variations contribute to tumor etiology and outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/93c1b4bf-4b91-4be0-8784-6dac9487e58f\/@C03B8ZSS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Genomics,Transcriptional regulation,Cancer genetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18792"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Linh T.

FFPE DNA poses many notable challenges for preparing NGS libraries, including low input amounts and highly variable damage from fixation, storage, and extraction methods. Due to the high cost of sequencing and variability of coverage, regions of interest are often specifically enriched using hybrid capture-based approaches, but these methods require a high input of diverse, uniform DNA library to achieve the coverage required for somatic mutation identification in tumor samples.We applied a multi-faceted approach to improving the yield, quality, and coverage from libraries generated from cancer patient sample sets. Using tumor-normal pairs, we evaluated the impact of our method on the sensitivity and accuracy of somatic variant detection. Matched frozen tissue provided a truth set of somatic variants for a particular tumor as well as a gold standard by which we could assess the quality of our FFPE hybrid capture libraries. Combining DNA damage repair and a novel enzymatic fragmentation mix upstream of library preparation not only reduced the false positive rate in somatic variant detection by repairing damage-derived mutations but also improved the library yield, complexity, coverage uniformity, and hybrid capture library quality metrics. The use of unique molecular identifier (UMI)-containing adaptors ensured accurate duplicate marking. Finally, a new PCR master mix boosts the library yield without compromising library quality in FFPE samples ranging from very poor quality to high quality. This combinatorial approach allows even the poorest quality FFPE samples to achieve high quality libraries with sufficient input for hybrid capture in our study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/20fe9718-b172-4a90-83a6-9bf61d2a8b7e\/@C03B8ZSS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor biology,Somatic mutations,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Mutation detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18796"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Margaret R.

Pembrolizumab has recently been approved by the FDA for use in patients with high TMB. However low TMB patients are not considered good responders and could benefit from stratification. The predictive value of other biomarkers such as intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) has been studied across a range of cancer indications. The utility of ITH in Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has not been established. Here we evaluate the relationship between ITH and outcome in early stage low TMB patients and explore differences in immune cell enrichment and predicted driver genes. Stratifying early stage patients may yield an opportunity to improve Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) and lower the risk of progression to late stage disease.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>All molecular data was obtained from the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas via the GDC Data Portal. Clinical data was from the PanCancer Atlas dataset through cBioPortal. We estimated ITH using PyClone, an algorithm that estimates the number of tumor clones. We generated our ITH values in triplicate across 3 separate days, yielding an average PyClone clone number. Clones with &#62;2 mutations were counted. We used p-value minimization to choose 1.4 for the TMB cutoff and 2.6 for the PyClone cutoff. We generated 4 groups: HTHI, HTLI, LTHI, and LTLI, where H - high, L- low, T-TMB, and I-ITH. Immune cell enrichment analysis was obtained from the xCell webtool. Driver gene prediction was performed with OncoDriveClust via the R package maftools.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We found a statistically significant difference in RFS between early stage (Stage I and Stage II) LTHI (N = 18) and LTLI (N = 40) patients (16.69 months vs. 33.27 months, p-value = 0.0056). Interestingly the predicted driver genes did not significantly differ between these two groups. One driver (EGFR) and two drivers (EGFR and TP53) genes were predicted for LTHI and LTLI, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis showed statistically significant differences in key immune subtypes. B-cells were depressed and Th1 cells were elevated in LTHI, both of which are associated with poorer survival outcomes.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We found an association between high ITH and poor survival in low TMB early stage LUAD patients. Early stage patients can be stratified using heterogeneity metrics like PyClone.

Gliomas are clinically separated by mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes, but all subtypes have an altered energy metabolism. Mitochondria are essential cellular organelles that mediate many biological processes associated with tumorigenesis, such as energy metabolism and cell death, that can be impacted by mitochondrial mutations and copy number. As part of the Glioma Longitudinal AnalyiSiS consortium, we characterized mitochondrial genome evolution in response to treatment, using whole-genome sequencing data and associated RNA sequencing data from 152 paired tumor samples from 76 patients. Mitochondrial mutations are unequally distributed across the mitochondrial glioma genome, with only 4 of 13 mtDNA genes harboring a mutation across the cohort. Previous consortium analyses have investigated nuclear DNA hypermutation and changes in aneuploidy in response to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Previous findings have identified hypermutation and copy number alterations as mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in glioma, but did not include analyses on mitochondrial DNA. Our analysis identified key differences between mitochondrial genome evolution and nuclear genome evolution. The mitochondrial mutational burden was not correlated with an increase in nuclear mutational burden. Unlike the nuclear DNA, we did not observe any samples with treatment-associated hypermutation. Mitochondrial copy number varied greatly but was increased at recurrence in IDH wild-type tumors. In tumors with a mutation in the <i>IDH1<\/i> gene, mitochondrial copy number decreases were associated with an increase in aneuploidy score in samples that received radiation therapy. Expression analyses highlighted key differences in the active repair mechanisms between mtDNA and nuclear DNA. Our findings shed light on the variations in DNA repair mechanisms between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in glioma and lay the foundation for further analyses on the co-evolution of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in treatment-resistant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fb9d078a-5376-45de-be32-4d6deada6bc2\/@C03B8ZSS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Mitochondrial DNA,Tumor evolution,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18798"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Taylor E.

These GAs were associated with 8 pathways, including the cell cycle, TP53, NOTCH, PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR, RTK\/RAS\/RAF\/MEK, TGF-&#946;, &#946;-catenin\/WNT, and DNA remodeling pathways. The NGS-derived tumor mutational burden was 1.2 muts\/Mb (range 0-7.1) and no tumor exhibited a microsatellite-high signature. For actionability analysis, five patients harbored deleterious or likely deleterious mutations in HRR genes (1 <i>ARID1A<\/i>, 2 <i>ATM<\/i>, 1 <i>BRCA2<\/i>, 1 <i>RAD51C<\/i>) and thus their tumors might respond to PARP inhibitors, especially two patients with biallelic loss.

More than 31% of the LELC cases harbored at least one actionable GA, with five potential candidates for the treatment with FDA-approved drugs for other types of cancer, making the evaluation of these GAs as potential targets for LELC worth considering in future clinical trials. Given the limited treatment options in LELC patients, comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors by NGS has the potential to identify novel treatments for precision medicine in LELC management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/33041acb-3d3c-4e29-b211-78d05b74637e\/@C03B8ZSS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Genomic alteration,Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18799"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William C.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), different mechanisms of DDR deregulation have been identified, but a systematic investigation on DDR alterations is missing. To understand how the DDR pathways contribute to leukemogenesis, we studied the gene expression and mutational profiles of 274 DDR genes by analysing 539 AML cases profiled by whole genome (WGS) and RNA sequencing. WGS data were used to identify mutations in genes of the DDR and in a panel of genes known to be mutated in AML (n=73). Transcriptomic data were analysed through unsupervised clustering, differential expression and enrichment analysis. We detected 150 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 130 patients (24%, average 0.3 SNVs\/case). Genes mutated in more than 1% of cases were <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>BLM<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, <i>POLG<\/i> and <i>POLQ<\/i>. The most frequently altered pathway was the homologous recombination\/Fanconi Anemia (HR) pathway (29%), followed by the genes that coordinates the DDR pathway (20%). We detected a trend toward mutual exclusivity between mutations in <i>TP53<\/i> and mutations in genes of HR pathway or the genes that coordinates the DDR pathway (adj-p &#60;0.02). To further investigate the interplay between <i>TP53<\/i> mutations and the HR pathway, we analysed the expression profiles of HR genes in 539 patients. We identified two groups of patients having higher (HR-high) or lower (HR-low) expression levels of HR genes. A panel of 5 genes was able to discriminate patients between the two groups (<i>BRCA1, RAD54B, RMI2, UBE2T<\/i> and <i>XRCC2<\/i>; AUC=0.9). Enrichment analysis on differentially expressed genes and gene set enrichment analysis showed that the cell cycle pathway, together with the G2\/M transition\/mitotic phase, E2F targets and the fatty acid metabolism pathways were upregulated in HR-high patients, while the pRB, EZH2, RPS14 and HOXA9 pathways were downregulated. Moreover, we observed that AML expressing <i>CBFB-MYH1<\/i>, <i>RUNX1-RUNXT1<\/i> or carrying <i>RAD21<\/i> mutations had higher chances to express lower levels of HR genes (HR-low), while patients with <i>STAG2,<\/i> <i>SRSF2<\/i>, <i>U2AF1<\/i>, <i>FLT3<\/i>-ITD alterations had higher chances of having higher expression of HR genes (p&#60;0.05). <i>NPM1<\/i>-mutated cases without <i>FLT3<\/i>-ITD clustered within the HR-low profile (adj-p&#60;0.05), while <i>TP53<\/i> mutated cases tended to cluster in the HR-high group, although statistical significance was not reached. In conclusion, our data showed the presence of alterations in the DDR pathway that might be the reflection of driver events in AML. Functional studies will elucidate the functional impact of these alterations. The results suggested the presence of a therapeutic window that might be exploited with DDR inhibitors in molecularly-defined subgroups of patients.<br \/>Supported by the Torsten Haferlach-Leuk&#228;miediagnostik-Stiftung and AIRC IG 2019 (project 23810).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c9950bd8-3ec3-43fc-bf4a-47570e95260b\/@C03B8ZSS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Whole genome sequencing,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18800"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Antonella Padella<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephan Hutter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wencke Walter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Constance Baer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Azzali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Ghelli Luserna Di Rorà<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Ghetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorenzo Ledda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Paganelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Haferlach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wolfgang Kern<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgia Simonetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Martinelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Torsten Haferlach<\/i><\/presenter>.

Unlike other TCGA analysis, they were unable to identify prognostic mutational profiles outside of BRCA status. There has been limited characterization of the ovarian cancer genomic profile since. Our objective presented here was to perform whole exome and whole transcriptome analysis of 241 ovarian cancer samples and compare to the TCGA dataset. This is the first phase of a muti-step ongoing analysis wherein we will input and correlate the complete genomic profile, complete patient outcome data, and immunohistochemical staining into a multi-omic artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning model with the aim of improved individualized outcome prediction.<br \/>Methods: Tumor samples from 2000-2016 were obtained at time of surgery under approved University of Pittsburgh approved IRB consent. Whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing were performed in collaboration with Helomics Corporation.

The frequency and type of FGF\/FGFR aberrations are not well-characterized across invasive breast cancer subtypes and metastatic sites of disease. In hormone receptor positive breast cancers, FGFR1 amplification correlates with early progression on endocrine therapy and promotes resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibition. Our study evaluated the incidence and characterization of FGF alterations in invasive breast cancers and examined differences based on histologic subtype, molecular subtype and site.<br \/><b>METHODS <\/b>Breast cancer samples underwent molecular profiling by Caris Life Sciences. Analyses included NGS of DNA (592 Gene Panel, NextSeq, and WES, NovaSEQ), and IHC (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ).<i> <\/i>Biomarker results were compiled from cases within the breast cohort including data from any sequencing panel, gene expression\/RNA seq panel, and IHC. All results listed below were statistically significant (p &#60; 0.05) as determined by chi-square test and Benjamini Hochberg correction.<br \/><b>RESULTS <\/b>12058 breast cancer tumors were analyzed: 4189 from primary breast specimens (35%) and 7869 from metastatic sites (65%). 4305 (36%) were ductal and 671 (6%) were lobular histology with remaining other\/unknown. 6413 (53%) were HR+HER2-, 3504 (29%) were triple negative, 403 (3%) were HR+HER2+ and 363 (3%) were HR-HER2+ with 1375 (13%) of unknown subtype. In the entire cohort, the most commonly amplified genes were FGF19 (11.49%), FGF3 (10.75%), FGF4 (9.98%), CCND1 (12.36%), and FGFR1 (9.08%). FGFR1-4 amplification was present in 11.01% of all cases. FGF19 amplification was more prevalent in lobular breast cancer compared to ductal (12.1% vs 9.1%). FGF19, FGF23, FGF3, FGF4, FGF6 amplification varied across molecular subtypes being most prevalent in HR+\/HER2- (15.7%), HR+\/HER2+ (12.1%), and least prevalent in HR-\/HER+ tumors (3.4%). FGFR1 amplification was most common among FGFR1-4 amplifications and most prevalent in HR+HER2- (12%). Across metastatic sites, FGF ligands displayed different patterns of amplification with FGF19, FGF3 and FGF4 amplification most prevalent in liver and bone metastases. FGFR1 amplification was statistically different across metastatic sites and most prevalent in liver metastases (16%) followed by bone (10%). Patients receiving CDK4\/6 inhibitors with FGFR1 amplification had shorter time on treatment than FGFR1 wild type (HR = 0.892, p = 0.03).<br \/><b>CONCLUSION <\/b>FGF alterations in invasive breast cancers vary by molecular subtype and site of disease. FGFR1, FGF19, FGF23, FGF3, FGF4, and FGF6 amplifications were statistically different across subtypes (most prevalent in HR+\/HER2- and HR+\/HER2+) and metastatic sites (most prevalent in liver and bone metastases).

The rarity of appendiceal neoplasms has made it difficult to conduct prospective or randomized clinical trials to guide therapy for these tumors; this issue is confounded by the fact that much heterogeneity exists between multiple histopathologic subtypes. Low-grade and high-grade appendiceal tumors have marked contrast in the natural history (5-year OS 68% for low-grade vs. 7% for high-grade) and response to chemotherapy. Here we perform RNA sequencing to systematically evaluate key molecular differences between high-grade and low-grade appendiceal tumors with the goal of identifying new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in each.<br \/>Methods: Whole transcriptomic RNA sequences (n = 12) of appendiceal adenocarcinomas (AA) patients&#8217; FFPE tissues from MD Anderson Cancer Center were collected. STAR Alignment pipeline was first conducted to raw RNA-seq to generate the gene count matrix of the patients. Unsupervised clustering of the AA samples based on Euclidean-distance and Wald&#8217;s method was generated. The cohort was then divided into high-grade (n = 6) and low-grade tumor (n = 6) groups and differential gene expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 and edgeR R packages. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with hallmark and C6 gene sets was implemented to study the up\/down-regulation patterns of the gene pathway in each AA cohort.<br \/>Results: Unsupervised clustering of high and low-grade tumors showed clear separation by grade, with well and moderately differentiated tumors clustering separately from high-grade appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Differences in gene expression between high-grade and low-grade tumors identified that TNFa signaling via NFkB (NES = 2.23, FDR q-val &#60; 0.01), MYC (NES = 1.98, FDR q-val &#60; 0.01), P53 pathway (NES = 1.96, FDR q-val &#60; 0.01), E2F (NES = 1.86, FDR q-val &#60; 0.01) and KRAS upregulated gene set (NES = 1.38, FDR q-val = 0.068) were enriched in high-grade relative to low-grade tumors; Myogenesis (NES = -1.48, FDR q-val = 0.06) and Spermatogenesis (NES = -1.47, FDR q-val = 0.05) were depleted in high-grade relative to low-grade tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the appendiceal tumor grades are critical to help guide towards better treatments of each subgroup. Both unsupervised clustering analysis and GSEA show different gene expression patterns between high-grade and low-grade appendiceal adenocarcinomas. Given appendiceal adenocarcinoma is a rare and heterogeneous tumor, tumor-grade-specific prognostic-predictive factors are pending investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0b9b22ae-1ddb-41bc-b9c3-94402dbd52cd\/@D03B8ZST\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression analysis,Appendix Cancer,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18806"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yue Gu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdelrahman M.

It is approved by the FDA as a companion diagnostic (CDx) for identifying approved therapeutic treatments for KRAS G12\/G13 wild-type variants in CRC, and EGFR L858R variants and exon 19 in-frame deletions for NSCLC. oRDx-LCCA can detect non-CDx variants such as EGFR T790M, G719X and exon 20 insertions in NSCLC and KRAS Q61X and A146T and BRAF V600E in CRC. Variants are detected using Pillar Biosciences&#8217; proprietary PiVAT&#174; (Pillar Variant Analysis Toolkit) software.<br \/>Methods: DNA input range was evaluated at 6 concentrations between 5 - 160ng in duplicate using DNA extracted from 15 clinical FFPE samples containing SNVs and INDELs from representative targeted mutations. Accuracy was determined by comparing detected variants with an externally validated comparator (CompO) across 208 samples (84 CRC, 124 NSCLC). Limit of detection (LoD) was determined by serial dilution of KRAS, EGFR, or BRAF positive FFPE samples in normal DNA to detect variant allele frequency (VAF) between 1 - 10%. Reproducibility tests were performed across 3 sites, 9 runs, 6 operators, 3 reagent lots and 3 thermocyclers, resulting in a total of 360 libraries. The non-inferiority (NI) statistical test was used to compare the oRDx-LCCA with an FDA approved CDx assay for EGFR exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations (CompQ) and for KRAS G12\/G13 mutations (CompC). Synthetic FASTQ files were created at VAFs above and below the variant detection threshold for CDx mutations and used to validate quality control parameters, mean coverage, and on-target rate.<br \/>Results: Effective DNA input range was determined to be between 10 - 80ng. LoD&#8217;s for KRAS G12\/G13, EGFR L858 and exon 19 deletion, and BRAF V600E were established at &#60; 4%. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) between oRDx-LCCA and CompO were &#62; 99% each. Across all variables tested for reproducibility, the average percent positive agreement (APA) and average percent negative agreement (ANA) were each &#62; 95%. NI margin was calculated to be &#60; 10% between oRDx-LCCA and CompQ across all NSCLC samples and between oRDx-LCCA and CompC across all CRC samples. A total of 61 synthetic FASTQ datasets were created to validate the functionality and accuracy of PiVAT including VAF thresholds for 126 SNV and INDEL CDx variants.<br \/>Conclusion: oRDx-LCCA is a highly accurate FDA approved IVD assay and PiVAT is a powerful FDA approved software tool for the detection of clinically relevant KRAS variants in CRC and EGFR variants in NSCLC and determination of approved therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/74d2ec8a-7b73-4934-aca9-9fd2965315de\/@D03B8ZST\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Colon cancer,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18807"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gloria Chan Johnson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Aldersley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Lodato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamie Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Flockhart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Urbin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yue Ke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean Polvino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Zillmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gang Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaohui Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Solid tumors have high cell density and poor lymphatic drainage, leading to higher interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). We previously showed that the tumor microenvironment of poorly-differentiated (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) can be selectively and effectively treated with nanomedicine carrying recombinant human Tumor Necrosis Factor &#945; (TNF&#945;)(CYT6091), resulting in vascular leakage, decreased IFP, and increased intratumoral concentration of paclitaxel <i>in vivo<\/i>. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanisms involved in a TNF&#945;-induced reduction of IFP. We investigated the effects of TNF-&#945; on cytokines and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in tumor microenvironment. Our data showed that TNF&#945; treatment downregulated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#946;) and Lysyl oxidase (LOX) and upregulated several ECM proteins. However, we observed LOX upregulation when we treated thyroid cancer with siTNF-&#945;-receptor 1 or 2 followed by TNF-&#945;, suggesting the involvement of TNF-&#945;-receptors in treatment resistance. In addition to the role of LOX in stiffening the ECM, causing a barrier to drug delivery, we showed overexpression of LOX in aggressive thyroid cancer. We observed increased vascular leakage in siLOX-treated thyroid cancer xenografts, mimicking the effect of CYT-6091. Furthermore, we confirmed that the <i>LOX <\/i>expression in thyroid cancer is positively associated with transforming growth factor receptor 1 (<i>TGFBR1<\/i>). In TCGA thyroid cancer database the mRNA expression of <i>TGFBR1<\/i> was positively correlated with those of ECM regulatory genes (<i>ITGB2,<\/i> <i>ITGA2 and<\/i> <i>COL1A1<\/i>) which were downregulated with TNF-&#945; treated thyroid cancer cells. To assess the role of TGF-&#946; on vascular permeability, we found that the TGF-&#946; inhibitor (SB-431542) induced <i>in vitro <\/i>vascular leakage, while the recombinant TGF-&#946; reversed TNF-&#945;-induced <i>in vitro <\/i>vascular leakage in HUVEC cells.

Sets of transcriptional factors bring together multiple CREs, which can be up to megabases away, to initiate and maintain the gene expression. How to measure the activity of CREs and their coordination with the genetic variants over large genomic distances to regulate gene expression is the central question for regulatory genomics, which is still limited by the current sequencing approaches. We report a method, TAGMe-seq, which simultaneously captures the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), chromosome conformation, DNA methylation, and GpC methyltransferase footprints from a single molecule, together with transcriptome in the same assay.To demonstrate the performance of TAGMe-seq, we applied it to the IMR-90 and GM12878 cell lines, both of which have been comprehensively profiled publically. TAGMe-seq showed high concordances with the state-of-art mono-omics assays across all the molecular measurements at the same cell types. We next asked if the genomic regions linearly separated but positioned proximity in space would have coordinated footprint status. We analyzed the GCH (H=A, C, or T) methyltransferase footprint on TAGMe-seq reads separated in chromatin loop anchors. Indeed, the GCH methyltransferase footprint in TAGMe-seq read pairs mapping to separated loop anchors showed a significantly higher correlation than that in the shuffled read pairs from the same genomic regions. To further demonstrate the utility of TAGMe-seq, we utilized it to analyze the long-range (&#62;1kb) allele-specific GpC methyltransferase footprint. We separated TAGMe-seq reads into two groups by their parent-of-origin at the heterozygous SNPs (SNP anchors). Naturally, the other ends of the read pairs were also separated into two alleles, even though they are not overlapped with the SNPs and mapped over large genomic distances (non-SNP anchors). Thus, we are able to analyze the long-range allele-specific GCH methyltransferase footprint. We identified three groups of allele-specific footprint loci based on their differences of GCH accessibility between the two alleles at both anchors, or only at SNP anchors, or only at non-SNP anchors, which showed distinct enrichment levels of TF binding. Overall, combining multiple assays in TAGMe-seq allowed us to uncover the coordinated GpC methyltransferase footprint and long-range allele-specific footprint at genomic regions that are far away in linear DNA sequences but spatially close in the nucleus, which will eventually pave the road to dissect the mechanisms of gene-regulatory aberrations in complex diseases, such as cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1a3f371c-d986-4978-9e7d-a169119a81a3\/@D03B8ZST\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,3D genome,GpC methyltransferase footprints,Cis-regulatory elements,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18809"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hailu Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haizi Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louis J.

Mutations in these genes are candidates for novel mTOR inhibitors, such as nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-sirolimus, which have already demonstrated clinical efficacy in isolated case studies of patients with mutations in the mTOR pathway. However, the incidence of <i>TSC1 <\/i>and <i>TSC<\/i>2<i> <\/i>mutations in the US and its distribution across tumors has not yet been systematically reported. Moreover, existing models for calculating incidence of targetable mutations do not account for cross-eligibility for other clinically approved targets. Therefore, here, we describe the landscape of <i>TSC1 <\/i>and <i>TSC2<\/i> mutations across 16 solid tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; <i>n<\/i> = 9,808 patients) and AACR GENIE database (MSK: <i>n = <\/i>14,340 patients, DFCI: <i>n <\/i>= 5,271 patients) and estimate the annual incidence of eligible patients using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database. We then refined these estimates by excluding patients eligible for immunotherapy (tumor mutational burden (TMB) <u>&#62;<\/u> 10 mutations\/Mb) and other targeted therapies (<i>n <\/i>= 23 FDA-approved drug-targetable mutations). We find that the combined US incidence of patients with truncations (e.g. frameshift, nonsense, splice-site) or deep copy number deletions in <i>TSC1<\/i> and <i>TSC2 <\/i>is ~11,000 &#177; 1,000 (mean Spearman <i>&#961;<\/i> across datasets: 0.92). About 40% of these patients have mutations in at least one of 23 other drug-targetable genes. <i>TSC1<\/i> and <i>TSC2<\/i> mutations were most frequent in bladder and hepatobiliary cancers, respectively, with the absolute prevalence of mutations being highest in bladder and non-small-cell lung cancer. Among the patients with <i>TSC1<\/i> and <i>TSC2<\/i> mutations with other targetable mutations, we identified the most common co-occurring targetable mutations with <i>TSC1 <\/i>and <i>TSC2<\/i>, suggesting that combination or sequential treatment with immunotherapy and <i>BRAF<\/i> and <i>FGFR3<\/i> inhibitors are possible options for clinical trials. Finally, we show that the combined annual US incidence of patients with <i>TSC1<\/i> and <i>TSC2<\/i> mutations is on average (<i>n <\/i>= 3 clinical genomic cohorts) higher than 17 of 23 other common targetable mutations. Our approach is now being used to estimate the population size of other medically relevant mutations and identify associated genomic targets for improved clinical trial design.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/31ba5883-454b-4dc1-86e0-e2e92217bcc8\/@D03B8ZST\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,AACR Project GENIE,TSC,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18811"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gunsagar S.

However, the incidence of genetic predisposition and germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in Korean pancreatic cancer patients has not been well investigated. Therefore we studied to identify the clinical characteristics of the causative gene mutations and incidence of PV for future treatment strategies in pancreatic cancer.<br \/>Methods: Total of 283 (145 male and 138 female) patients were enrolled in National Cancer Center in Korea (IRB no. NCC2019-0034, NCC2021-0338) and their median age was 67 years (range: 33-90). Resectable (25.1%), borderline resectable or locally advanced (25.5%), and metastatic (46.3%) stages were included. Germline hereditary cancer panel tests with 28 genes and <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> gene were done in 97.2% (n=275) and 2.8% (n=8) of patients, respectively.<br \/>Results: PVs were detected in 17 patients (median age 64, range 49-80) in <i>ATM<\/i> (n=5, 29.4%), <i>BRCA1<\/i> (n=3, 17.6%), <i>BRCA2<\/i> (n=2, 11.8%), <i>RAD51D<\/i> (n=2, 11.8%), <i>TP53<\/i> (n=1, 5.9%), <i>PALB2<\/i> (n=1, 5.9%), <i>PMS2<\/i> (n=1, 5.9%), <i>RAD50<\/i> (n=1, 5.9%), and <i>SPINK1<\/i> (n=1, 5.9%). Eight patients (4 <i>ATM<\/i> PVs, 2 <i>BRCA1<\/i> 1 <i>BRCA2<\/i>, 1 <i>PALB2<\/i> PV) presented various type of cancers in their families and three patients with ATM PVs showed pancreatic cancer in their first degree relatives. Nine patients without family cancer history represented median age as 66 (49-80) which was not significantly different of those with family history as 63 (51-75).<br \/>Conclusions: This study showed 6.0% of incidence of germline PVs in Korean pancreatic cancer patients. Though we still don&#8217;t have guidelines for germline predisposition gene test in pancreatic cancer patients in Korea, this result showed that the incidence of PVs were comparable with that of the country which have recommendation to do genetic tests for all pancreatic cancer patients. To expand our knowledge for the incidence and involving genes of cancer predisposition for Korean pancreatic cancer patients, further analysis in larger number of patients is needed.

Moreover, synchronous multiple pancreatic cancers were often reported. One of the long-standing issues about such synchronous and\/or metachronous multiple pancreatic cancers is their clonal origins. In this study, we aimed to reveal the origin of multiple pancreatic cancers using an unbiased detection of somatic mutations in primary and metachronous cancers as well as adjacent precursor lesions.<br \/>[Methods] Serially obtained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from 17 patients who had undergone curative surgery for an early-stage pancreatic cancer were subjected to laser microdissection for the enrichment of tumor and precancerous lesions, from which DNA was extracted and analyzed for somatic mutations using whole-exome sequencing (WES) with matched normal DNA. Based on shared and private mutations across different samples, we interrogated history of clonal evolution of these lesions.<br \/>[Results] We analyzed 17 patients with multiple pancreatic cancers of 2 metachronous and synchronous, 10 metachronous, and 2 synchronous tumors. In metachronous cases, pathology for primary cancer were margin-negative in all patients, and the median interval between the initial and second surgery was 37.7 months (12 - 85 months). In addition, we analyzed 5 adjacent pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) in one of these cases. We identified a median of 66 (range: 31-232) and 20 (14-42) somatic mutations in cancer and PanIN lesions, respectively. None of the patients have known pathogenic germline variants. All samples had one or more driver mutations. In most cases (N=16), sharing many somatic mutations, multiple tumors had a common clonal origin. In another synchronous case, the synchronous tumors shared only one mutation, suggesting that they were clonally independent tumors. By contrast, none of the mutations other than hotspot KRAS mutations were shared between precursor and cancer lesions. While multiple independent clones were observed in precancerous lesions, most of multiple cancers originated from a common ancestor. Moreover, negative pathology of the margins at the initial surgery suggested that those multiple lesions arose from distant dissemination or metastasis, rather than contiguous, intraductal invasion.<br \/>[Conclusions] In conclusion, our study suggests that even early pancreatic cancer might be disseminated within the pancreas and contribute to synchronous and metachronous cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d57339ca-6c8e-453e-a399-c29dfcb7793e\/@D03B8ZST\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19034"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tomonori Hirano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nobuyuki Kakiuchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takeuchi Yasuhide<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomomi Nishimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshihiko Masui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuyuki Nagai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takayuki Anazawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sachiko Minamiguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hironori Haga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norimitsu Uza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Seno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuzo Kodama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atsuhiro Masuda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takeshi Tanaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuichi Shiraishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoru Miyano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seishi Ogawa<\/i><\/presenter>.

In recent years, clinicopathological characteristics of GC are changing, marked by increasing incidence of gastric signet ring cell carcinoma (GSRCC) histology. However, at present, no effective therapeutic targets for GSRCC. Fusion genes are considered as ideal therapeutic targets for various cancers with the development of sequencing technique. We attempted to target fusion genes to treat GSRCC.<br \/>Methods: We used STAR-Fusion, STAR-Seqr, Arriba to get fusion genes in 417 GC samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Fusion genes identified simultaneously by at least two software are considered &#8220;real&#8221; fusion genes. Next, we included 556 GC samples of our specimen bank, including 64 GSRCC in this study. All histopathologic diagnoses were reviewed by at least two senior pathologists independently. Clinical information was retrospectively collected and the overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of surgery to the date of death or the last follow-up visit. Formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue were collected for next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a 450-gene panel assay.<br \/>Results: Among 417 GC samples in TCGA, we detected fusion genes in 283 (68%) samples. On average, each GC samples contained 7 fusion genes. And, a single sample contained a maximum of 85 fusion genes. We noticed that one GC sample had FGFR2-TACC2 fusion, which is recurrent and meaningful in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and urothelium carcinoma. On the other hand, among 556 GC samples from our specimen bank, GSRCC patients had lower tumor mutation burden (TMB-L) (P=0.001) than non-SRCC patients. However, we detected gene fusions in 20.3% (13\/64) GSRCC patients. GSRCC patients with gene fusions had a higher N stage (P=0.001) and a higher tumor stage (P=0.010) defined by 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AICC) criterion. Moreover, GSRCC patients harboring gene fusions (n=9) had poorer overall survival (OS) in comparison with patients without any gene fusion (n=19) (16.0 months vs 21.0 months, P=0.043). In addition, FGFR2 gene fusions (FGFR2-VTI1A and TACC2-FGFR2) were recurrently detected in 3.1% GSRCC tumor samples. We stably expressed TACC2-FGFR2 in gastric cancer cell lines. Using qRT-PCR, we found FGFR2 mRNA levels were increased in TACC2-FGFR2-expressing GC cells and IHC showed TACC2-FGFR2 upregulated FGFR2 protein expression in TACC2-FGFR2-expressing GC cells. Also, TACC2-FGFR2-expressing GC cells were more sensitive to FGFR2 inhibitors.<br \/>Conclusions: Our observation revealed that fusion genes were recurrent in GSRCC and might associate to shorter OS. FGFR2 fusion genes were recurrent in GSRCC and FGFR2 inhibitors might be a new therapeutic target for GSRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2158622-e1d1-481a-84b0-f89ef3d4343e\/@D03B8ZST\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Signet ring cell carcinoma,Fusion genes,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  (FGFR-2),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19035"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yue Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinwei Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lixia Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nandie Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baorui Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jia Wei<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus gene fusions, nonsense mutations and gene deregulation are key contributors to oncogenic phenotypes. Certain genomic translocations have been linked to cancer subtypes, such BCR&#8212;ABL1 for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) serving as potential onco-biomarkers. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the rarest and most lethal subtype of breast cancer with a 5-year survival rate below 50%. Ethnic disparities for breast cancer exist; negative estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) hormone receptor status is more frequent in Hispanic and African American women. In addition, inflammatory breast cancer lacks defined molecular markers limiting its early onset detection which leads to poorer overall prognosis. Thus, we hypothesized that profiling IBC translocations, including its subtypes, show valuable insights to better understand this complex disease. We developed MANGO, a pipeline that leverages STAR, STAR-Fusion, FusionInspector, and Trinity to identify, visualize and assemble gene fusions from IBC sequencing data. Using the SUM149PT cell line as a model for IBC, we identified and experimentally validated a model fusion gene ZDHHC5&#8212;EPB41L5. Fusion unaware sequence assemblies cross-validated the fusion and its multiple splice sites, one of which encodes a fusion peptide. Differential gene expression between SUM149PT and SUM190PT, an IBC cell line without evidence for the identified translocation, showed loss of expression of ZDHHC5 but no change in EPB41L5, suggesting the latter retained its expression in its new genomic localization. Furthermore, in-silico functional predictions for experimental results reveals an in-frame fusion peptide with transmembrane signals in EPB41L5. Genomic translocation mapping reveals triple-negative IBC diverges from traditional breast cancer translocation patterns. In short, MANGO serves as a powerful tool to identify biologically significant translocations involved in IBC and other cancer classifications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/93a2f9a9-38d6-4475-a7ad-10c2abe986d1\/@v03B8ZSU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Translocation,Inflammatory breast cancer,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19036"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carlos S.

In this study we evaluated the performances by the MGISEQ-2000 sequencer in DNA methylation sequencing, using Illumina&#8217;s NovaSeq6000 as a benchmark.<br \/>Materials and Methods: We performed both genome-wide methylation profiling and targeted methylation sequencing on reference DNA and clinical DNA samples. To minimize non-platform discrepancies, we prepared 2 libraries, one for NovaSeq600 and the other for MGISEQ-2000, from each DNA sample using the same experimental protocol except the last step, when we used indexed primers whose sequences and chemical modification are compatible with either NovaSeq600 or MGISEQ-2000 to amplify the corresponding library. We conducted standardized analyses on MGISEQ-2000&#8217;s reads quality, sequence bias, genome alignment and coverage, regional depth, limits of detection (LOD), etc. We compared methylation levels at CpG sites, and measurements of methylation haplotypes to assess the consistency in mapping and quantifying genome-wide and regional methylation by MGISEQ-2000 and between the 2 platforms. Furthermore, we analyzed inter-platform variations in classifying normal and malignant plasma DNA samples using targeted methylation sequencing data from either platform exclusively.<br \/>Results: We prepared and sequenced libraries from over 100 DNA samples of normal or malignant tissue or blood samples for comparison, in addition to reference DNA. Overall, MGISEQ-2000 displayed high level of consistency, and little-to-no sequence bias in methylation sequencing. At genome-wide, regional, and individual-CpG levels, MGISEQ-2000 demonstrated high degree of concordance with NovaSeq6000 in quantifying DNA methylation, as the inter-platform Pearson correlation coefficients were consistently above 0.90 or higher for both targeted sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, regardless of whether average methylation level (AMF) or methylation haplotype-specific metrics such as Methylation Haplotype Load (MHL) were used to quantify methylation. Additionally, MGISEQ-2000 is as sensitive as NovaSeq6000 at detecting spik-in methylation controls, as both reached an LOD of 0.1%. Lastly, MGISEQ-2000 produced similar results in classifying normal and malignant samples as NovaSeq6000, suggesting it had minimal distortion on the NovaSeq6000-based classifier.<br \/>Conclusions: MGISEQ-2000 demonstrated comparable data quality, methylation-calling accuracy, and consistency as NovaSeq6000 in DNA methylation sequencing, supporting its application in future investigation on DNA methylation as cancer biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55b6e2dc-9829-436b-ba78-be2c452f3dad\/@v03B8ZSU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sequencing,Methylation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19037"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mingyang Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianhua Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Xia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chengcheng Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhixi Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiye He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Rui Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In the oral cancer milieu, inflammation and stemness has been demonstrated to be cooperative during carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that differences in inflammation, stemness, and EMT might distinguish lesion and adjacent normal mucosa in our RNA Seq data on preneoplastic lesions. Once candidate genes are identified they might be applied to other oral mucosal specimens to identify risk for malignancy development.<br \/>Materials and Methods: We collected lesion and adjacent normal mucosal tissues from 16 subjects with high risk leukoplakia and early oral cancer (T1N0 and T2N0). Sequencing libraries were generated using the Illumina Truseq Stranded mRNA library prep kit. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina Hiseq 3000 instrument with paired-end 75bp read and sequenced to an overall depth of 30 million reads per sample.<br \/>Results: After developing a biospecimen collection procedure that functions in the senior author&#8217;s clinic flow, we were able to isolate sequenceable total RNA from 100% of the specimens we collected. We identified several hundred differentially expressed genes between lesion and adjacent normal. With regard to stemness, inflammation, and EMT we multiple candidate genes that could be incorporated into a limited gene set for further studies.

Therefore, it lacks targeted therapies, resulting in the worst prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Chromosome 4p (chr4p) loss is recurrent in TNBC, correlates with poor prognosis, is an early event in tumor evolution, and confers a proliferative advantage onto cells. Here, we propose that chr4p loss can be leveraged as a genetic vulnerability of TNBC by identifying its specific synthetic lethal (SL) genetic interactions. An SL interaction occurs when the inactivation of individual genes is tolerated, however, the combined inactivation of the corresponding genes leads to a loss of cellular viability. SL interactions offer promising avenues for precision oncology therapeutic strategies of TNBC. We leveraged the publicly available CRISPR-mediated genome-wide gene inactivation screens (DepMap project) dataset to computationally predict pairwise SL interactions that are specific to individual genes within chr4p, as well as complex SL genetic interactions involving multiple genes spanning large segments of chr4p and the entire chromosome arm. We developed regression models to compare the inactivation effect of a given SL partner gene, between cell lines that harbor chr4p loss and those characterized by a copy-neutral status of chr4p, while effectively accounting for potential confounding effects. We integrated the putative SL interactions identified from these regression models with those identified using other methods, drugZ and MAGECK, therefore, resulting in a robust set of putative SL interactions. We have prioritized the SL interactions for their subsequent experimental validation in TNBC PDX-derived 2D and 3D cell models, which we will carry out using CRISPR-based gene editing. The prediction model and collective set of SL candidates identified in this study is a unique resource for the development of SL-based therapeutic strategies for TNBC and other cancers harboring chr4p loss.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/53a873b2-232d-4a10-9a87-635c5eea7949\/@v03B8ZSU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Aneuploidy,Synthetic lethality,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21674"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rohan Dandage<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Schwartz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lynn Karam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Traver Hart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Kuzmin<\/i><\/presenter>.

GBM tumours include diverse populations of malignant and non-neoplastic cells with distinct molecular capabilities and with differential levels of sensitivity to treatment. Understanding the cell dynamics that occur during the development of GBM resistance to therapy could reveal key aspects of this process, including how resistance is acquired in time and how the diverse cell types of the tumour microenvironment (TME) contribute to this phenotype. In addition to the role of the TME, GBM exhibits significant tumour heterogeneity with diverse genetic clones coexisting in the same tumor, as well as cells with similar genetic backgrounds capable of adopting distinct transcriptional states and subtypes. The complex and dynamic interactions between tumor and TME remain to be fully studied. This work focuses on the in vivo spatial organization in GBM during disease progression. We generated spatial transcriptomic data from a set of adult GBM samples grown as patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, profiled at different time points of the disease. Three PDX lines from one GBM patient (derived from tumor core, vascularized area, and infiltrating front) were used to recapitulate the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity observed in the human disease. Two replicates from each of 8 PDX mice were collected from early, mid, and late time points of tumour growth and data was generated using the 10X Genomics Visium platform. We developed a robust computational pipeline capable of distinguishing admixture of human (tumour) and mouse cells (TME), using state-of-the-art tools. Human and mouse cell types and states were identified using pooled and separate single-cell references of human GBM states, and mouse brain cells from both normal and tumour conditions. With this approach we observe spatially distinct patterns of both (a) tumour infiltration patterns specific to the each PDX line that includes non-random distribution of GBM transcriptional states and genetic clones, and (b) spatially distinct infiltration of TME components including microglial and macrophage populations. Overall, our approach addresses the challenge of understanding the tumor-TME relationship by application of spatial profiling in PDX models, and provides a computational pipeline complex multi-species analysis in the spatial transcriptomic field.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed890ac4-74c9-420d-8993-124bb046d941\/@v03B8ZSU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Bioinformatics,Spatial Transcriptomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21711"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aly O.

Here we combine optical mapping and whole genome sequencing to explore in-depth the nature of structural variants (SVs) induced by replication stress in cyclin-activated hepatocellular carcinomas (CCN-HCC). In addition to classical tandem duplications, CCN-HCC display frequent intra- and inter-chromosomal templated insertion cycles (TIC) likely resulting from template switching events. Template switching preferentially involves active topologically associated domains that are close in the 3D genome organization. Template sizes depend on the type of cyclin activation and are coordinated within each TIC. Replication stress induces continuous accumulation of SVs during CCN-HCC progression, fostering the acquisition of new driver alterations and large-scale copy-number changes at TIC borders. Together, this analysis sheds light on the mechanisms, dynamics and consequences of SV accumulation in tumors with oncogene-induced replication stress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ab10c90-f50e-4ebb-8875-273ae959cbbb\/@v03B8ZSU\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Chromosomal instability,DNA replication stress,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20099"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Quentin Bayard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre Cordier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camille Péneau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandrine Imbeaud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theo Z.

However, current monitoring tools such as tumor markers and imaging methods have limited prognostic performance. Circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) could be a useful biomarker for monitoring patients with CRC. In this study, we evaluated the targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel using ctDNA in monitoring clinical decision-making in CRC.<br \/>Experimental Design: We prospectively enrolled 100 CRC patients and collected 197_ plasma samples. Specimens were collected post-surgery from 74 patients, 42 of whom were also monitored during the immediate post-surgery and adjuvant therapy follow-up. Twenty-six patients&#8217; bloods were received after adjuvant therapy without surgery. A total of patients performed ultra-deep sequencing of CRC-related 14 genes respectively and matched with tissue samples at the time of blood collection as possible. NGS results were assessed correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics and clinical outcome.<br \/>Results: Levels of ctDNA measurements were correlated with tumor stage. Stage IV patients had significantly higher ctDNA concentration than Stage I patients. ctDNA testing detected 112 alterations in 14 genes were identified in 69% of the patients (n=100). The results showed that APC (29%), TP53 (25%), KRAS (19%), and EGFR (5%) were the most frequently mutated genes. RAS family gene mutations were detected in 37 patients, yielding a concordance of 89% with tissue samples. Also, ctDNA detection was found to be a greater predictive performance when compared with CEA. Dynamics of ctDNA mutation levels reflected five follow-up patients&#8217; clonal evolution and clinical outcomes. These data showed ctDNA is a sensitive monitoring biomarker for any clinical condition of the patients.<br \/>Conclusions: The present study suggests that the use of ctDNA in CRC patients can be a valuable non-invasive monitoring tool for monitoring disease states during or after treatment. Serial ctDNA testing can contribute to improving patient management through monitoring disease progression and clonal evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d00d8510-c131-4d5a-9eba-b46e21d5d9a4\/@v03B8ZSU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,ctDNA,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20101"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hyeonah Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Doo A Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jieun Seo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saeam Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han Sang Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joong Bae Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung-Tae Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jong Rak Choi<\/i><\/presenter>.

In 2020, there were 19.29 million new cancer patients and a total of 10 million deaths. Drug are the most popular ways to control the development of cancer, but the effectiveness of anti-tumor drugs is only about 25%. Drug efficacy is affected by many factors, among which the most critical is genetic variants. Genomic analysis based on large-scale population sequencing was performed to calculate the mutation frequency of antineoplastic drug-related genetic variations and systematically analyze general descriptions and population differences.<br \/>Methods: Information of antineoplastic drugs is available from FDA and CFDA, and gene list comes from DrugBank, PharmGKB, FDA biomarker list and clinical guidelines. The maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the population mutation frequency of a single locus, and the calculation process was completed on Ali Cloud platform. GATK, ANNOVAR, PROVEAN, SIFT and other software were used for quality control, annotation and function prediction of mutations. Perl, Python, R and other computer languages were used for statistical analysis.<br \/>Results: we collect 206,604 samples from mainland China for analysis, and identified 104 antineoplastic drugs and 517 drug-related genes at the same time. There were 201,774 genetic variations, most of which were intron mutations, exon mutations account for about 1% of all mutations. We found 41,955 novel mutations, which unrecorded in dbSNP, accounting for about 20.8%. Most of these mutations were rare mutations with frequencies less than 1%, subsequent prediction of mutation function also indicated that a large proportion of these mutations were deleterious. These results suggest that rare mutations may also play an important role in the use of antineoplastic drugs, which has previously been underestimated. The mutation frequency distribution of different types of genes suggests that transporters have a greater impact on personalized medicine during the use of antineoplastic drugs in China. By analyzing the genetic variation of important metabolic enzymes, we found that mutations such as UGT1A1*6, DPYD*9A, CYP2D6*2 and *10 have a high frequency and high detection probability in the Chinese population. Therefore, when patients use drugs metabolized by related metabolic enzymes, genetic testing should be done in advance to prevent the occurrence of adverse reactions. Regional analysis revealed that the overall differences among provinces in China were small, but the differences were large compared with other ethnic groups.<br \/>Conclusion: Results of large-scale population sequencing reveal distribution and discipline of genetic variation of antineoplastic drug-related genes in Chinese population, further confirm the importance of precision medicine in cancer, and illustrate that the use of antineoplastic drugs can also be affected by ethnic differences.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/59802b9b-aaf8-4f29-ac32-e0cb8a48b641\/@v03B8ZSU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Genomics,Immune response,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20426"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yan Zhan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Ye Yin<\/i><\/presenter>.

EAC is characterized by a strong male predominance and racial disparity. EAC is up to five-fold more common among whites than Blacks, yet Black patients with EAC have poorer survival rates. The reason for the racial disparity is still largely unknown. Knowledge of somatic mutations in EAC from recent DNA sequencing studies have shown EAC has a high mutation burden and distinct mutational signatures. However, knowledge of mutations in EAC regarding racial disparities is limited.<br \/>Methods: In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of tumors obtained from 10 Black patients and 8 White patients with EAC. We performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by using subset of SNPs with FST&#62;0.2. We performed mutational signature analysis using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and R package MutationalPatterns. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare mutational signature contributions between racial groups and performed Fisher&#8217;s exact test to compare the gene-level somatic mutation counts between racial groups. All p-values were two sided and the significant level was 0.05.<br \/>Results: We identified 5,281 variants for the PCA and found principal component 1 (PC1) was strongly associated with race. We identified 94,482 somatic mutations and found 3 mutational signatures (A, B and C). &#8220;Signature A&#8221; was strongly correlated with Signature 19 (cosine-similarity: 0.80, unknown etiology), &#8220;Signature B&#8221; was strongly correlated with Signatures 4 and 29 (cosine-similarity: 0.78 and 0.80 respectively, etiology: smoking and chewing tobacco), and &#8220;Signature C&#8221; was strongly correlated with Signature 1 (cosine-similarity: 0.82, etiology: aging). There were no statistically significant differences of the 3 mutational signatures between tumors from black and white patients in EAC. When decomposing mutation count matrix into a sum of known components, we identified 25 COSMIC signatures, and found Signature12 (unknown etiology) shows more contribution in Black patients than in White patients and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.0008, q=0.02). For gene-level analysis, we found TP53 was the most frequently mutated in EAC patients and ARID1A and SMAD4 were the second group of driver genes. There was no statistically significant difference between the gene-level mutations among blacks and whites (Fisher exact test, P&#62;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: These results demonstrate that EAC from black patients are similar to cancers from white patients with respect to clinically actionable genomic alterations. Mutational signature 12 might be the characteristic gene mutation that contribute to the racial difference between Black and White EAC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/36b7a670-dcce-41a9-b01c-cbe9de08822c\/@v03B8ZSU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Mutational signature,Racial disparity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21770"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Spiridon Tsavachidis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Amos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron P.
