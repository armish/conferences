[{"Abstract":"<b>Objectives: <\/b>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a biological process characterized by a progressive decrease in epithelial features and increase in mesenchymal traits, has been suggested as a critical mechanism in cancer development. A defining feature of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin. Together with beta-catenin, alpha-catenin, and p120-catenin, E-cadherin forms the adherens junctions, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion of epithelial cells. As beta-catenin has both a structural and signaling role, E-cadherin potentially contributes to malignant progression via beta-catenin signaling through the Wnt pathway. E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression is altered from normal oral tissue, oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but there is no longitudinal research on the role of these biomarkers in malignant progression. The objective of this study is to explore the expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in OED and to determine if these expression patterns predict malignant progression.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>28 progressors (PR) and 56 non-progressors (NPR) were included in this case-control study. Samples that progressed to severe OED, carcinoma <i>in situ<\/i>, or OSCC were categorized as PRs, and samples that did not progress were NPRs. Patient samples with a baseline biopsy of low-grade (mild or moderate) OED and at least 5 years of follow-up for NPRs were obtained from the Oral Cancer Prediction Longitudinal study, which has been prospectively following patients with OED for over 20 years. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples to assess for reduced membranous E-cadherin, and reduced membranous and increased cytoplasmic and\/or nuclear beta-catenin expression in PRs compared to NPRs. We hypothesized that OED with this expression pattern will show greater likelihood of progression. Fisher&#8217;s exact test was used. Logistic regression will be performed to predict progression. <b>Results: <\/b>There were no significant differences in age, sex, risk of lesion site, and grade of dysplasia between PRs and NPRs. There were significant differences in length of follow-up time and smoking history. IHC has been completed on 27 samples to date, which show decreased membranous beta-catenin expression in PRs compared to NPRs (p=0.042). IHC for additional samples will be performed to assess for cytoplasmic and nuclear beta-catenin expression, and to compare expression patterns between PRs and NPRs to determine prediction of malignant progression.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Early results suggest that membranous beta-catenin expression may be decreased in OED that progressed compared to OED that did not. This research enhances the understanding of EMT&#8217;s role in malignant progression and hopes to potentially aid in the intervention of oral lesions at risk of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d79881b3-6f97-4fbe-a473-e9d052e7fcbd\/@x03B8ZT6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),E-cadherin,&#946;-catenin,dysplasia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17913"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ilena Yim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leigha Rock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lewei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miriam Rosin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Laronde<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this study, we investigated the clinical utility of a novel Patient-specific pROgnostic and Potential tHErapeutic marker Tracking (PROPHET) tumor-informed ctDNA assay.

Approximately 60% of patients with early-stage BC receive adjuvant treatment, however, only a small number derive a benefit. Recurrence remains a major obstacle. Comprehensive profiling analysis in early-stage (T1-2N0-1M0) BC with different disease subtypes might help understand the tumorigenesis mechanisms and pave the way to evaluate the recurrence risk in early-stage BC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A total of 418 patients diagnosed with early-stage BC were enrolled, including 82 patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) BC, 49 HR-\/HER2+ patients, 239 HR+\/HER2- patients, and 48 HR-\/HER2- patients. Capture-based targeted sequencing was performed on tumor tissue samples using a panel consisting of 520 cancer-related genes. The genomic profiling among different disease subtypes were investigated and tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Besides <i>HER2<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>CDK12<\/i>, and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> were the most frequently mutated genes in both HR2-\/HER2+ (75.5%, 65.3%, and 36.7%) and HR2+\/HER2+ BC (67.1%, 57.3%, and 36.6%). <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> were also the most frequently mutated gene in both HR-\/HER2- (22.9% and 81.3%) and HR+\/HER2- (54% and 23.4%) BC. Moreover, alterations in <i>KRAS <\/i>(12.5%) and <i>GATA3<\/i> (26.8%) were frequently occurred in HR-\/HER2- and HR+\/HER2- BC, respectively. Furthermore, a comparable TMB level was observed among four subtypes (median TMB: 3.0 mutations\/Mb for HR+\/HER2- BC; 3.7 mutations\/Mb for other subtypes). Next, the genomic profiling was compared between T1-2N0 and T1-2N1 disease in four subtypes, respectively. No different mutation frequencies in cancer-related genes were observed between T1-2N0 and T1-2N1 disease in both HR+\/HER2+ and HR-\/HER2- BC. In HR+\/HER2- BC, T1-2N1 disease had a higher mutation frequency of<i> TRRAP <\/i>(4% <i>vs. <\/i>0%<i>, <\/i>p&#60;0.05) and a lower mutation frequency in <i>CHD4 <\/i>(0% <i>vs.<\/i> 6%, p&#60;0.01), <i>ERBB3<\/i> (0% <i>vs.<\/i>5%, p&#60;0.05), and <i>CTCF <\/i>(1% <i>vs.<\/i>6%, p&#60;0.05) than T1-2N0 disease. In HR-\/HER2+ BC, patients with T1-2N1 disease had more alterations occurring in <i>HNF1B <\/i>(23% <i>vs. <\/i>0%, p&#60;0.05) and <i>CDK12 <\/i>(77% <i>vs.<\/i>48%, p&#60;0.05), and less alterations occurring in <i>NCOR1 <\/i>(0% <i>vs. <\/i>13%, p=0.096)<i> <\/i>than those with T1-2N0 disease.

Our previous studies showed increased SLPI with overexpressed NFX1-123 and co-expressed high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncogene (16E6) in primary keratinocytes (HFKs) as well as high SPLI levels in cervical cancers. The HR viral oncogenes E6 and E7 partner with host cell proteins to regulate cell cycle regulation and immortalization pathways. Understanding the mechanisms of SLPI upregulation in HPV-associated cancers is critical to validating SLPI as a non-invasive biomarker as well as to test its utility in future cancer treatments. This study was designed to quantify intracellular and secreted SLPI protein in cervical cancer and to determine the roles NFX1-123 and 16E6 have on SLPI expression and secretion.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Using HPV- and HPV+ cervical cancer cell lines and HFKs transduced with overexpressed NFX1-123 and 16E6, or vector controls, we measured intracellular and secreted SLPI by Western blot and ELISA, respectively. In HPV+ cervical cancer cell lines, NFX1-123 was knocked down or out by shRNA or CRISPR-Cas9, respectively, and 16E6 and 16E7 were knocked down by siRNA. In those cells, intracellular and secreted SLPI was quantified and the relative role of NFX1-123, 16E6, and 16E7 were studied. Selected classical and non-classical secretory pathways markers were also measured to assess their effects on SLPI secretion. Finally, SLPI&#8217;s concentration was measured by ELISA in cervical cancer patient sera and compared to healthy controls.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our results showed increased intracellular as well as secreted SLPI in HFKs with overexpressed NFX1-123 and 16E6. Similarly, we found increased SLPI secretion in HPV+ cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa, Caski and HeLa) when compared to HPV- C33A cells. A reduction in NFX1-123 and 16E6 led to decreased SLPI secretion, pointing to a regulation of SLPI by NFX1-123 and 16E6 on SLPI secretion. Analysis of classical and non-classical secretory pathway markers suggested that NFX1-123 regulated non-classical pathways, which may drive greater secretion of SLPI in HPV+ cervical cancers. Higher SLPI protein amounts were found cervical cancer patient sera when compared to healthy controls.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our results suggest a functional role for NFX1-123 and 16E6 in SLPI secretion in cervical cancer and that SLPI may be a potential biomarker in cervical cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6d0c2c74-9d7c-40fa-bda9-e86f7c79d253\/@y03B8ZT7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Infections and virus-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Human Papillomavirus,NFX1-123,Secretory Leukocyte Peptidase Inhibitor ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17918"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sreenivasulu Chintala<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Quist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Katzenellenbogen<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this large-scale spectroscopic study, we present the Dxcover&#174; Cancer Liquid Biopsy, the world&#8217;s first infrared spectroscopy-based blood test for the early detection of multiple cancers. The full cohort (<i>n<\/i>=2094) was comprised of patients with a confirmed cancer diagnosis (<i>n<\/i>=1543), symptomatic non-cancer patients (<i>n<\/i>=460) and healthy volunteers (<i>n<\/i>=91). For the cancer versus non-cancer classification, receiver operating characteristic analysis produced a mean curve with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.86. When adjusted for greater sensitivity, our model achieved 90% sensitivity with 61% specificity, and yielded a sensitivity of 56% with 91% specificity when tailored for higher specificity. We also tuned for maximized sensitivity or specificity, whilst the other parameter was fixed above a minimum value of 45% for the cross-validation result, based upon performance levels of currently available clinically benchmarked tests. This resulted in a 94% sensitivity where specificity was 47%, and a 94% specificity with 48% sensitivity. The overall detection rates were 93% for stage I, 84% for stage II, 92% for stage III and 95% for stage IV for the sensitivity-tuned model. The specificity-tuned model detected 90% of non-cancer patients accurately, resulting in few false negatives (54\/551). For the binary classifiers of individual cancer types against symptomatic control patients, promising AUC values were reported for all cancers: brain (0.90), breast (0.74), colorectal (0.91), kidney (0.91), lung (0.90), ovarian (0.85), pancreatic (0.81) and prostate (0.85). Importantly, the detection rates did not vary significantly according to cancer stage, suggesting the technology is very effective at detecting early-stage tumors, which is a necessity for MCED tests.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/00b1bfd3-980f-4ba1-9b34-21ebfda59219\/@y03B8ZT7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Liquid biopsies,Early detection,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17919"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James M.

In the current diagnostic pathway, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 serum test is the first method used for detection of pancreatic cancer; although, with poor positive predictive values reported, it cannot provide certain information about the presence of a pancreatic tumor or other surrounding tumors in symptomatic patients. Attenuated total reflection - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) has demonstrated exceptional potential in human blood serum analysis for cancer diagnostics and its implementation in the clinical environment could represent a significant step forward in the early detection of pancreatic cancer. This proof-of-concept study was focused on the discrimination between both cancer versus healthy control samples, and cancer versus symptomatic control samples from patients with comorbidities and\/or confounding diseases. The study aimed to investigate the use of the Dxcover&#174; cancer platform as a novel approach for pancreatic cancer detection. Various machine learning algorithms were applied to discriminate between cancer (n=100) and healthy control samples (n=100), achieving results amounting to a sensitivity of 91.0 &#177; 5.6%, specificity of 87.6 &#177; 5.8%, and accuracy of 89.3 &#177; 3.8% with partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Moreover, an area under the curve (AUC) equal to 0.9536 was obtained through receiving operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The same algorithms were also applied to discriminate between cancer (n=35) and symptomatic control samples (n=35) achieving a balanced sensitivity and specificity over 75% with an AUC of 0.8436. Both discriminations underwent bootstrapping validation and were proven statistically significant. Herein, we present these results and demonstrate that ATR-FTIR spectroscopic analysis of serum is a cost-effective, minimally invasive, highly sensitive and specific test for detection of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4b62cc72-0cc4-437a-9cb2-749d752e12d0\/@y03B8ZT7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Cancer detection,Serum,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17920"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexandra Sala<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James M.

Earlier and expeditious diagnoses in these patients are crucial to reducing the morbidities and mortalities associated with brain tumors. A simple, rapid blood test that can be administered easily in a primary care setting to efficiently identify symptomatic patients who are most likely to have a brain tumor would enable quicker referral to brain imaging for those who need it most. Blood serum samples from 603 patients were prospectively collected and analyzed. Patients either had non-specific symptoms that could be indicative of a brain tumor on presentation to the Emergency Department, or a new brain tumor diagnosis and referral to the neurosurgical unit, NHS Lothian, Scotland. Patient blood serum samples were analyzed using the Dxcover&#174; Brain Cancer liquid biopsy. This technology utilizes infrared spectroscopy combined with a diagnostic algorithm to predict the presence of intracranial disease. Our liquid biopsy approach reported an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8. The sensitivity-tuned model achieves a 96% sensitivity with 45% specificity (NPV 99.3%) and identified 100% of glioblastoma multiforme patients. When tuned for a higher specificity, the model yields sensitivity of 47% with 90% specificity (PPV 28.4%). This simple, non-invasive blood test facilitates the triage and radiographic diagnosis of brain tumor patients, while providing reassurance to healthy patients. Minimizing time to diagnosis would facilitate identification of brain tumor patients at an earlier stage, enabling more effective, less morbid surgical and adjuvant care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b3b3eb97-5d78-43d9-971b-3225c923c492\/@y03B8ZT7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Early detection,Clinical Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17921"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James M.

We have previously reported highly sensitive results of our approach which can discriminate patients with a recent brain tumor diagnosis and asymptomatic controls. Other liquid biopsy approaches (e.g., based on tumor genetic material) report a lower classification accuracy for early-stage tumors. In this manuscript we present an investigation into the link between brain tumor volume and liquid biopsy test performance. In a cohort of 177 patients (90 patients with high-grade glioma (glioblastoma (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma), or low-grade glioma (astrocytoma, oligo-astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma)) tumor volumes were calculated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations and patients were split into two groups depending on MRI parameters (T1 with contrast enhancement or T2\/FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)). Using attenuated total reflection (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with supervised learning methods and machine learning algorithms, 90 tumor patients were stratified against 87 control patients who displayed no symptomatic indications of cancer, and were classified as either glioma or non-glioma. Sensitivities, specificities and balanced accuracies were all greater than 88%, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.98, and cancer patients with tumor volumes as small as 0.2 cm<sup>3<\/sup> were correctly identified. Our spectroscopic liquid biopsy approach can identify gliomas that are both small and low-grade showing great promise for deployment of this technique for early detection and diagnosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0123806d-f6fb-4632-bd3f-b128b0bd921d\/@y03B8ZT7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Cancer detection,Serum,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17922"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexandra Sala<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashton G.

However, evidence is scarce regarding the use of ALBI score to predict occurrence of HCC in patients with chronic liver disease. In the current study, we examined the usefulness of ALBI score to predict occurrence of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis.<br \/><b><i>Methods:<\/i><\/b> In this retrospective study, we included only cirrhotic patients without previous history of HCC. A total of 68 cirrhotic patients (median age, 68 years old; 36 males and 32 females; 42 compensated and 26 decompensated cirrhosis) were included. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, we identified the risk factors for HCC occurrence and mortality. The potential factors were age, gender, causes of cirrhosis (hepatitis virus infection vs others), platelet count, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, serum endocan level, ALBI score, and successful treatment for cirrhosis (yes vs no).<br \/><b><i>Results:<\/i><\/b> The leading cause of cirrhosis was hepatitis virus infection (9 HBV- and 20 HCV-infected patients), followed by alcohol-related liver disease (23 patients), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (5 patients), and other causes (2 patients). The median follow-up period was 10 years. During the study period, 16 patients had HCC and 22 patients died (12 liver failure, 3 HCC, 2 variceal rupture, 2 bacterial infection, and 3 other causes). Cumulative survival rates were 92%, 72%, and 59%, at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Regarding risk factors for HCC occurrence, univariate analysis identified a low platelet count and an increased ALBI score as significant factors. However, on multivariate analysis, an increased ALBI score was the only significant factor [hazard ratio, 7.49 (1.65&#8722;34.04); p = 0.009]. Regarding risk factors for mortality, univariate analysis identified older age as the only significant factor; male gender and hepatitis virus infection tended to be significant.

However not much is known about its effect in the prevention of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in The Gambia.<br \/><b>OBJECTIVE:<\/b> We assess the differences in the features of HCC in both the Hepatitis B vaccinated and non-vaccinated age groups in The Gambia.<br \/><b>METHOD:<\/b> Patients with suspected HCC who were referred to the main liver clinic at the Medical Research Council, Gambia Unit (MRCG) were recruited from June 2011 to September 2019. The diagnostic criteria for HCC comprised of ultrasound demonstration of liver mass &#8805;2 cm with or without clinical features combined with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of &#8805;200 ng\/ml and\/or histopathological confirmation. Clinical, radiological, fibroelastrography and laboratory data were collected in all patients.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> Five hundred and forty two patients were recruited into the study. The majority (91.3%) of the patients were in the non-vaccinated age group and most (88.8%) were born in The Gambia. Those born outside The Gambia were mostly Senegalese, Sierreleonean, and Guineans. The patients in the vaccinated age group were much younger and less likely to be born in The Gambia. They were also more likely to have higher AFP levels, positive HBsAg and a lower creatinine level as compared to those patients in the non-vaccinated age group. There was no difference in clinical manifestations, Liver Function tests and median survival.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> The early introduction of Nationwide Hepatitis B vaccination in 1990 into the EPI program in The Gambia may have had a positive effect in the incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the vaccinated age group. Compared to neighbouring countries, The Gambia seems to be leading the path for Hepatitis B elimination.To strengthen these gains, a nationwide screening and treatment program needs to be implemented for those in the non-vaccinated age groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ad862f2-7513-4ba5-b452-1e55d4939487\/@y03B8ZT7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Infections and virus-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Vaccines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18841"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sheikh Omar Bittaye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramou Njie<\/i><\/presenter>.

The gut microbiome is also implicated in elevated body mass index (BMI), which is a well-established risk factor for the development of BC. This study determined associations between gut microbiome diversity and BC, adjusting for BMI.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>:<b> <\/b>Stool samples were collected from 38 patients with newly-diagnosed BC and 43 age-matched non-cancer controls.

A large volume of preclinical evidence shows that natural stilbenes produce anticancer responses in a variety of cell lines and animal models of different types of cancer, including solid tumors as well as hematological malignancies. However, identification of a particular target with clinical relevance is rare. I will discuss the potent MTA1-targeted anticancer effects of natural stilbenes (resveratrol, pterostilbene, and Gnetin C) observed in unique preclinical models of prostate cancer mimicking high-risk premalignant tumors with overexpressed MTA1. We have shown that MTA1 cooperates with PTEN deficiency to accelerate high-grade PIN development through MTA1-associated signaling. We further demonstrated that stilbene supplemented diets lead to more favorable histopathology with decreased severity and number of PIN foci accompanied with reduced proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis concomitant to reduction of MTA1-associated signaling, including specific miRNAs. Together, our preclinical data provide strong evidence for the potential of stilbenes as promising natural agents for MTA1-targeted interceptive strategy. Human cancer prevention trials for protecting select patients with high MTA1 from developing into full-fledged disease are urgently needed. This can be one extra forward step towards viable and successful interception\/chemoprevention potential for prostate cancer with an implication for precision medicine.

This study used a novel interactive focus group method to identify innovative communication strategies for recruiting women from two minority groups&#8212;Latinas and Asian Americans&#8212;into the Komen Tissue Bank, a specific breast cancer biobank clinical trial. Through activities that employed visual interactive tools to facilitate group discussion and self-reflection, the authors examined perspectives and motivations for Asian American women (N=17) and Latinas (N=14) toward donating their healthy breast tissue. Findings included three themes that, while common to both groups, were unique in how they were expressed: lack of knowledge concerning breast cancer risks and participation in clinical research, cultural influences in breast cancer risk thinking, and how altruism relates to perceived personal connection to breast cancer. More significantly, this study illuminated the importance of using innovative methods to encourage deeper, more enlightened participation among underrepresented populations that may not arise in a traditional focus group format. The findings from this study will inform future health communication efforts to recruit women from these groups into clinical research projects like the Komen Tissue Bank. These findings also illustrate the importance of applying rigorous qualitative work to supplement quantitative research to increase the inclusion of minoritized populations in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a5353b8-4a6f-4367-830f-36c665fd94f7\/@z03B8ZT8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-12 Recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved populations in clinical prevention trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Hispanic,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18845"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katherine E.

We aimed to develop and validate a noninvasive blood-based diagnostic model capable of detecting multiple cancers by assessing the expression levels of serum microRNAs (miRNAs).<br \/>Patients and Methods: Four microarray datasets assessing expression profiles of 2588 serum miRNAs with a standardized platform were assembled from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) totaling 7536 participants including 3604 cancer patients across 13 cancer types and 3932 non-cancer controls. A diagnostic model was built in a training set of 416 participants, including 208 lung cancer patients and 208 non-cancer controls matched for age, sex, and smoking history. The model performance was assessed in the validation sets consisting of all the remaining 7120 participants.<br \/>Results: A 4-miRNA diagnostic model was developed from the lung cancer training set. The model showed 99% sensitivity and specificity in the lung cancer validation set (n=3328, 1358 cancer &#38; 1970 non-cancer participants); and the sensitivity remained to be &#62;99% for patients with stage 1 disease. When applied to the additional dataset of 3792 participants including 2038 cancer patients across 12 cancer types and 1754 independent non-cancer controls, the model showed high sensitivities ranging from 83&#8901;2% to 100% for biliary tract, bladder, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, glioma, liver, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, and reasonable sensitivities of 68&#8901;2% and 72&#8901;0% for ovarian cancer and sarcoma, respectively, while maintaining 99&#8901;3% specificity (Table 1).<br \/>Conclusion: The study provided a proof-of-concept demonstrating that the 4-miRNA model has the potential to be developed into a simple, inexpensive and noninvasive blood test for early detection of multiple cancers with high accuracy.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{3946C0DE-13A7-46C5-85A6-BDEBC682520E}\"><caption>Table 1.

We introduce Crystalogram as a novel, radiation-free, blood-based, breast cancer screening tool, for asymptomatic adult women of all ages, regardless of their risk level. While Crystalogram could be used in tandem with Mammogram, it has unique characteristics that could make it effective as an independent tool, particularly for those who currently have no standard-of-care recommendation for breast screening, i.e., asymptomatic, average risk women younger than 40 or 45 in the U.S. or Europe, respectively. In the realm of cancer screening, positive predictive value (PPV) plays a crucial role. A low or moderate PPV (as in Mammogram) could result in a large number of false positive patients, who would subsequently have to undergo unnecessary tests, some of which are invasive, such as tissue biopsy. By targeting a remarkably high PPV, Crystalogram is aimed to (while offering an attractive sensitivity) reduce the number of false positive patients, and hence offer a true screening platform. Most methods for cancer screening are based on either imaging or (if molecular) cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA). Crystalogram uses circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in conjunction with whole genome sequencing (WGS). Molecular analyses using CTCs pose many technical challenges; however (unlike ctDNA) they provide a complete view of a cell, and hence the related cellular perturbations that are indicative of breast cancer. In ctDNA-based cancer screening methods, the source of nucleic acid for each sequenced fragment is lost. In a CTC-based system, however, the source of all sequenced fragments (i.e., cells they originate from) is known. Additionally, since the nucleic acid for each cell is independently amplified, the number of available fragments per cell is significantly higher as compared to ctDNA originating from comparable cells. Through a CTC-based and molecular technology, Crystalogram can deliver a superior PPV for breast cancer screening, and at a reasonable sensitivity. This is particularly true for breast cancer subtypes that have more dire outcomes and yet evade current screening modalities (e.g., triple negative breast cancer). The crux of Crystalogram&#8217;s high specificity is its two-tiered architecture, where a sample may be called negative at either of the two subsystems (in series), each of which is highly specific: 1) Sample Qualification System (SQS), which operates on a relationship built on the proprietary antibody staining features of the cells along with their physical properties; 2) Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), where the sample can be marked as negative if it does not show the expected proprietary signatures for breast cancer. Since SQS and WGS systems are in series, a modest specificity of 99% for each subsystem would result in a specificity of 99.99% for the complete Crystalogram system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7383cef3-edc3-4ea9-a416-d3c556fe26a2\/@z03B8ZT8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Breast cancer,Screening,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18847"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bahram G.

We apply an inexpensive and scalable data fusion strategy to predict the adverse effect of poor screening mammography rates and to identify the determinants of poor adherence to screening by combining multiple large national databases.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Using 2008-2010 screening mammography rates in 3,110 U.S. counties from the National Cancer Institute State Cancer Profiles, we created tertiles of counties having poor, medium, and superior screening rates. Using the 2000-2016 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registries covering 612 U.S. counties, we abstracted a listing of breast cancer cases of multiple race\/ethnicities, female sex, and diagnosed at age 40 years or above. We linked these data to assign screening rate category to each breast cancer case. We used breast cancer stage categorized as regional\/distant and localized as the outcome to examine the adverse effect of poor screening. Using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) between 2000 and 2015, we obtained data on adherence to screening (i.e., having mammogram within 2 years) and factors corresponding to the Anderson Model for Healthcare Utilization from survey participants of multiple race\/ethnicities, female sex, and age 40 years or above. We applied race\/ethnicity-stratified logistic regression models to estimate the risk of regional\/distant relative to localized stage breast cancer in relation to screening categories, adjusting for age and tumor characteristics, and to identify factors associated with adherence to screening.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among 645,755 breast cancer cases in SEER (72% Non-Hispanic (NH) White, mean [SD] age of 62 [12] years), 36% had regional\/distant stage disease.

However, little is known about how much weight loss and over what time period weight loss precedes cancer diagnosis. Herein, we evaluate the association between weight loss and subsequent 2-year cancer diagnosis using repeatedly measured weight data in two large prospective cohorts.<br \/>Methods: The analysis included 111,891 US women from the Nurses&#8217; Health Study and 45,498 US men from the Health Professional Follow-up Study, who were enrolled in 1978 and 1988, respectively, and followed through 2012, and who were cancer-free and &#8805;40 years old at study entry. Current weight and lifestyle information were assessed every 2 years by questionnaire, and weight change in the previous 2 years was calculated by comparing two consecutive questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for subsequent risk of cancer diagnosis according to weight change percentage. We also examined 20-year trajectories of body mass index (BMI) before cancer diagnosis.<br \/>Results: During 4.1 million person-years of follow-up, we documented 30,441 incident cancers. Participants with recent weight loss were at increased risk for cancer diagnosis in the subsequent 2 years (P<sub>trend <\/sub>&#60;0.0001). Compared with participants without weight loss, those who had a weight loss of 5-10% or &#62;10% had a multivariable-adjusted HR for total cancer of 1.09 (95% CI, 1.04-1.13) and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.10-1.24), respectively. For individual cancer types, increased weight loss was associated with a subsequent cancer diagnosis of esophagus, liver, pancreas, leukemia, stomach, myeloma, lung, colorectal, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (all P<sub>trend<\/sub> &#60;0.005). Comparing participants with weight loss of &#62;10% to those without weight loss, multivariable-adjusted HRs were 4.22 (95% CI, 2.50-7.13) for esophageal cancer, 3.30 (95% CI, 1.65-6.61) for liver cancer, 2.46 (95% CI, 1.84-3.30) for pancreatic cancer, 2.40 (95% CI, 1.59-3.61) for leukemia, 2.26 (95% CI, 1.32-3.87) for stomach cancer, 1.80 (95% CI, 1.14-2.83) for myeloma, 1.45 (95% CI, 1.22-1.73) for lung cancer, 1.38 (95% CI, 1.14-1.66) for colorectal cancer, and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.06-1.72) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The 20-year trajectory of BMI indicated that most weight loss occurred in the 2 years before cancer diagnosis, with the magnitude of weight loss increasing closer to the time of subsequent cancer diagnosis.<br \/>Conclusion: Recent weight loss of &#62;10% predicts elevated risk of cancer diagnosis in the forthcoming 2 years, particularly for cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, hematological system, colorectum, and lung.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2528fd59-00d2-4a56-a5cc-ef1233c997f5\/@z03B8ZT8\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer detection,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18849"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qiao-Li Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Babic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael H.

However, some hypothesize that only lichenoid lesions with dysplasia (LLD) are at risk of progression to cancer. Others have proposed subtypes of LLD, with differing malignant risks. Objectives: To determine if subtypes of LLD exist, based on clinical and histological features, and to determine the proportion of malignant progression in these subtypes. Methods: A nested case control study was conducted using tissue samples and longitudinal data of patients enrolled in the Oral Cancer Prediction Longitudinal study. Inclusion criteria were a biopsy confirmed diagnosis of lichenoid mucositis with dysplasia, no history of head and neck cancer, at least 5 years of follow-up, and accessible clinical photographs and bio-banked tissue. A chart review was conducted, and photographs reviewed to assess for lesion features characteristic of OLP. Histological sections were examined for lichenoid inflammation, and immunohistochemical staining for collagen IV was used to evaluate the integrity of the basement membrane (BM). Two subtypes of LLD were proposed: 1) a primary lichenoid and secondary dysplastic (L1D2) type defined as a lesion with a reticular and bilateral clinical presentation, subepithelial inflammation, and evidence of BM degeneration, and 2) a primary dysplastic and secondary lichenoid type (D1L2), which may present unilaterally or bilaterally, clinically resemble OLP or leukoplakia, and exhibit subepithelial inflammation with or without evidence of BM degeneration. Association with outcome, which was defined as progression to severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or squamous cell carcinoma, was tested using Fisher&#8217;s Exact test. Results: All progressing cases had a non-homogenous clinical presentation (P=0.005) and were more apt to change (in size, texture, and\/or appearance) over time (P=0.002). A reticular, smooth appearance was more common in non-progressing cases (P=0.007, P=0.016, respectively). 30% of cases in the D1L2 subtype progressed to malignancy, compared to none in the L1D2 group, though this finding did not reach statistical significance (P=0.081). Conclusion: LLD with a non-homogenous, non-reticular clinical presentation are at greater risk of progression, and a high proportion of cases exhibiting primary dysplastic features progressed to malignancy, indicating that LLD should be under close clinical follow-up.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b735fa8a-5faf-4209-88cd-1e09ea612ba4\/@z03B8ZT8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,Inflammation,Malignant progression,Premalignancy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18850"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Iris Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oh Run Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leigha Rock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lewei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miriam Rosin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martial Guillaud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Laronde<\/i><\/presenter>.

Current stool-based tests suffer with the handling difficulties with specimen, while blood-based tests that rely on single gene methylation have limited sensitivity. We have developed a multi-locus blood-based assay targeting circulating tumor DNA methylation, ColonAiQ, which was demonstrated the ability of early detection for CRC and advanced adenoma (AA)<sup> [1]<\/sup>.<br \/>Study Design: We further organized a real-world cohort aiming for recruiting 120,000 average-risk population to evaluate ColonAiQ&#8217;s cost-effectiveness and clinical utility over a 3-year period. This <u>Pr<\/u>ospective <u>e<\/u>valuation of <u>C<\/u>olonAiQ, <u>PreC<\/u> study, is organized in Yangzhou city in China being supported by the local government and hospitals.<br \/>Results: From Jan. 2021 to Aug. 2021, 21,735 apparently healthy volunteers aging from 40 to 80 (median 61.8) were recruited with 10ml blood draw to process with ColonAiQ assay. One thousand six hundred and thirty (7.5%) were tested positive in ColonAiQ, among which 650 were further examined by colonoscopy followed by pathological diagnosis on the biopsy specimen. We successfully identified 330 patients with neoplasm, including 14 (4.3%) asymptomatic CRC, 99 (30%) AA, 184 (43.9%) multi-adenoma or non-advanced adenoma, 33 (10%) polyps, together with 19 patients with non-neoplastic GI disorders. The positive predictive value (PPV) is primarily estimated as 2.2% for CRC and 15.2% for AA (43.5% for adenoma), although these numbers can be largely influenced by the scale of the sample size. Among those 14 identified CRC cases, none of them were tested positive in fecal immunochemical test (FIT), the current screening method locally available.<br \/>Conclusion: Results from this real-world analysis of ColonAiQ performance, although a preliminary subset, demonstrates the assay robustness, tester compliance, patient adherence to the test result, substantially maximizing its potential benefits for average-risk CRC screening. ColonAiQ significantly increases the detection rate for precancerous adenomas and early-stage CRC when compared to existing molecular screening tests, which could greatly improve preventative care and CRC patient survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/312d5855-42c3-49c9-b296-3d5031189dfe\/@z03B8ZT8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,Early detection,Cancer detection,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19039"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yanbing Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongsheng Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cuiping Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huisong Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tingdong Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenjun Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huimin Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haipeng Jia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunzhi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Rui Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, it is unclear if this increase persists past the initial round of HPV screening or if rates will subsequently decrease due to earlier detection of precancer using HPV screening, which once treated may not reoccur.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Participants of the HPV FOr CervicAL Cancer (FOCAL) randomized controlled trial (N = 25,223; 2008-2016) received up to two rounds of HPV-based cervix screening during the trial before returning to the cytology-based screening program in British Columbia, Canada (BC). After trial exit, participants were followed through the provincial screening program, which collects results from all screens received in BC, to detect any referral to colposcopy. A comparison cohort from the BC general screening population was created by selecting individuals who were eligible for FOCAL but not invited to participate and pulling their screening data from the provincial registry over the same time period. Post-trial colposcopy rates, calculated per-screen (not per participant), were calculated for the FOCAL population and comparison cohort overall and for those who received one round of HPV testing, those who received two rounds, those who received a negative result on their one round of testing, and those who received two negative results on their two rounds of testing.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The post-trial colposcopy referral rate in the overall FOCAL population was lower than in the comparison cohort. FOCAL had 180 referrals out of 30654 screens (5.9 per 1000 screens, 95%CI: 5.1-6.8), whereas the comparison cohort had 1765\/177880 (9.9\/1000, 95%CI: 9.5-10.4). The rates between those who had one versus two HPV tests were similar: one test: 99\/17599 (5.6\/1000, 95%CI: 4.6-6.8); two tests: 100\/16945 (5.9\/1000, 95%CI: 4.9-7.2). Rates were much lower among those who received negative results: one negative result: 55\/15551 (3.5\/1000, 95%CI: 2.7-4.6); two negative results: 40\/12438 (3.2\/1000, 95%CI: 2.4-4.4).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> After the first round of HPV-based cervix screening, colposcopy rates may decrease potentially below that seen in a cytology-based program. To avoid a surge in colposcopy referrals that could exceed health system capacity, the introduction of HPV-based screening should be done in waves, for example by inviting a new age group each year to HPV-based screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82b8b883-df27-4b53-86d7-6e02118c63b3\/@z03B8ZT8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Prevention,Biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20484"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Gottschlich<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer J.
