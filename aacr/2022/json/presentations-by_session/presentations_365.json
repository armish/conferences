[{"Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b>: Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) rearrangements drive cancers by binding to ERBB3\/ERBB2 heterodimers and activating downstream signaling. NRG1 fusion proteins have recently been identified in several cancer types including lung and ovary. To better understand the role of NRG1 fusions in cancer we established three XenoSTART patient-derived xenograft (XPDX) models driven by NRG1 rearrangements including two CD74-NRG1 lung models designated ST2891 and ST3204 and one SARAF-NRG1 ovary model designated ST2476. These models were established in athymic nude mice and characterized for receptor expression, genomic alterations, and in vivo drug sensitivity.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: ST2891 was established from an excision biopsy collected from a 68-year-old male with NSCLC following treatment with carboplatin\/paclitaxel and carboplatin\/pemetrexed. ST3204 was established from a lymph node biopsy collected from a 63-year-old female with NSCLC following treatment with cisplatin\/pemetrexed. ST2476 was established from primary tissue collected from a chemo na&#239;ve 61-year-old female with ovarian cancer. The resulting models were passaged and characterized using immunohistochemical and genomic analysis including WES and RNA<sub>seq<\/sub>. In vivo studies were performed testing various chemotherapy and targeted agents; study endpoints included tumor volume and time from treatment initiation with %T\/C values and tumor regression reported at study completion; a %T\/C of &#8804; 20 versus control was considered sensitive. Tumor regression (%T\/C&#60;0) versus Day 0 tumor volume was also reported.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: All models reported ERBB2 and ERBB3 staining in evaluated passages with similar histology compared with archival clinical samples. WES analysis of the three models did not identify any variants in EGFR\/ERBB2-4\/RAS\/RAF genes . RNA sequencing revealed CD74-NRG1 or SARAF-NRG1 gene fusions independently confirmed using molecular studies. In vivo, both lung models were resistant to weekly cisplatin or T-DM1 and daily palbociclib (50 mg\/kg) or daily afatinib up to 10 mg\/kg. ST3204 was found sensitive to weekly pertuzumab (1 mg\/kg) . Both lung models were resistant to trastuzumab (1 mg\/kg). The ST2476 ovary XPDX was found resistant to endocrine therapies and reported some sensitivity to weekly cisplatin.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: We have established and characterized a panel of three XPDX models driven by NRG1 rearrangements including two CD74-NRG1 lung models and one SARAF-NRG1 ovary model. These models are valuable tools for further developing therapies targeting NRG1-driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dc2892b1-e040-416e-bb77-0ddaf7d6c8ff\/@B03B8ZEU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-06 New nonclinical models for targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuregulin,Fusion genes,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,ErbB receptors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12996"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alyssa Simonson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johnnie Flores<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Crystal Moreno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justine Hruzek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyriakos Papadopoulos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Drew Rasco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amita Patnaik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald Drengler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allan White<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael J.

Using publicly available human melanoma datasets and bioinformatics analyses, we previously identified 21 immune-related genes that are differentially expressed in metastatic melanoma and have significant association with patient survival (Cancer Res 2021;81(13 Suppl):Abstract 873). Further, we shortlisted five candidate genes that have been implicated in pathogenesis of certain cancers; however, their role in melanoma is not known. These include, (i) Marginal Zone B and B1 cell specific protein (MZB1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized protein that is shown to constitutively express in B cells as well as on cancer cells; (ii) SAM Domain, SH3 Domain and Nuclear Localization Signals 1 (SAMSN1), a negative regulator of B-cell activation that regulates cell spreading and cell polarization; (iii) NCK Associated Protein 1 Like (NCKAP1L) that controls lymphocyte development, activation, and proliferation, as well as phagocytosis and migration by neutrophils and macrophages; (iv) Kallikrein Related Peptidase 8 (KLK8), an epidermal protease involved in the skin barrier proteolytic cascade; and (v) Epstein Barr Virus Induced Gene 3 (EBI3) functions in innate immune responses. This study was aimed to validate the expression profile of these five proteins (MZB1, SAMSN1, NCKAP1L, KLK8 and EBI3) in clinical melanoma tissues along with S100, a melanoma biomarker. We performed fluorescent immunostaining of a human melanoma tissue microarray (ME2082c; US Biomax) consisting of 208 melanoma tissue cores (128 cases of primary malignant melanoma, 64 metastatic melanoma, 8 adjacent skin and 8 normal skin tissue) followed by multispectral Vectra Imaging coupled with inForm software analysis. Our results showed significantly increased expression of KLK8, SAMSN1 and EBI3 in S100-positive melanoma cells compared to S100-negative cells. Further, MZB1 and NCKAP1L protein levels were significantly increased in melanoma primary tumors and metastatic tissues compared to normal skin. Furthermore, an increasing trend for KLK8 and SAMSN1 proteins, though not significant, was observed in melanoma tissues. Interestingly, EBI3 expression was not found to be altered between the melanoma and skin tissues. Next, using in vitro cell culture analysis, we quantified MZB1 protein levels using Simple Western in various human melanoma cell lines and normal human melanocytes. We observed increased MZB1 protein levels in four human melanoma cell lines (A375, G361, HS294T, WM115) compared to normal melanocytes. Overall, our study suggests that MZB1 and NCKAP1L could be potential new targets for melanoma management. Additional validation and further evaluation of functional significance of these immune-related proteins using in vitro and in vivo models may lead to new prognostic and therapeutic strategies for melanoma management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fc68be29-5995-4fd8-8108-a5c990b16890\/@B03B8ZEU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12997"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gagan Chhabra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Thornton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shengqin Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary A.

Src Family Kinases (SFKs) play a relevant role in CRC, where Src activation is associated with an aggressive phenotype and a worse prognosis; and could be involved in chemoresistance mechanisms. Dasatinib is a potent Src inhibitor with demonstrated anti-proliferative activity, although deeper knowledge is needed. Thus, we aimed to explore the role of Src in BRAF V600E CRC and to investigate this tumor subgroup in response to Dasatinib. SRC activation was evaluated by Western Blot. We generated Knock-Out (KO) Src cell lines by CRISPR\/Cas9 system and stable Src overexpression (OE) by lentivirus. Cell viability was analysed by crystal violet and MTS assay. Phospho-kinase proteins screening was performed using the Proteome Profiler Human Phospho-Kinase Array kit. Expression levels of Src and phospho-Src (p-Src) displayed an inverse correlation with IC50 values for Dasatinib in a panel of 7 CRC cell lines including BRAF V600E (HT29, COLO201, RKO, LS411N) and BRAF WT (DIFI, HCA7 and LIM1215), and these doses were able to inhibit Src activation in all cell lines. Focusing on HT29 cells, inhibition of p-Src occurs in a dose-dependent manner and in shortened periods of treatment. Dasatinib showed a significant inhibition of proliferation and migration on HT29.<b> <\/b>Moreover, stable Src-OE HT29 cells showed higher clonogenicity, migration and proliferation capacities, as well as higher resistance to Dasatinib. Conversely, HT29 Src KO cells were more sensitive. In line with those results, silencing Src in other BRAF V600E cells (RKO and LS411N) also resulted in a remarkable reduction in clonogenicity and migration abilities. Xenograft mouse model of SRC depletion showed that the growth of SRC KO tumors was significantly slower than WT tumors. Phospho-kinase array quantification in basal and Src-OE HT29 cells showed up- and downregulated proteins related to classical tumorigenic signaling pathways such as MAPK (JNK1\/2, MSK), PI3K\/Akt (Akt, TOR, GSK3), and others. Further studies to explore resistance mechanisms mediated by Src\/SFKs are required. To conclude, lower p-Src expression at baseline is related to a higher resistance to Dasatinib in all CRC cell lines. Dasatinib showed a significant anti-proliferative activity in a subset of CRC cell lines and regulates the activity of Src in a time and dose-dependent manner. Modified expression of Src (OE and KO) in BRAF V600E CRC cells significantly regulates clonogenicity, proliferation and migration abilities <i>in vitro<\/i>. Src overexpression is responsible of the acquired resistance to Dasatinib and regulates several pathways that could be involved in the tumorigenesis of BRAF V600E CRC, although further studies to explore resistance mechanisms mediated by Src\/SFKs are required.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30d0f276-b326-4514-b88a-b120724caa33\/@B03B8ZEU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,SRC Family Kinases,BRAF V600E,Alternative therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12998"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Beatriz Rubio Cuesta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Gil Calderón<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia LLamas Granda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacinto Sarmentero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Carretero Puche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>María del Carmen Riesco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rocío García Carbonero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Soldevilla<\/i><\/presenter>.

The multimodal management approach does not extend survival beyond 2 years. Due to diverse variability in subpopulations of patients with glioma, treatment benefits are not uniform with apoptosis evasion being a key attribute of treatment resistance in GBM. Antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, are frequently upregulated in acquired chemo resistant cancer cells. Here in, we investigated the anti-proliferative effects of disrupting &#8220;Bcl-2-regulated pathways&#8221; in GBM. Of note, accessibility of FDA approved Bcl-2 inhibitors with known safety profile, makes it a biologically relevant target where intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity can be overcome successfully. Western Blot (WB) analysis was performed to compare the Bcl-2 family expression in human GBM cell lines (LN229, T98G, DI321, SA21). RT-PCR data was obtained for Bcl-2 family mRNA expression profile in present GBM cell lines. IC50s were determined for afore mentioned cell lines using MTS assay for Temozolomide (TMZ, alkylating agent), Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT199, Bcl-xL inhibitor A1331852, Mcl-1 inhibitor AZD5991, and BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib. Further, synergistic activity of TMZ, ABT199, A1331852, AZD5991 and Ibrutinib in several permutations. All experiments were performed with an n of 3\/5. Our data suggests upregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in GBM cells including GSCs (DI321) and patient derived cells (SA21). There was significant decrease in viability of these cells when treated with ABT199 and A-1331852 (p&#60; 0.0001) as compared to TMZ as a single agent. Other combinations ABT199+AZD5991 (p&#60; 0.0001), AZD5991+A-1331852 (p&#60; 0.0001) and TMZ+ABT (p&#60;0.0002) also shows anti-tumor activity. Alternatively, we observed increased sensitivity in TMZ-resistant GBM cells against these drugs using MTS assay.<b> <\/b>GBM is an aggressive malignancy with 100% recurrence over time.

Identification of appropriate drugs is hampered, however, by the assumption that a three-dimensional setting may be required to observe significant inhibitory effects, possibly due to alternate gene expression and protein activity in such a &#8220;closer-to-physiology&#8221; setting. In order to explore that topic, in the current study we have made use of our 140 cell lines (CL)-2D proliferation panel (3 days incubation) and our 100CL-3D soft agar panel (&#62; 7 days incubation). On these platforms, we have compared inhibitors targeting the KRas\/Raf\/MEK pathway via either KRas:SOS interaction (e.g. BI3406), the KRas mutation at G12C (e.g. AMG510), or Raf-kinase (e.g. AZ628) and MEK1\/2-kinase activity (e.g. AZD6244). It showed that especially the Raf- and MEK kinase inhibitors exhibited significantly enhanced potency in the 3D soft agar setting in the majority of the cell lines tested. The other inhibitors also showed an increased potency under soft agar conditions, however, on clearly fewer cell lines and usually not as strongly. For all kinds of inhibitors tested, the most significant changes in potency were associated with enhanced efficacy as observed by stronger cell death induction. Differences may be attributable to three-dimensional growth, but also to the elongated duration of the soft agar assay. For selected conditions, we addressed this topic by analyzing the inhibitor impact on 3D spheroid growth after shorter incubation times. Our results show that 3D growth analysis either in the soft agar or spheroid setting clearly supports the development of KRas\/Raf\/MEK pathway inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/32e1cd53-7ba1-4e28-a8bb-e050cb6f0bf2\/@C03B8ZEV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D cell culture,KRAS,Profiling,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13002"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Katharina Schaich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Feger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Siedentopf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Ulrich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jan Erik Ehlert<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

CRC patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and resistance to chemotherapy is a major clinical problem. It is well-established that 5-FU induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but apoptosis inhibition does not block the anticancer effect of 5-FU, suggesting a role of non-apoptotic cell death. Necroptosis is a regulated form of necrosis controlled by Receptor-Interacting Protein kinase 1 (RIP1), RIP3, and Mixed Lineage Kinase domain-Like (MLKL). TCGA RNA-Seq data reveal that RIP1 and RIP3 are frequently downregulated in CRC, with RIP3 downregulation correlating with worse clinical outcomes. We found that loss of RIP3 expression in CRC cells is associated with decreased 5-FU sensitivity. RIP3 silencing in CRC was shown to be caused by promoter hypermethylation. However, the exact functional role of RIP3 in response to anticancer therapies remains unclear. Our studies reveal that RIP3-expressing CRC cells were able to undergo both apoptosis and necroptosis in response to 5-FU treatment, which was abrogated upon knock-out or inhibition of RIP3. Restoration of RIP3 in RIP3-silenced CRC cells by transfection enhanced 5-FU sensitivity, along with restored necroptosis and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, we have shown that RIP3 expression can be restored in RIP3-silenced CRC cells by the DNA methyltransferase 1 inhibitor 5-aza-2&#8217;-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), which also enhances 5-FU sensitivity. This effect of 5-aza-dC is partially dependent on RIP3 and suppressed by a RIP3 inhibitor. Together, our results suggest RIP3 plays a critical role in response to 5-FU and other chemotherapeutic agents, and that restoring RIP3 expression can be used to potentiate chemotherapy. These results provide novel insight into the functional role of RIP3 in CRC chemotherapy, which could be explored for developing improved and personalized CRC treatments based on RIP3 status.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/430574b2-50e9-4f6d-9402-e1cba53bd207\/@C03B8ZEV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell death,Chemotherapy response,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13003"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"60e4c1f8-d483-428b-a62f-781c45fe8d05","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/60e4c1f8-d483-428b-a62f-781c45fe8d05\/@C03B8ZEV\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kaylee Ermine<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongshi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

This indicates that lymphomas may be especially sensitive to therapeutics that trigger genomic instability. Here, we report the powerful therapeutic combination of Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) and BCL2 inhibitors for aggressive lymphomas. Mechanistically, the PLK4 inhibitor CFI-400945 impairs centrosome duplication leading to genomic instability and tetraploidy (4n) in lymphoma cells. Elimination of polyploid lymphoma cells is mediated by the pro-apoptotic BAX protein resulting in increased BCL2 dependence for cell survival. The selective BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax, acts in a synthetic lethal manner with PLK4 inhibition in both CFI-400945 sensitive and in CFI-400945 resistant lymphomas. As PLK4 is dispensable in non-proliferating cells, synthetic lethality is preferentially observed in tumor cells, while sparing vital organs. Hence, B cell lymphomas are ill-prepared for the rapid, pharmacologic induction of polyploidy resulting in a synthetic and tumor-specific dependency on BCL2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e3ec4957-2c57-4a72-83eb-554c3cb77fb8\/@C03B8ZEV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Kinase inhibitors,Combination therapy,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13004"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ana Portelinha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariana Da Silva Ferreira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatiana Erazo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zahra Asgari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa De Stanchina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anas Younes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hans-Guido Wendel<\/i><\/presenter>.

Lung cancer has been one of the deadliest cancers in the United States. TP53-dependent reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis (PRIMA-1) changes mutant TP53&#8217;s conformation, resulting in the restoration of DNA binding and activation of p53 target genes. PRIMA-1 methylated analog, PRIMA-1<sup>Met<\/sup> (APR-246, Eprenetapopt) have been used in clinical trials to target cancers containing mutant TP53. It has been reported that PRIMA-1 induced apoptosis through the regulation of microRNAs. Our research group has previously developed a transgenic mice model with a mutant form of TP53 being expressed lung specifically, to closely model human lung cancer development. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of PRIMA-1 on miRNA expressions in a murine spontaneous lung cancer mice model, human lung cancer cell lines H211 and H1155. The transgenic FVB\/N mice lung tumor model was developed using the lung specific human surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter to control the expression of mutant TP53(273H) following the standard injection method<b>. <\/b>Tumor bearing mice were identified with a micro-CT and were treated with the PRIMA-1 at a dose of 100mg\/kg. Additionally, we treated two human cell lines H211 (containing mutant TP53 R248Q) and H1155 (containing mutant TP53 R273H) with the PRIMA-1. The miRNA expression profile was evaluated with the NanoString nCounter array analysis and qt-PCR array analysis. We found that three miRNAs were up-regulated (&#62;1.5-fold change) in the human lung cancer cells H211, H1155, and murine spontaneous non-small cell lung cancers model post treatment of PRIMA-1. The result of the study showed that miR-200c, miR-181c, and miR-183 was up-regulated in the two human cell lines and the transgenic mice lung tumors after treatment of PRIMA-1. While there was no significant downregulation in miRNA expression in these human lung cancer cells and the murine spontaneous lung cancer model. However, the overall miRNA expression is lower in murine spontaneous lung tumors when compared to the overall miRNA expression of the cell lines post PRIMA-1 treatment. This difference is due to model specific expression. Further investigation is needed to better understand the effects of PRIMA-1 in regulation of micro-RNA expression in the treatment of lung cancers containing mutant p53.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/43476514-f855-4820-be5d-3f521ea59072\/@C03B8ZEV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,p53 mutations,MicroRNA,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13006"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melanie Perez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaylyn Grier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenrui Duan<\/i><\/presenter>.

In particular, our group has highlighted the role of superoxide (O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.-<\/sup>)-mediated signaling in the acquisition of drug resistance and cancer survival. Mechanistically, this involves post-translational modification of proteins involved in oncogenic signaling, such as c-Myc and NF-&#954;B, as well as apoptosis resistance like Bcl-2 at the serine 70 phosphorylation site. Here we present evidence that O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.-<\/sup>-mediated signaling stabilizes anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, a commonly amplified gene in human cancers and is implicated in resistance to venetoclax, the Bcl-2 specific BH3 mimetic.<br \/><b><i>Methods:<\/i><\/b><i> <\/i>Intracellular O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.- <\/sup>levels was increased either pharmacologically or by siRNA mediated knockdown of <i>SOD1<\/i> in MOLM14, RPMI8226, OCI-AML3 hematopoietic cell lines. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by MTT and Annexin V\/DAPI staining. Protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis. BH3 profiling of patient-derived CLL cells was used to assess mitochondrial priming.<br \/><b><i>Results:<\/i><\/b> Elevated O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.- <\/sup>levels increased Mcl-1 stability through Thr163 phosphorylation of Mcl-1, which in turn reduced ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Furthemore, venetoclax resistant cells possessed higher O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.- <\/sup>levels and increase in intracellular O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.- <\/sup>levels<sup> <\/sup>promoted resistance to Mcl-1 inhibitor, S63845 through increased binding between Mcl-1 and pro-apoptotic proteins NOXA and Bak. Contrarily, scavenging of O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.- <\/sup>re-sensitized venetoclax-resistant leukemia cells to venetoclax. Importantly, BH3 profiling revealed that increase in intracellular O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.- <\/sup>levels decreased overall mitochondrial priming in primary CLL cells by promoting sequestration of pro-apoptotic proteins that specifically target Mcl-1.<br \/><b><i>Conclusion:<\/i><\/b> Oncogenic activity of O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.- <\/sup>is mediated by increased Mcl-1 stability through Thr163 phosphorylation, which resulted in a reduction in overall mitochondrial priming and increased binding of Mcl-1 to NOXA and Bak. Scavenging O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>.- <\/sup>reduces Mcl-1 levels and sensitizes resistant cells to venetoclax-induced apoptosis thereby demonstrating that manipulation of the redox microenvironment could be a potential vulnerability to be exploited in venetoclax resistant cancers","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/baff6a55-4416-42e5-b93f-921965b3026c\/@C03B8ZEV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-03 Bcl-2 family proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mcl-1,Redox,Mitochondria,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21399"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jolin Xiao Hui Lai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Jun Fei Chong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Davids<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Shazib Pervaiz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
