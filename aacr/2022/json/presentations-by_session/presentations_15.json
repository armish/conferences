Despite the clinical benefit achieved with these drugs, many patients achieve incomplete disease control and resistance often emerges. With the goal of addressing this clinical need, we applied our proprietary CRISPRomics technology to identify novel targets in cancer indications characterized by defects in DNA repair pathways. One of the top ranked targets was the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1. USP1 has established roles in DNA damage repair processes including Translesion Synthesis and the Fanconi Anemia pathway. We developed KSQ-4279, a potent, highly selective inhibitor of USP1. KSQ-4279 was active in cells, leading to the accumulation of mono-ubiquitinated substrates of USP1 and inhibited the proliferation of cancer cell lines with BRCA mutations or other HRD alterations. Studies investigating the effect of combining KSQ-4279 with PARP inhibitors revealed clear evidence of synergy in cell lines with partial or no sensitivity to each agent alone. To investigate how the distinct mechanisms of action of KSQ-4279 and PARP inhibitors would be reflected in their resistance profiles, we used our CRISPRomics technology to perform functional genomic resistance screens. The top scoring resistance genes for KSQ-4279 were distinct from those identified for PARP inhibitors, which raised the possibility that combining PARP and USP1 inhibitors may provide more durable disease control by reducing the emergence of resistance. Evaluation of KSQ-4279 in patient-derived ovarian and triple-negative breast cancer xenograft models demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition as a single agent and in combination with PARP inhibitors. In xenograft models that were insensitive or only partially sensitive to PARP inhibitors, the combination of KSQ-4279 and Olaparib led to tumor regressions and durable tumor control. This data supports the ongoing clinical trial of KSQ-4279 in patients with tumors harboring BRCA1\/2 or other HRD mutations, both as a single agent and in combination with PARP inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,DNA repair,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Louise Cadzow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erica Tobin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pamela Sullivan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sol Shenker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sumeet Nayak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janid Ali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hugh Gannon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Dodson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paula Grasberger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alyssa Carlson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael McGuire<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jehrod Brenneman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanlan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Olaharski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerstin Sinkevicius<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeff Hixon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elsa Krall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mike Schlabach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matt Goulet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Wilt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Harris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Stegmeier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Andrew Wylie<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Significant progress has been made in the past several years to directly target KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> with the FDA approval of sotorasib and the reported clinical activity of adagrasib (MRTX849). Despite these remarkable breakthroughs, additional therapies that enhance the depth and duration of response to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors provide the opportunity to build upon the initial progress. SOS proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that transduce receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling from the cell surface and facilitate the activation of RAS family proteins. In addition, SOS1 is a target of negative feedback signaling following RAS-mediated activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade. Thus, SOS proteins represent a significant therapeutic node that maintains RAS pathway equilibrium as well as oncogenic signaling dynamics. Here we highlight the discovery and preclinical evaluation of MRTX0902, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of SOS1 presently in IND-enabling studies. A structure-based approach was used to identify a novel chemical series that disrupts the protein-protein interaction between SOS1 and KRAS, thereby preventing SOS1-mediated GTP-exchange on GDP-bound KRAS. Considering MRTX849 preferentially binds to inactive GDP-bound KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, targeting SOS1 in this genetic context increases the ability of MRTX849 to bind and inhibit KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>. The combination of MRTX0902 with MRTX849 enhances the depth and durability of an anti-tumor response when compared to MRTX849 alone in pre-clinical KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumor models. MRTX0902 augments additional targeted therapies across a variety of RAS-addicted tumors, indicating that SOS1 inhibition is effective against a broad spectrum of mutations within the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, drug-anchored CRISPR experiments with MRTX0902 and MRTX849 uncovered a previously underappreciated functional role of the SOS1 paralog, SOS2, in KRAS-addicted tumors. In addition to aiding in the understanding of SOS and RAS family signaling dynamics, these studies implicate SOS2 as a potential cancer drug target in the context of SOS1\/KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition. In summary, we have used a structure-based approach to discover a SOS1 inhibitor that augments the anti-tumor activity of MRTX849 and additional targeted MAPK pathway inhibitors. We anticipate our findings to translate into the clinic and make an impact in patients with RAS-addicted tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,SOS1,KRAS,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>John M.

In addition to their induction of direct cytotoxicity, their potency is amplified by cytokine driven actions downstream of T cell activation that enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Because of this two-fold mechanism of action, TCEs have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors that are not responsive to other immune therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. While a razor-thin therapeutic index (TI) has been observed in hematologic malignancies for TCEs like blinatumomab, and similarly with CAR-Ts, developing solid tumor T-cell-directed therapies has been hampered by <i>on<\/i>-target <i>off-<\/i>tumor toxicities including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), other toxicities, and other challenges related to immunogenicity. Attempts to circumvent CRS include step-up dosing, prophylactic steroids, complex molecular designs, have had limited success. Unmasked TCEs targeting HER2 have been unable to achieve a therapeutic index in the clinic due to dose limiting CRS toxicities at doses below 1 ug\/kg.<br \/>To address this challenge, we have engineered conditionally-activated T cell engagers or XPATs (XTENylated Protease Activated T Cell Engagers), that exploit the intrinsically high protease activity in tumors relative to healthy tissues. XPATs utilize our universal protease-releasable masking technology (Pro-XTEN) to provide preferential unmasking and activation in tumors, thereby mitigating <i>off<\/i>-tumor toxicities. Several key features of the technology have clinical validation including half-life extension, protease-driven unmasking and low immunogenicity, as over 200 patients have been treated with XTENylated products.<br \/>AMX-818 is a conditionally active, masked T cell engager targeting HER2. AMX-818 is comprised of a tandem scFv core with a HER2-binding domain and a proprietary low affinity CD3 binding domain with each domain masked by a protease-releasable XTEN polymer that works by spatial\/steric shielding of the active domains. AMX-818 is designed to overcome the <i>on<\/i>-target, <i>off<\/i>-tumor toxicities associated with existing TCEs by mitigating toxicity against healthy tissues that express the target antigen. Extensive <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> preclinical testing demonstrate the potential for AMX-818 to drive anti-tumor activity similar to an unmasked TCE, yet significantly expand the safety margin in NHPs.<br \/><i>In vitro<\/i>, proteolytically-unmasked AMX-818 demonstrates potent cytotoxicity against tumor lines with EC50s in the single-digit pM range. AMX-818 reduces target-directed T cell cytotoxicity and T cell activation by up to 4 orders of magnitude, while singly-masked variants of AMX-818 show intermediate activity relative to unmasked HER2 T cell engager. Only minimal complete unmasking of AMX-818 is required to generate potent cytotoxicity. In the established HER2-high (BT-474) and HER2-low (HT-55) xenograft models, AMX-818 induced protease-dependent tumor regressions comparable to the unmasked (active) TCE while remaining stable in circulation. <i>In vivo<\/i>, preferential cleavage of XPATs were demonstrated in patient-derived xenograft tumors relative to healthy organs (average of 24% unmasked TCE was observed in tumors).<br \/>In NHPs, AMX-818 demonstrated a wide safety margin (MTD of AMX-818 = 42mg\/kg vs MTD of fully unmasked HER2 TCE = 0.2mg\/kg\/day), supported by its protease stability in circulation and a maximum tolerated Cmax that was &#62;400-fold higher than that of its active form (unmasked HER2 TCE). No CRS or systemic T cell activation was observed even at 50 mg\/kg, supportive of minimal CRS risk for XPATs,<br \/>whereas the unmasked form induced lethal CRS at <u>&#62;<\/u> 0.3 mg\/kg\/day. Only 1-3% of the singly-cleaved XPAT metabolites were detected in plasma from NHPs treated with high doses of AMX-818 (25 &#38; 42 mg\/kg), while the fully unmasked TCE form was undetectable. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies in which AMX-818 was incubated for 7-days at 37<sup>o<\/sup>C in plasma from healthy and diseased NHPs and humans, (conditions which over-represent the accumulation of metabolites in vivo) demonstrate that AMX-818 is stable in plasma with comparable amounts of fully unmasked TCE generated between species. The similar rates of cleavage between species and the strong safety margin observed with AMX-818 in NHPs predict limited systemic accumulation of active TCE in human patients. In a repeat-dose GLP toxicology study, the highest dose evaluated (6 mg\/kg) was the NOAEL, suggesting that HER2-XPAT has a wide TI based on predicted human PK and predicted efficacious exposures.<br \/>The collective data demonstrate a significant decrease in toxicity with AMX-818 compared to its potent, fully unmasked TCE counterpart. Together with the data supporting stability of AMX-818 in plasma and healthy tissue and its preferential cleavage in tumors, the nonclinical data package supports further evaluation in a planned clinical trial. AMX-818 represents a promising solution to widen the TI for TCE activity in HER2-high and HER2-low expressing tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Cancer immunotherapy,Prodrugs,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bryan Irving<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Instead, PDE3A binding stimulates the RNase activity of SLFN12, resulting in cleavage of the specific SLFN12 substrate, tRNA-Leu-TAA. Cleavage of tRNA-Leu-TAA in turn causes ribosomal pausing, inhibition of protein synthesis, and cancer cell death. Unlike traditional targeted therapies that leverage dependencies created in cancer cells by genomic alterations, velcrins instead kill cancer cells by a gain-of-function mechanism dependent on the RNase activity of SLFN12.<br \/>In a collaboration between the Broad Institute and Bayer Pharmaceuticals, we developed the first velcrin, BAY 2666605, to enter Phase I clinical trials. BAY 2666605 is active in cell line and patient-derived xenografts of several tumor types, specifically where elevated levels of the two biomarkers, PDE3A and SLFN12, are expressed. Biomarker-positive tumors are especially enriched among melanomas, and we have consistently observed tumor regression in biomarker-positive melanoma tumor models <i>in vivo<\/i>. BAY 2666605 furthermore shows drug-like properties, excellent brain penetration, increased stimulation of SLFN12 RNase activity, and reduced inhibition of PDE3A enzymatic activity compared with most other velcrins and approved PDE3A inhibitors. BAY 2666605 has recently entered a First-in-Human study (NCT04809805) in patients with advanced solid tumors that co-express PDE3A and SLFN12, including melanoma, ovarian cancer, and sarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Cell death,SLFN12 RNase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Stefan Gradl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sooncheol Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Lange<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyun Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Goldoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Lewis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlotte Kopitz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colin Garvie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Lienau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Hoyt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henrik Seidel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephan Kaulfuss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuel Ellermann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luc De Waal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrian Tersteegen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sven Golfier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Detlev Suelzle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christa Hegele-Hartung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Carr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederick Brookfield<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Bruening<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie Berthold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thibaud Jourdan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Schenone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Galen Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph McGaunn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antje Wengner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Aquilanti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Franziska Siegel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marine Garrido<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annette Walter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle Genvresse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Cherniack<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stuart Schreiber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Knut Eis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Eheim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Meyerson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Heidi Greulich<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
