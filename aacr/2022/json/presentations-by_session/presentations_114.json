Why is cancer highly associated with old age, and why are insults like smoking, obesity, and sunlight associated with increased risk of cancers? Of course, these contexts all cause mutations, and some of these mutations can contribute to malignant phenotypes. But we now understand that carcinogenesis is much more complex than originally appreciated. In particular, there are microenvironmental forces that both impede and promote cancer evolution. Just as organismal evolution is known to be driven by environmental changes, somatic evolution in our bodies is similarly driven by changes in tissue environments, whether caused by the normal process of aging, by lifestyle choices or by extrinsic exposures. Environmental change promotes selection for new phenotypes that are adaptive to the new context. In our tissues, aging or insult-driven alterations in tissues drives selection for adaptive mutations, and some of these mutations can confer malignant phenotypes. We will discuss the evidence from many labs for microenvironmental change driven selection in the evolution of cancer, additional support from epidemiological and clinical studies, as well as the limitations, inconsistencies and unknowns that require the attention of cancer researchers. My own lab has been using mouse models of cancer initiation, mathematical models of clonal evolution, and analyses of human tissue samples to better understand the evolutionary forces that control somatic cell evolution and thus cancer risk. Using Monte Carlo modeling, we have explored the impact of key somatic evolutionary parameters on multi-stage carcinogenesis, revealing that two additional major mechanisms, aging-dependent somatic selection and life history-dependent evolution of species-specific tumor suppressor mechanisms, need to be incorporated into the multi-stage model of carcinogenesis to make it capable of generalizing cancer incidence across tissues and species. Using mouse models, we have shown that aging and inflammation dependent changes in tissue microenvironments dramatically impact the fitness impact of oncogenic mutations, leading to aging and inflammation driven clonal expansions in the hematopoietic compartment. These studies have also uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying oncogene-driven adaptation to aged and inflammatory tissue environments. In all, these studies indicate that strategies to prevent or treat cancers will need to incorporate interventions that alter tissue microenvironments. While we largely cannot prevent mutation accumulation through our lives, we do have the ability to manipulate tissue microenvironments so as to change the evolutionary trajectories of oncogenically-mutated cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Somatic mutations,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James V.

Still, there are many roadblocks that must be overcome to make immunotherapies effective across a broader spectrum of patients and cancer types. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies that are effective in some malignancies through reactivation of cytotoxic T cell immunity have failed in immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) due to poor T cell infiltration and weak antigen presentation necessary for effective anti-tumor T cell responses. We and others have demonstrated that induction of cellular senescence and the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which leads to production of immunomodulatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, can be a powerful way to not only enhance T cell infiltration into tumors but also reactivate a different type of innate, antigen-independent Natural Killer (NK) cell immunity that can mediate tumor control. Recently, we found that a combination of two RAS pathway targeting therapies- the MEK inhibitor trametinib and CDK4\/6 inhibitor palbociclib (T\/P)- could induce senescence in genetically engineered mouse models of KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma and PDAC (Ruscetti*, Leibold*, Bott* et al. Science 2018; Ruscetti*, Morris*, Mezzadra* et al. Cell 2020). Strikingly, whereas therapy-induced senescence led to NK cell-mediated tumor regressions and long-term survival benefit in KRAS mutant lung cancer, it had little effect on NK cell immunity and tumor progression in PDAC. Here we set out to understand how the pancreas tumor microenvironment (TME) suppresses NK immunity and develop strategies to harness NK cell surveillance for immunotherapy in PDAC.<br \/><b>Results and Discussion<\/b>: We took advantage of genetically similar <i>Kras<\/i> mutant, <i>p53<\/i> altered PDAC and lung cancer cell lines that could be transplanted into different organs of C57BL\/6 mice to study whether and how the pancreas TME may impact senescence-driven immune responses. Syngeneic KRAS mutant lung and PDAC tumor cells transplanted into the pancreas of C57BL\/6 mice displayed transcriptional repression and reduced chromatin accessibility of SASP transcriptional activators (NF-KB, IRFs) and factors necessary for NK cell activity (IL-15, IL-18) and chemotaxis (CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10) following T\/P-induced senescence, and did not undergo anti-tumor NK immune surveillance as compared to tumors propagated in the lungs and liver. Transcriptomic analysis identified induction of EZH2 and epigenetic repression of its targets, including key SASP factors and regulators, specifically in tumor cells grown in the pancreas TME. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 enhanced proinflammatory SASP signaling and resulted in NK cell migration and anti-tumor cytotoxicity in murine and human PDAC lines and transplanted and genetically engineered PDAC mouse models. Remarkably, tumor-intrinsic EZH2 knockdown in combination with T\/P treatment led to complete tumor regressions in some PDAC-bearing mice that were reversed following NK cell depletion or suppression of key SASP factors. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 methyltransferase activity also enhanced NK cell infiltration and tumor control following therapy-induced senescence in transplanted and genetically engineered PDAC mouse models. Importantly, we found that an EZH2 repression signature was associated with enhanced NK cell infiltration and SASP induction in human PDAC patient samples. These results demonstrate that EZH2 mediates transcriptional repression of the proinflammatory SASP in the pancreas TME, and that EZH2 blockade in combination with senescence-inducing therapies could be a powerful means to reactivate absent NK cell surveillance in PDAC to achieve immune-mediated tumor responses. In the future we plan to test these therapeutic interventions in combination with anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 ICB therapy as a means to further activate both NK and T cell immunity to fully eradicate pancreatic cancer. This work highlights the importance of understanding the impact of the resident tumor microenvironment on anti-tumor immune responses to come up with new paradigms to potentiate immunotherapy in this and other immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor settings that are historically unresponsive to ICB therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,Natural killer cells,EZH2,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marcus Ruscetti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Despite its importance in metastasis and residual disease, few studies have been able to successfully model or characterize dormancy within melanoma. Here, we show that age-related changes in the lung microenvironment facilitate a permissive niche for efficient outgrowth of disseminated dormant tumor cells, in contrast to the aged skin, where age-related changes suppress melanoma growth but drive dissemination. A model of melanoma progression that addresses these microenvironmental complexities is the phenotype switching model, which argues that melanoma cells switch between a proliferative cell state and a slower-cycling, invasive state. We have previously shown that dermal fibroblasts are key orchestrators of promoting phenotype switching in primary melanoma tumors via changes in the secretion of soluble factors during aging. Our new data identify Wnt5A as a master regulator of activating melanoma DCC dormancy within the lung, which initially enables efficient dissemination and seeding of melanoma cells in metastatic niches. Age-induced reprogramming of lung fibroblasts increases their secretion of soluble Wnt factors enabling efficient metastatic outgrowth. Overall, we find that age-induced changes in distal metastatic microenvironments promotes efficient reactivation of dormant melanoma cells in the lung. Further these changes are also reflected in the response of tumor cells to therapy, linking dormancy to recurrent disease.<b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Aging,Disseminated tumor cells,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ashani T.
