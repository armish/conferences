[{"Abstract":"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS signaling through the downstream mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade regulate cell proliferation and survival. The SHOC2 holophosphatase functions as a key regulator of RTK-RAS signaling by removing an inhibitory phosphorylation on RAF family proteins to potentiate MAPK signaling. SHOC2 forms a ternary complex with MRAS and PP1C, and human germline gain-of-function mutations of this complex result in congenital RASopathy syndromes. However, the structure and the assembly of this complex are poorly understood. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to resolve the structure of the SHOC2-PP1C-MRAS holophosphatase to 2.9&#197; resolution. Furthermore, we define the biophysical principles of SHOC2 holoenzyme interactions, elucidate the assembly order of the complex, and systematically interrogate the functional consequences of nearly all possible missense variants of SHOC2 through deep mutational scanning. We demonstrate that SHOC2 binds PP1C and MRAS through a concave surface created by the leucine-rich repeat region and further engages PP1C through the N-terminal disordered region containing a degenerate RVxF motif. Initial complex formation is mediated by SHOC2-PP1C interactions and is stabilized by binding of GTP-loaded MRAS. These observations define how clinical mutants in Noonan-like syndrome and cancer stabilize interactions of complex members to enhance holophosphatase activity. Together, this integrative structure-function model comprehensively defines key binding interactions within the SHOC2 holophosphatase, informing therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Raf,Ras,Structure-activity relationships,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason Kwon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Behnoush Hajian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuemin Bian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alvaro Amor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Fuller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cara Fraley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Baker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan So<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Mayhew<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abbey Sykes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Persky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoping Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Root<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Perry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Lemke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Hahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Aguirre<\/i><\/presenter>.

SCLC does not present driver oncogenes involved in the regulation of kinase signaling, which makes these tumors hard to treat. The few available treatments yield responses early, but relapse occurs and they become resistant. Due to the poor efficacy of therapies, research in SCLC had been moved to the background, with basically no progress over the past decades. Mutations in the RAS-ERK pathway, elevating ERK activity and enhancing tumorigenesis, are common in other types of cancer, including NSCLC. Nevertheless, they are rare in SCLC. Indeed, previous studies demonstrated that ERK activation interferes with growth of SCLC. However, the mechanism by which ERK hinders tumor progression has not been defined yet. One of the most important players in SCLC and other NE tumors is the transcription factor ASCL1, essential for their survival. It has been reported that ASCL1 increases DUSP6 transcription with the consequent ERK activity suppression. Its downregulation affects cell cycle progression and survival. Conversely, inhibition of ERK activation by MEK inhibitors increases ASCL1 mRNA levels. Previous studies in our laboratory suggested that DUSP6 has a major role in a subset of SCLC and NSCLC-NE cell lines. Inhibition of DUSP6 enhances ERK signaling and significantly decreases survival of NE lung tumor cells. We have considered DUSP6 a good candidate to try to understand the mechanism by which ERK interferes with survival. However, hurdles in studying DUSP6 in SCLC include off-target effects of inhibitors and difficulty of gene-edited cell lines. To date, we have been able to generate a DUSP6 KO NSCLC-NE cell line which shows a clear drop in proliferation. Also, the overexpression of ERK or a constitutively active MEK1 mutant in a few SCLC, NE-NSCLC and MEK inhibitor-insensitive squamous lung cancer cell lines render a decrease in survival. DUSP6 is a cytoplasmic anchor for ERK and may reduce the ability of ERK to suppress ASCL1 transcription. For this reason, we are working on studying the effect on survival of ERK localization in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. With our ongoing experiments we are defining the conditions to examine transcriptional impact of ERK on SCLC. Discovering molecular events antagonized by the ERK pathway in SCLC will reveal novel targets controlling the inhibitory mechanisms. One of the SCLC major questions of translational relevance is what are the mechanisms upholding the development of chemoresistance, where the ERK pathway seems to be involved. Hence, the definition of the underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis and therapy resistance will uncover new potential antitumor targets that currently escape our notice. A better understanding of the molecular biology of SCLC will let us find new therapeutic strategies to overcome the impasse in chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5e0a10c-26a6-4bb9-96e1-d615271101ed\/@B03B8ZXv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,Lung cancer,Neuroendocrine tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ana Martin-Vega<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svetlana Eartnest<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John D.

Due to the lack of therapeutics available, it is urgent to identify biomolecular targets to develop more efficient treatments [1]. Depletion and inhibition of the protein kinase <u>W<\/u>ith <u>N<\/u>o <u>L<\/u>ysine (WNK) reduces migration of breast cancer cells, slowing down TNBC metastasis [2][3]. For this reason, WNKs are promising cancer drug targets. Other works suggest WNKs are also targets for the treatment of hypertension and stroke. The main focus of this work is to understand the molecular mechanisms of this family of proteins, which will help to develop more efficient drugs. WNKs are serine-threonine kinases important in ion transport regulation [4]. WNKs are critical intracellular osmosensors, with their function related to an equilibrium between an inactive dimer and an autophosphorylation-competent monomer. The dimer conformation covers phosphorylation sites [5], while simultaneously trapping water molecules [6]. The water trapping feature is hypothesized to be linked to ion pairs and clusters of charges between the Activation loop and the Catalytic loop. To access the role of these ion pairs, we expressed and purified seven mutants of key amino acids, analyzed their activity, phosphorylation state and sensitivity to ions and pressure. Some of these mutants are more monomeric, active and autophosphorylation competent than the wild-type, elucidating the role of these amino acids in the function of WNKs. Interestingly, some mutants are more sensitive to potassium, which confirms the WNK inhibition site for this ion [7].<br \/>[1]B. D.

The mainstay treatment for metastatic PCa patients is androgen-deprivation therapies, including high-affinity androgen receptor antagonists, such as enzalutamide. Unfortunately, most patients develop resistance and relapse with castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). We have previously reported up-regulation of CXCR7, an atypical chemokine receptor, in CRPC. CXCR7 interacts with beta-arrestin (ARRB2), a cytoplasmic scaffold protein, and translocates to the cytoplasm to induce signal transduction and PCa progression. However, much remains to be known regarding CXCR7-driven downstream signaling and its therapeutic targeting in advanced PCa. To unveil CXCR7-downstream signaling, we utilized RNA-seq to profile gene expression. Gene ontology analyses revealed remarkable enrichment of CXCR7-regulated genes in G2\/M cell cycle progression. Comprehensive phospho-proteomics analysis of CXCR7-knockdown PCa cells showed markedly reduced phosphorylation of AURKA substrates. AURKA, a serine\/threonine-protein kinase, is a key regulator of mitosis and G2\/M progression and is frequently upregulated in CRPC and the late-stage neuroendocrine PCa (NEPC). Activated AURKA experiences autophosphorylation and phosphorylates downstream substrates, e.g., TACC3, that mediate proper cell division. Immunoblotting confirmed that CXCR7 depletion reduces phosphorylation of AURKA and TACC3. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed protein-protein interaction between CXCR7 and AURKA, which is mediated by ARRB2. Accordingly, ARRB2-knockdown similarly inhibits AURKA phosphorylation and arrests cell proliferation. Immunofluorescence coupled with confocal imaging demonstrated that CXCR7 is packed into clathrin-coated vesicles and locates in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and perinuclear Golgi complex, which surrounds the centrosomal AURKA and ARRB2. We found that CXCR7 translocates to the Golgi complex along microtubule-dependent trafficking. Finally, we found that pharmacological inhibitors of AURKA abolish CXCR7-driven PCa cell proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results describe for the first time that the CXCR7-ARRB2 complex interacts with AURKA and promotes its activation. Our data suggest that AURKA-targeting is a promising therapeutic strategy for CRPC and NEPC with CXCR7 up-regulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/558eb6f6-717b-4f98-ae67-637bfa46c6cf\/@B03B8ZXv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Aurora kinase,Cell growth,Chemokine receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Galina Gritsina<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhuoyuan Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ka Wing Fong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaodong Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Changsheng Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jindan Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Particularly when studying disease, understanding differences in diverse cells is essential thus single-cell resolution is a necessity due to significant cellular heterogeneity. High-throughput droplet- and microfluidic-based approaches for performing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) are invaluable techniques for uncovering changes in cells such as differential gene expression and epigenetic states in cancer research. A challenge for scRNA-seq, however, is sample preparation as typically tissues must be processed immediately after collection. We and others have reported alternative approaches to stabilize samples prior to analysis such as cryopreservation of cells and tissues and methanol-based fixation of cells. However, the inclusion of these approaches is still limited in many settings due to the challenging logistics involved in sample collection. To further broaden the ability of researchers to deploy scRNA-seq, we report our experiences from testing a pre-commercial workflow developed by 10x Genomics to resolve these sample management limitations. The use of paraformaldehyde (PFA) to fix samples at the collection site allows samples to be transported to remote laboratories for downstream processing without sacrificing integrity or data quality. This advance has enabled new possibilities for sample accessibility, throughput, and batched analysis in basic and translational research settings. Furthermore, this approach also allows for analysis of transcriptome-wide gene expression at high sensitivity with simultaneous cellular readouts. Here we report a case study comparing the PFA method to standard approaches, and highlight advantages and potential applications previously not possible with reported sample preparation strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e0044c7f-44c0-47a2-9d69-8dd142a26036\/@B03B8ZXv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Gene expression profiling,Cell fixation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>David Corney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongjun Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Stephens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Andrea O'Hara<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laure Turner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Mozdzierz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haythem Latif<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ginger Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>.

Patients with advanced form of the disease become resistant to ADT and progress to a lethal phenotype called Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Neuropilin-2 is upregulated in advanced prostate cancer. It has been implicated in decreasing the overall survival of such patients by inducing therapy-resistance.<br \/>Significance: Understanding how NRP2 is differentially expressed will uncover molecular pathways that can be targeted to develop a specific treatment strategy for better management of patients.<br \/>Experimental Design: We checked NRP2 expression in different prostate cancer cell lines {LNCaP, C4-2 and C4-2 P53\/RB1 null cells (DKD cells)} and the level of methylation of the NRP2 promoter in these cells by pyrosequencing. We demethylated the NRP2 promoter by treatment with 5&#8217;Azacytidine and checked NRP2 mRNA expression. We analyzed the NRP2 promoter activity under demethylated conditions by transfecting cells with a demethylated NRP2 promoter construct using a GLuc dual-luciferase assay. Using Biobase we found DNA sequences for binding of transcription factors within the NRP2 promoter. RNA-Seq, RT-PCR was performed to identify potential transcription factors of NRP2(highly expressed in DKD cells). To validate SOX2 as a transcription factor for NRP2, we tested its binding to NRP2 promoter by ChIP-q-PCR. Requirement of SOX2 in transcribing NRP2 mRNA in C4-2 and DKD cells was tested by both knocking down or ectopically expressing SOX2. To determine whether demethylation of NRP2 promoter is a prerequisite for SOX2 binding, SOX2 was overexpressed in LNCaP cells following 5&#8217;Azacytidine and monitored the change in the NRP2 expression.<br \/>Results: NRP2 expression was low in LNCaP cells. It steadily increased in C4-2 cells with a steep rise in the DKD cells. Pyrosequencing showed a high level of DNA methylation in LNCaP cells compared to C4-2 cells. On treatment with 5&#8217;Azacytidine, NRP2 mRNA expression was upregulated in the LNCaP cells and it significantly rose in the C4-2 cells. Our dual-luciferase assay showed us that in C4-2 cells, the promoter activity of NRP2 upon demethylation went up causing a significant rise in Luciferase expression. RNA-seq and RT-PCR analysis showed high SOX2 levels in DKD cells indicating that SOX2 might play a role in elevating NRP2 expression in these cells. ChIP q-PCR indicated enriched binding of SOX2 in the NRP2 promoter in DKD cells. On silencing SOX2 in DKD cells, the expression of NRP2 was decreased. Analogous to this finding, overexpressing SOX2 in C4-2 cells caused significant rise in NRP2 expression, whereas in LNCaP cells, there was no change. Demethylation of NRP2 promoter and simultaneous overexpression of SOX2 in LNCaP lead to a significant increase in NRP2 mRNA suggesting the requirement of demethylated NRP2 promoter for SOX2 function.<br \/>Conclusion: The differential expression of NRP2 in advanced prostate cancer is a two-step process of initial demethylation of the DNA in the NRP2 promoter region, followed by binding of SOX2","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b80dd934-c722-4081-9e5b-ce1edb63c745\/@B03B8ZXv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-03 Mechanisms of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genitourinary cancers: prostate,Cancer markers,Transcription factor,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanika Bodas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ridwan Islam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sreyashi Bhattacharya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juhi Mishra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dipanwita Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Muders<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samikshan Dutta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin A.

AR-mediated overexpression of ERG hijacks AR inhibiting lineage-specific differentiation and increases cell invasion and migration. <i>In vivo<\/i> work revealed a causal role of ERG in initiating prostate cancer. Notably, <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models of CRPC endogenously bearing <i>T2ERG<\/i> depend on ERG activity for proliferation and survival. Thus, pursuing the development of ERG-based therapeutic strategies represents a promising route for CRPC treatment, although major challenges in targeting transcription factors such as ERG have been reported. Yet, synthetic lethality approaches including genome-wide loss-of-function screens can be employed to avoid direct ERG targeting. Here, we used metastatic PCa cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1 and DU145) engineered with inducible systems to overexpress ERG to show that high levels of ERG expression lead to an apparent reduction in the fitness of AR-positive and negative cells. Prolonged overexpression of a mutant form of ERG, which is not able to bind DNA, does not affect cell viability indicating that ERG DNA binding and transcriptional activity are necessary for the induction of this phenotype. The ERG-mediated reduction in cellular fitness is influenced by cell adhesion and is characterized by cell cycle arrest mediated by several cell cycle inhibitors induced by ERG. As revealed by gene expression analyses and functional assays, ERG induces a less proliferative, more dedifferentiated and invasive phenotype, which lead to an apparent reduction of cellular fitness <i>in vitro<\/i>, but is characteristic of more aggressive tumor cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. Altogether, these results underscore the reliability of the developed <i>in vitro<\/i> models for ERG activity, which will be used for screening to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities unlocked by ERG in CRPC. Importantly, we also uncovered confounding factors (i.e. loss of ERG-positive cells not due to screen selection) that could impinge on the results arising from <i>in vitro<\/i> screens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/74b1f5c8-9341-4adf-962f-7c0e950cef9c\/@C03B8ZXw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,ERG,EMT,SCREENING,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Francesca Lorenzin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giulia Fracassi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yari Ciani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paola Gasperini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Rickman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Demichelis<\/i><\/presenter>.

This NE development is associated with chromatin reprogramming underlying epigenetic alterations and changes in transcriptional network. Clinically, NE development follows a poorer progression with multifaceted therapeutic challenges. Current lack of effective understanding of this NE trans-differentiation process limits the stratification of therapeutic window with further worsened patient management. The following study aims to identify the sequential molecular players responsible for therapy resistant NE like development.<br \/>Objective: The primary objective of this study is to understand how chromatin modifications along with epigenetic regulation dictates the establishment of NE trans-differentiation process in Prostate Cancer in response to Androgen Receptor blockade therapy.<br \/>Methods: We generated various NE-like cell lines either by genetic modification or therapeutic selection. We performed RNA Seq, ATAC Seq and acetylated Histone (H3K18 and H3K27) ChIP Seq in our developed NE and adenocarcinoma cell lines. We next compared ATAC Seq and Acetylated histone ChIP Seq with RNA Seq in C4-2B and C4-2BER.<br \/>Results:<br \/>Our ATAC Seq and acetylated histone footprints (Ac H3K18 and Ac H3K27 ChIP Seq) analyses revealed an enhanced chromatin accessibility during adenocarcinoma to NE transformation. Overlapping RNA seq results further suggested newly transcribed neuronal genes with higher degrees of promoter accessibility. Transcription Factor scanning analysis among newly active gene promoters revealed preferential binding of Pax5, whose expression has been validated to be selectively occurring in NE lineage unlike adenocarcinoma. Further analysis of Pax5 promoter site suggested that changes in 5-hydroxymethylation pattern during adenocarcinoma to NE transformation guided the recruitment of PBX1 at Pax5 promoter. Validating NE patient expression in silico supported that PBX1\/Pax5 expressions are selective in NE lineage development.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study concludes that specific chromatin alterations guide the recruitment of PBX1 to upregulate Pax5 to maintain a therapy resistant neuronal surrounding in NE-like prostate cancer development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bf242e12-4112-4d74-9920-ff042b080e0f\/@C03B8ZXw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Neuroendocrine trans-differentiation,Chromatin modifications, Transcriptional network,ATAC Seq, acetylated histone ChIP Seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sreyashi Bhattacharya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ridwan Islam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanika Bodas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juhi Mishra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dipanwita Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaustubh Datta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samikshan Dutta<\/i><\/presenter>.

Aberrant molecular signaling mechanisms mediated by the Androgen Receptor (AR) are attributed as the main culprits for the initiation and progression of PCa, and research efforts have focused on developing strategies to directly target the AR. In an alternative approach, molecular chaperones that are critical for the maturation and signaling of the AR have emerged as potential therapeutic targets. Our lab has demonstrated the potential of inhibitors that target AR cochaperones, FKBP51 and FKBP52, in PCa cells. Previously, FKBP51 and FKBP52 have been shown to play a role in cell proliferation and survival, steroid hormone receptor maturation, and other mechanisms highly implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the protein-protein interactions that regulate FKBP51 and FKBP52-mediated AR function in PCa. We hypothesize that unknown interactors cooperate with FKBP51 and FKBP52 to promote PCa progression via the AR signaling pathways. Here, we performed a series of experiments aimed to identify and characterize auxiliary proteins influencing FKBP51- and FKBP52-mediated AR activity. Ultimately, our goal is to define novel protein interactions involved in AR-mediated PCa progression for therapeutic intervention.<br \/>Methods: We implemented tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis in 22RV1 PCa cells using FKBP51 and FKBP52 as bait. The spectral counts of proteins identified were then used to analyze protein-protein interactions through the IDEP workflow software. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis was used to generate a STRING interaction network. Protein interactions of interest were then validated via reciprocal immunoprecipitations.<br \/>Results: This interactome analysis resulted in 353 IDs for FKBP51 and FKBP52 interactors. Heatmaps representing top 100 interactors were generated for both bait proteins. Members of the peroxiredoxin family, implicated in development of PCa and resistance to treatment, are among the top candidates of interest resulting from this interactome.<br \/>Conclusion: This analysis aims to provide important insights into the androgen signaling milieu, which can be applied in the development of novel treatments targeting AR interacting partners in PCa progression. This study contributes to the growing list of functionally diverse proteins that help modulate AR transcriptional activity, and supports the idea that AR signaling is dynamic with numerous molecules involved in the aberrant activation of AR in prostate-tumor cells","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec583dfc-cda6-45c4-9c09-b0aa87777cb2\/@C03B8ZXw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Prostate cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Olga B.

This work investigates the contribution of progranulin to the maintenance of and conversion between the SW13 subtypes. A prognostic biomarker in cancer, progranulin is a pleotropic signaling molecule composed of 7 highly conserved granulin repeats. Each granulin unit has independent and sometimes opposing activity in the regulation of diverse cellular activities including proliferation, chemoresistance, lysosomal function, migration, wound healing, and inflammation. Thus, the ultimate biological activity of progranulin is context-dependent as it relies on the expression of diverse intracellular and extracellular proteases. Treatment with exogenous progranulin increases growth of SW13- cells but not SW13+ cells, a finding which suggests differential processing. As the metastatic SW13+ subtype produces more progranulin than the SW13- subtype, these data are consistent with an inability of SW13+ to process endogenous progranulin to the mitogenic granulin unit(s). Immunoblotting with antibodies specific for granulin repeats indicates that progranulin is processed differently in each subtype. In this work, we focused on lysosomes as a potential site for differential processing of progranulin for several reasons. First, lysosomes play a role in EMT. Second, lysosomal proteases have been shown to process progranulin and progranulin itself plays a role in lysosome maturation. Finally, preliminary data suggest that there are differences in lysosomal function and pH between the two subtypes. Ongoing experiments address the benefits of lysosomal acidification and the role that differential processing of progranulin may play on the maintenance and interconversion of the SW13 subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49aff1d0-8698-4c94-8e69-a5ebb85abc9c\/@C03B8ZXw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Growth factor,Inflammation,Lysosome,Cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chika Okonya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>McKale R.

EGFR has numerous kinase-independent roles, one of which is accomplished through the Sorting Nexin-dependent retrotranslocation of EGFR to the nucleus, which is observed in some metastatic cancers and therapeutically resistant disease. Here, we have utilized the BAR domain of Sorting Nexin 1 to create a peptide-based therapeutic (cSNX1.3) that promotes cell death in EGFR-expressing cancer. We evaluated the efficacy of cSNX1.3 in tumor-bearing WAP-TGF&#945; transgenic mice (an EGFR-dependent model of breast cancer), where cSNX1.3 treatment resulted in significant tumor regression without observable toxicity. Evaluation of remaining tumor tissues found evidence of increased PARP cleavage, suggesting apoptotic tumor cell death. To evaluate the mechanism of action for cSNX1.3, we found that cSNX1.3 binds the C-terminus of the EGFR kinase domain at an interface site opposite the ATP binding domain with a <i>K<\/i><sub>d<\/sub> of ~4.0 &#181;M. <i>In vitro<\/i> analysis found that cSNX1.3 inhibits both long-term EGF-dependent AKT and ERK activation, as well as nuclear localization of EGFR. To determine specificity, we evaluated cancer cell lines expressing wildtype EGFR (MDA-MB-468, BT20 and A549), mutant EGFR (H1975) and non-transformed lines (CHO and MCF10A). Only transformed lines expressing wildtype EGFR responded to cSNX1.3, while mutant EGFR and normal cells responded better to the EGFR kinase inhibitor (Sapitinib). Phenotypically, cSNX1.3 inhibits EGF-, NRG-, and HGF-dependent migration, but not HA-dependent migration. Together, these data indicate that targeting retrotranslocation of EGFR may be a potent therapeutic for RTK-active cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-03 Nuclear oncoproteins and tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Nuclear translocation,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ben Atwell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

CAFs are comprised of heterogeneous subpopulations of activated fibroblasts, including myofibroblastic, inflammatory, or immunosuppressive CAFs. In this study, we sought to identify subpopulations of CAFs isolated from human lung adenocarcinomas and describe their transcriptomic as well as functional characteristics through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subsequent bioinformatics analyses.<br \/>Methods: We isolated and cultured two types of CAFs. Total CAFs were isolated after negative selection using cell-type-specific antibodies against lymphocytes (CD45), macrophages (CD68), endothelial cells (CD31), and epithelial cells (Ep-CAM). THY1+ CAFs were isolated after additional selection based on CAF-specific marker THY1. Total CAFs (n=5,139 cells) and THY1+ CAFs (n=4,038 cells) were subjected to 10X Genomics scRNA-seq. scRNA-seq data were then integrated and analyzed using the Seurat method.<br \/>Results: Cell trajectory analysis of combined total and THY1+ CAFs revealed two branching points with five distinct branches. Based on Gene Ontology analysis, we denoted Branch 1 as &#8220;immunosuppressive&#8221;, Branch 2 as &#8220;neoantigen-presenting&#8221;, Branch 4 as &#8220;myofibroblastic&#8221;, and Branch 5 as &#8220;proliferative&#8221; CAFs. We selected representative branch-specific markers and measured their expression levels in total and THY1+ CAFs. We also investigated the effects of these markers on CAF activity under co-culture with lung cancer cells.<br \/>Conclusions: This study describes novel subpopulations of CAFs in lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting their potential value as therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3fc744b9-bd38-461e-adbe-f982b2515ce8\/@C03B8ZXw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Single cell,Lung adenocarcinoma,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Daeseung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong Seon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Seoree Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Hoon Chun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Jun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inyoung Cheon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sieun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung Sook Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soon Auck Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hye Sung Won<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keunsoo Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young-Ho Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoon Ho Ko<\/i><\/presenter>.

B-cell CLL\/lymphoma 9 protein (BCL9), a co-activator of &#946;-catenin transcriptional activity, is overexpressed in many tumors and facilitates &#946;-catenin nuclear localization. Disruption of the &#946;-catenin and BCL9 interaction has been shown genetically to suppress oncogenic Wnt\/&#946;-catenin transcription, without impacting &#946;-catenin homeostatic functions, and represents a powerful approach to inhibit this previously &#8216;undruggable&#8217; target. Here, we investigate the impact of ST316, a peptide antagonist of &#946;-catenin that inhibits its interaction with BCL9, on cells displaying hyperactivation of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway. Administration of ST316 to HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells, which carry a degradation-escape,&nbsp;gain-of-function mutation in &#946;-catenin, dramatically reduced nuclear &#946;-catenin localization. Furthermore, ST316-mediated loss of nuclear &#946;-catenin was associated with a significant decrease in the expression of Wnt\/&#946;-catenin target genes in HCT116 cells stimulated with Wnt3a, including Axin2, hTCF7, Fox01 and CDK4. ST316 reduced &#946;-catenin target gene expression by up to &#8764;70%, whereas no impact was observed following administration of a negative control peptide. A significant anti-proliferative and dose-dependent cytotoxic effect was observed on HCT116 cells 48 hours post ST316 exposure, with an EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 4.4 &#181;M, and on patient-derived, APC-mutant colorectal adenocarcinoma and breast carcinoma cells 72 hours post ST316 exposure, with EC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 1.5 to 2.6 &#181;M. To extend these findings, we investigated the impact of ST316 on HCT116 tumors in vivo. ST316 (5 mg\/kg) administered three times weekly by subcutaneous injection resulted in 99.6% tumor growth inhibition vs. vehicle controls (p&#60;0.05), while a negative control peptide had no significant impact on tumor growth. These data demonstrate the potential of ST316 as a potent therapeutic candidate for Wnt\/&#946;-catenin-dependent cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d07d2a35-51ff-43ed-959b-983959583ecc\/@D03B8ZXx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peptides,&#946;-catenin,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lila Ghamsari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erin Gallagher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emad Darvishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siok Leong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Koester<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rick Ramirez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jerel Gonzales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gene Merutka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barry Kappel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jim A.
