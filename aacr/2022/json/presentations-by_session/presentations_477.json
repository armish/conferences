Precursor conditions are incidentally diagnosed and require invasive bone marrow (BM) biopsies for complete characterization, highlighting the urgent need for improved early detection methods. Minimally invasive blood biopsies to measure circulating multiple myeloma cells (CMMCs) as markers of MM disease development are a promising solution to this unmet need. Here, we present our novel method CatchTheFISH, for whole genome sequencing (WGS) of CMMCs that enables genomic profiling and WGS based cytogenetic analyses from enriched liquid biopsy samples. Application of WGS in a cohort of 20 patients, revealed CMMCs were of tumor origin and able to faithfully match BM sequencing results and detect 100% of clinically reported events.<br \/>Methods: Peripheral blood from 110 SMM patients from the PCROWD observational study (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute IRB #14-174) was collected and processed on CellSearch system (Menarini Silicon Biosystems), with enrichment and enumeration of CMMCs based on CD138<sup>+<\/sup>38<sup>+<\/sup>CD45<sup>-<\/sup>19<sup>-<\/sup> immunophenotype. In 20 patients, CMMCs and white blood cells were sorted for library construction, quantification and WGS on Illumina NovaSeq6000. Mutation analyses were performed with the cancer genome analysis pipelines of the Broad Institute.<br \/>Results: CMMCs were detected in 84% of SMM patients enrolled in the study, with a median count of 13 CMMCs (range 0 to 43836). We first demonstrated the concordance of WGS results obtained from CMMCs with BM. In 100% of patients tested with paired BM and CMMCs (n = 8), we observed full agreement in structural event calling between our samples and clinical reports, including translocations and CNAs (trisomies, tetrasomy, monosomy 13 and 1q gain\/amplification). Next, we showed WGS of CMMCs provided increased diagnostic yield compared to BM biopsy for the detection of structural events and MM-associated driver mutations. In 7 patients (88%) we detected additional aberrations not found by FISH. Unknown translocation events of <i>IGH-MYC<\/i> and t(14;20) were distinguished in two patients. Additionally, our method enabled detection of MM driver mutations. Three patients (38%) were found to harbor RAS mutations (<i>KRAS<\/i> and <i>NRAS<\/i>) in BM samples, which were also validated in matched CMMCs. Finally, we assessed a validation cohort of 12 SMM patients with CMMCs only. WGS detected comprehensive mutation data across all scales including clinically relevant translocations, trisomies, CNAs and mutations.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings provide proof of principle that capture and genomic profiling of CMMCs could be a robust surrogate to BM biopsy, allowing minimally invasive detection and monitoring of disease, unlocking the clinical potential of liquid biopsies for MM diagnostics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Circulating tumor cells,Whole genome sequencing,Cancer detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ankit K.

MM is almost always preceded by the precursor stage smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). BM biopsies are useful to monitor disease progression, but they are invasive and not routinely collected from patients for disease monitoring during precursor stages. Profiling circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood (PB) could aid early detection, disease monitoring, and biomarker identification to predict patients at high risk of progression that may benefit from early therapeutic intervention.<br \/>Methods: Paired PB and BM aspirates were collected from 40 SMM patients enrolled in the PCROWD study (IRB #14-174) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Malignant PCs were enriched by magnetic bead-based methods and underwent 5&#8217; single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell B-cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) (10x Genomics).<br \/>Results: We analyzed 105,246 BM PCs and 33,234 PB PCs from 15 patients. To differentiate malignant from normal PCs, we used clonal V(D)J rearrangements, assessed by concurrent scBCR-seq. A total of 86,986 BM tumor cells and 8,718 CTCs were captured. A median of 5, 26, and 47 CTCs were present per mL of blood from low, intermediate, and high-risk SMM patients as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) &#8220;20\/2\/20&#8221; criteria, suggesting sequencing-based CTC enumeration corresponds to prognosis. High levels of driver genes commonly upregulated in patients with specific translocations, including <i>CCND1<\/i> and <i>MAF<\/i>, were detected in both BM tumor and CTC clusters in 3 patients with t(11;14) and t(14;16) confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) clinical testing, and 2 additional patients with inconclusive FISH results (Wilcoxon, q &#60;10<sup>-3<\/sup>), supporting the idea of CTC-based prognostication. Differential expression (DE) analysis revealed 8 genes that were significantly upregulated and 3 genes that were significantly downregulated in CTCs compared to BM tumor cells robustly across 15 paired samples. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed genes DE in CTCs are associated with TNF-&#945; and NF-&#954;B signaling, which are commonly induced by extrinsic factors in the bone marrow milieu, providing insight into the biology of tumor cell circulation.<br \/>Conclusions: This study highlights the utility of scRNA-seq for molecular profiling of CTCs, even in asymptomatic low tumor burden disease. Additional analyses are ongoing in the expanded cohort of 40 patients with paired samples to help gain further insight into CTC heterogeneity. Overall, this study will help enable the design of new molecular liquid biopsy-based approaches to diagnosis, disease monitoring, and biological insights to improve treatment strategies for precursor myeloma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Single cell,Multiple myeloma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth D.

However, due to the heterogeneity and huge size of digitized pathology slides, it has been a challenging problem to quantify TILs-related features in whole slide images (WSI). This study aimed to explore the impact of spatial distribution of TILs quantified by deep learning (DL) approaches based on digitalized WSI stained with hematoxylin and eosin in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The cancer and TILs regions are first separately identified by deep learning models in the WSI. The TILs densities at tumor invasive margins are then quantified by image analysis algorithms and used for prognosis of progression-free survival (PFS) in CRC patients. The prognostic impact of spatial distributions of TILs in CRC patients was explored in the Yonsei cohort (n=180) and validated in the TCGA cohort (n=268). Two experienced pathologists manually measured TILs at the most invasive margin as 0-3 by the Klintrup-M&#228;kinen (KM) grading method and compared to DL approaches. On multivariate analysis, TILs densities within 200&#181;m of the invasive margin (f_im200) was remained as the most significant prognostic factor for PFS (HR 0.004 [95% CI, 0.0001-0.1502], <i>p<\/i>=.002) in the Yonsei cohort. On multivariate analysis using the TCGA dataset, f_im200 retained prognostic significance for PFS (HR 0.031, [95% CI 0.001-0.645], <i>p<\/i>=.024). Inter-observer agreement of manual KM grading was insignificant in both cohorts. The survival analysis by pathologists&#8217; manual KM grading showed statistically significant different PFS from the TCGA cohort, but not the Yonsei cohort. In summary, automated quantification of TILs at the invasive margin showed a prognostic utility to predict PFS, and could provide reproducible TILs density measurement in CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Prognosis,Deep learning,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hongming Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoon Jin Cha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean Clemenceau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinhwan Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung Hak Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeonghyun Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Tae Hyun Hwang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Our analyses established tumour mutation burden (TMB) as the strongest predictor of CPI response, alongside clonal TMB and CXCL9 expression. However, over half of the patients in our cohort who responded to CPI treatment did not have high-TMB and showed no evidence of oncogenic viral infections, hence suggesting alternative sources of antigen could be driving the immune response. As well as this, data from the CPI1000 cohort suggested that the biomarkers identified in an extensive systematic review only accounted for ~60% of the variance in CPI response, promoting the search for non-classical sources of antigen.<br \/>Extending the cohort to encompass 2500+ patients, using available genomic and transcriptomic data from checkpoint inhibitor trials and industry partners, the previously published multivariate predictor will be further validated in a larger patient cohort inclusive of more cancer types. The CPI1000 cohort utilised primarily whole exome-sequencing therefore, had limited ability to discern non-coding sources of tumour antigen and cell-type specific predictors of response. The CPI2500+ cohort will incorporate several additional cohorts as well as single-cell and T-cell reactivity data. The raw data will be harmonised across studies and processed using a robust bioinformatics pipeline. As well as this, alternative (non-classical) sources of tumour specific antigen will be studied. Alternative sources of antigen can originate from a diverse range of biological processes including retained introns, stop codon loss mutations and cancer associated bacterial\/viral epitopes. Data from this exploratory analysis will be coupled with peptide reactivity assays from local UCL patient TIL (tumour infiltrating lymphocyte) and PMBC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) samples to validate immunogenicity.<br \/>Current analysis has identified a novel subgroup of CPI-responders with low-TMB who have significantly higher rates of microbial diversity, consistent with a diverse tumour microbiome providing a source of immunogenic antigens in the absence of high-TMB. Here we will present insights from CPI2500+ and highlight the importance of emerging non-classical sources of tumour specific antigen.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Krupa Thakkar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danwen Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongui Cha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas B.

Our previous study demonstrated a distinct transcriptomic and immunologic landscape amongst the phenotypes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it has not been fully investigated in other cancers. Here, we explore the immune profiles and clinical outcomes between the three immune phenotypes in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tissue H&#38;E slide images, sequencing data, and clinical data were utilized from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Lunit-SCOPE IO was trained with multi-cancer 3,166 H&#38;E whole slide images annotated by pathologists. Based on the proportion of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) highly conserved either in cancer epithelium (CE) or cancer stroma (CS), Lunit-SCOPE IO classifies tumors as <i>immune-inflamed<\/i> and <i>excluded<\/i>, respectively. Also, it classifies tumors with low TIL density in CE and CS as <i>immune-desert<\/i>.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Among 486 patients with UCEC, the frequency of immune-inflamed, excluded and desert was 174 (35.8%), 160 (32.9%), and 156 (32%), respectively. In the three subgroup comparison, immune-inflamed was associated with the best survival outcome and -excluded was associated with the worst survival outcome (<i>Inflamed<\/i> vs <i>excluded<\/i>, HR 0.30 95% CI 0.17-0.55, p&#60;.001; <i>desert<\/i> vs <i>excluded<\/i>, HR 0.50 95% CI 0.30-0.84, p=0.009). Likewise, <i>inflamed<\/i> subtype showed better overall survival (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25-0.75, p=0.003) compared to others. In microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) tumors, we observed a similar tendency of improved overall survival in the tumors of <i>inflamed<\/i> subtype, both compared to the <i>excluded<\/i> subtype and to a combination of other subtypes. (<i>Inflamed<\/i> vs <i>excluded<\/i>, HR 0.18 95% CI 0.05-0.73, p=0.017; <i>inflamed<\/i> vs others, HR 0.21 95% CI 0.06-0.72, p=0.014). <i>Immune-inflamed<\/i> had significantly higher cytolytic activity (<i>Inflamed<\/i> 7.25 vs others 6.34, p&#60;.001) and was associated with higher PD-L1 expression (<i>Inflamed<\/i> 19.03 vs others 10.7, p=0.003) and CTLA4 expression (<i>Inflamed<\/i> 60.62 vs others 31.5, p&#60;.001). <i>Immune-inflamed<\/i> had a higher proportion of CD8 positive T cell (<i>Inflamed<\/i> 16.7% vs 12.8%, p&#60;.001) and M1 macrophage (<i>Inflamed<\/i> 3.9% vs others 2.8%, p&#60;.001) and a lower proportion of M2 macrophage (<i>Inflamed<\/i> 15% vs others 17.9%, p&#60;.001).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The three tissue phenomic subtypes showed distinct immune profiles and clinical outcomes, with <i>immune-inflamed<\/i> having the best overall survival outcome. In particular, non-inflamed group was associated with worse overall survival even in MSI-H tumors deemed to have more favorable prognosis compared to MSS tumors. Given the definite differences in the survival outcome, tissue H&#38;E based tumor microenvironment classification may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in UCEC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Prognostic markers,Tumor microenvironment,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Horyun Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leeseul Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinah Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeun Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyung-Gyo Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Hyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gahyun Gim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanghoon Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gahee Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soo Ick Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergio Pereira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donggeun Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyunghyun Paeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chan-Young Ock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Kwang Chae<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, as intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is pervasive in cancer we investigated the impact of ITH on established and putative biomarkers predictive of immunotherapy response. We have used whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and PDL1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) derived from the multiregion treatment na&#239;ve TRACERx cohort to investigate this.<br \/>Whole exome sequencing data was available for 432 primary tumours from 421 patients with greater than 1500 unique tumour regions. Tumour mutational burden (TMB) was calculated using best practice guidelines from the TMB harmonisation project. Using the FDA approved threshold of &#8805; 10 mutations per megabase to define high TMB we found that 41% of patients with high TMB had at least one region with &#60;10 mutation per megabase. This could result in misclassification of patients so we modelled increased sampling in this cohort and found that at least 5 spatially separated samples would be required to ensure no patients are misclassified. Contrary to the published literature we did not find TMB was confounded by tumour purity. Multi-region PDL1 IHC data using the FDA approved companion diagnostic assay (22c3) was available for 132 spatially separated tumour regions from 36 patients. Tumour regions were scored according to the established tumour proportion scoring system (&#8805;50%, 49-1%, &#60;1 %). Using only a single sample 31% of patients would have been misclassified. Finally, we investigated several putative transcriptomic biomarkers including 10 single genes (e.g. CXCL9), 15 expression signatures (e.g cytolytic score, TIDE) and 2 tumour microenvironment classification systems. We found that 20-45% of these putative biomarkers were discordant when applied to multi-region data and this increased with the number of tumour regions per patients but was not impacted by tumour purity or sequencing depth. To investigate this further we compared the mean geneset RNA-ITH score between a geneset of all the immune biomarker genes with 100 randomly selected non-immune, but expressed, genesets. The immune biomarker gene set was subject to significantly more intra tumour heterogeneity of expression (Mean RNA-ITH Score 0.50 vs 0.31 p=6.4e-12).<br \/>In conclusion we demonstrate significant heterogeneity of immune biomarkers in NSCLC and in particular a lack of robustness of expression-based predictors of response to immunotherapy. This highlights the need for biomarkers that are robust to intra-tumour heterogeneity and sampling bias or the need for more representative tumour sampling techniques.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Tumor mutational burden,PD-L1,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Crispin T.

However, patient response is heterogeneous, and the molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance are not well elucidated.<br \/>To identify clinically meaningful mechanisms of treatment resistance, we performed transcriptome analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from mCRPC patients enrolled in two independent prospective clinical trials: PROPHECY, a clinical study of patients (n=118) treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide followed by docetaxel; and TAXYNERGY where patients were randomized to docetaxel or cabazitaxel treatment. CTCs were obtained at baseline (before treatment), on treatment and at progression and their comprehensive transcriptomic analysis was correlated with clinical outcomes. To uncover potential involvement of the circulating immune macroenvironment (CIME) in treatment resistance, we performed transcriptomic analysis of matching peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using an established, rigorous, blood-derived transcriptional modular framework.<br \/>In PROPHECY, CTC RNA-seq identified that RB loss concurrently with enhanced E2F signaling networks were associated with intrinsic ARSi resistance. Using single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) score, we identified that the RB\/E2F common signature at baseline was associated with short PFS (median PFS=6.5 months) and OS (median OS=24.5 months) (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.5; 95% CI 1.5-8.2) in men with mCRPC. We further developed a BRCA-loss transcriptional signature, and validated it in the SU2C mCRPC patient cohort, expanding the identification of patients with BRCA-loss phenotypes beyond genomic loss. Applying this signature to PROPHECY baseline samples, we showed that men with high BRCA-loss scores experienced shorter OS (HR=2.42; 95% CI=1-5.9). Through the comparison of CTC transcriptomic profiles at progression with baseline, we identified an inflammatory response signature in CTCs which was significantly associated with acquired ARSi resistance. Transcriptomic PBMC analysis further identified enrichment of inflammasome gene signatures at progression, with concurrent downregulation of CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T and NK cells.<br \/>Furthermore, preliminary data from both clinical trials, showed a significant upregulation of TGF-&#946;1 and corresponding TGF&#946;-Receptor signaling pathway in CTCs from patients at progression following taxane treatment, suggesting a role for TGF&#946; pathway in clinical response to taxane chemotherapy.<br \/>Taken together, these data demonstrate that liquid biopsy transcriptomics of both tumor cells and immune cells can identify molecular pathways associated with treatment resistance paving the way for treatment optimization and the development of novel precision therapies in patients with mCRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,Transcriptome profiling,Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiaren Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bob Zimmermann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuseppe Galletti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Halabi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ada Gjyrezi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santosh Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akanksha Verma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Sboner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monika Anand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel J.
