[{"Abstract":"Considerable lesion-specific response heterogeneity exists in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, largely due to organ-specific ecological environments and evolutionary pressures. Metastatic lesions with poor response to therapy often become tumor sanctuary sites, leading to systemic resistance and tumor relapse. To map the lesion-specific response and relapse patterns, we investigated the longitudinal dynamics of individual lesions in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Tumor longitudinal data in 4,308 colorectal cancer patients with 40,612 individual lesions were collected from eight Phase III trials in Project Data Sphere. First, tumor response dynamics (regression after treatment and progression upon resistance) were characterized using an empirical mathematical model. Next, tumor response time (when the lesion size decreases &#8805;20% from baseline) and relapse time (when the lesion size increases &#8805;30% from tumor nadir) were estimated for each individual lesion in patients being treated with bevacizumab, panitumumab, and\/or chemotherapy. Random effect cox proportional models were applied to predict lesion-specific response and relapse probabilities and temporal sequence. We then took machine learning algorithm k-means to cluster patients based on their lesion relapse sequence. We found the response probabilities across organs are: Liver &#62; Distal Lymph Nodes (LN) &#62; Abdomen &#62; Spleen &#62; Lung &#62; Regional LN &#62; Adrenal &#62; Muscle\/Soft Tissue &#62; Bone &#62; Brain\/CNS. Lesion relapse temporal sequence are: Brain\/CNS &#62; Liver &#62; Adrenal &#62; Muscle\/Soft tissue &#62; Abdomen &#62; Bone &#62; Spleen &#62; Lung &#62; Distal LN &#62; Regional LN. Of note, lesions in the bone, brain, adrenal, and muscle\/soft tissues often had low responses and high relapse probabilities, implying the greatest potential as tumor sanctuary sites. Liver, the most common metastatic organ in colorectal cancer, showed highest response rate but high relapse probabilities. Interestingly, the organ-specific response rate and relapse probabilities are respectively in line with drug distribution profiles and organ-specific immune landscape. Organ-specific relapse sequence in each patient is significantly correlated with patient long-term survival (p&#60;0.0001). Patients with relapse lesions occurring in multiple organs had worst survival. Patients whose liver lesions relapsed first had worse survival than those who first relapsed in other organs. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the lesion-specific response and relapse heterogeneity in metastatic colorectal cancer, and yields substantial implications for designing lesion-specific therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fe3a9ba8-9718-449a-8816-95a7e3b44de5\/@v03B8ZMW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,sanctuary organ,relapse pattern,colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14120"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiawei Zhou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quefeng Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amber Cipriani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanguang Cao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our aim was to study the effects of drugs used in the treatment of HGSOC - carboplatin (C), paclitaxel (P) and olaparib (O) - on clonal dynamics in experimental models.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> We tracked clonal evolution in PEO1, a <i>BRCA2<\/i>-mutant HGSOC cell line model, by transfecting an initial population of 1.714x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells with a barcode (BC) library (CloneTrackerXP). Barcoded populations of cells (18.73x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/flask) were grown in HYPERflasks till confluence, and then replicates were exposed to C (3163 nM) for 5 weeks, P (6.32 nM) for 4 weeks, and O (28467 nM) for 5 weeks (as single agents), reducing the cell population to &#60; 10% (controls kept till cell confluence in the absence of drugs). After that, drug pressure was removed, allowing cells to regrow fully. NGS was used to quantify BCs in the final cell populations and, to get information on the temporal dynamics, also in dead floating cells collected from the weekly culture media change. Heterogeneity of the cell populations was estimated using the Shannon diversity index (SDI).<br \/><b>Results<\/b> The SDI in the controls was 6.306 (95% Bootstrap CI 6.304-6.310) for C and 6.192 (95% Bootstrap CI 6.190-6.197) for P and O. After exposure to C, P and O, the SDI was reduced to 3.208, 2.520 and 4.753 (95% Bootstrap CI 3.209-3.211, 2.517-2.523, 4.750-4.759) respectively, using aggregated replicates (pairwise 2-sided Hutcheson t-test: p &#60; 2.2e-16 pre-drug exposure vs C, P and O). The number of unique BCs in controls vs C, P and O were 1799 vs 545, 1463 vs 288 and 1463 vs 1270, respectively, demonstrating reduction of heterogeneity and change in frequency of clones following drug selection pressure. Cell populations exposed to C and O share some similar clone selection (approximately 60%). This is important as, although the degree of heterogeneity caused by individual drugs are different (C and P lead to less heterogeneous populations than O), there is some concordance between the remaining clones determined by DNA damaging\/DNA damage response inhibitors compared to clone selection following exposure to antimicrotubule agents. The selection pattern of BCs among replicates of the different drugs was similar with conservation of BCs with the highest fitness, demonstrating that the initial conditions are determinants of selection under drug exposure.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> Our work, for the first time, quantifies and shows that heterogeneity followed by O therapy is greater than by C and P. Furthermore, the emergent population of cells post-selection pressure was more similar in the C and O groups when compared to P-exposed cells, suggesting correlation in the mechanism of action of drugs and drug resistance\/tolerance. Our results also indicate that evolutionary dynamics are largely deterministic and, therefore, can be predictable.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a057bfa1-e911-4878-a504-a52010069b30\/@v03B8ZMW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Tumor evolution,Heterogeneity,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14145"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alvaro H.

Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is the most lethal form and has complex and heterogeneous genomic patterns. Despite the recent development of life-prolonging therapies, mCRPC remains incurable since most patients develop resistance over time. A better understanding of the evolution of resistance to therapy in mCRPC is urgently needed. A major logistical challenge is that collecting serial tissue biopsies from the prostate and metastatic sites such as bone is not feasible. To overcome this issue, we developed a minimally invasive liquid biopsy approach to study the genomic basis of resistance through circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from longitudinally collected plasma samples. To best account for interpatient tumor heterogeneity and treatment history, we selected 60 mCRPC patients who were serially treated with life-prolonging second generation androgen signaling inhibitors (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or the combination) and taxane-based chemotherapy, and prospectively collected longitudinal blood samples (2 to 10 per patient). ctDNA was isolated from each blood plasma sample for sparse whole-genome sequencing and exome sequencing at 200x coverage depth. Somatic copy number alterations (CNA) and exome mutations were profiled and the resulting data was used to reconstruct the clonal substructure and infer clonal evolutionary dynamics across the treatment timepoints. The mutation signatures and the CNA signatures were also characterized. One of the CNA signatures identified the patients who carry <i>CDK12<\/i> mutations through genome-wide focal tandem duplications in ctDNA. The subclones resistant to second-generation androgen signaling inhibitors and taxane-based chemotherapy were also identified, along with their associated genomic aberrations affecting <i>AR<\/i>, <i>RB1<\/i>, and <i>PTEN<\/i>. Furthermore, by analyzing the evolutionary dynamics patterns, we identified three distinct genomic responses to therapy: intrinsic resistance, clonal progression, and clonal responders, which correlated with overall survival outcomes. In summary, our data show that clonal evolutionary dynamics in mCRPC can be tracked over time and in response to treatment with minimally invasive liquid biopsy methods. Our results provide insights into the genomic evolution of life-prolonging therapy resistance in mCRPC and identified candidate resistance biomarkers for subsequent validation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82df5cd1-c203-48e7-af9c-d3847ff6a3dc\/@v03B8ZMW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Clonal evolution,Liquid biopsies,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14146"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuehui Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naveen Ramesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emi Sei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shanshan Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Troncoso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Corn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Aparicio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher J.

To gain insight into the lethal process of metastasis, we report on the longitudinal evolutionary analysis of the TRACERx 421 paired primary-metastasis cohort.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 712 tumor samples, of which 485 were primary tumor and 227 were metastatic samples, from 129 metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with detailed clinical annotation were collected from 18 UK hospital sites and whole exome sequenced. Mutations and copy number events were integrated to resolve the evolutionary history of each tumor.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We observe that metastases generally diverge relatively late in molecular time, after the majority of mutations in the primary tumor have accumulated, with a substantial minority (33%) diverging prior to the last clonal sweep in the primary tumor. For this minority of cases, divergence is estimated to have occurred at tumor volumes below the limit of computed tomography (CT) detection. Our extensively sampled cohort reveals that sampling bias may result in erroneous inference of metastatic trajectories. 79% of metastases diverging after the last clonal sweep in the primary tumor would be misclassified as diverging prior to the last clonal sweep if only a single region of the primary tumor is considered.<br \/>Patterns of dissemination range from monoclonal, involving a single metastatic clone (68% - where metastatic potential is likely acquired once in the life-history of the tumor), to polyclonal and polyphyletic (17%), where metastatic potential may have arisen multiple times during lung cancer development, or at a single time point early in the development of the tumor. We find that thoracic lymph node disease resected at surgery was responsible for less than 20% of subsequent disease dissemination, suggesting that lymph nodes likely represent a hallmark of metastatic potential rather than a gateway to further metastases.<br \/>Furthermore, we observe that clones which seed the metastases are generally dominant within the primary, reflecting positive selection and acquisition of subclonal mutations in specific cancer genes (e.g. RB1, PIK3CA). In squamous cell carcinomas, we find that non-metastatic primary tumors show no significant evidence of positive subclonal selection. We find that 35% of metastases harbor driver mutations not identified in the primary tumor and identify somatic copy number alterations that are enriched in metastases (e.g. CCND1 gains in lung adenocarcinoma).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These data highlight the potential to apply evolutionary measures to primary tumors to predict metastatic risk, the limitations to current screening approaches particularly for early tumor divergence, and the importance of future precision adjuvant therapies to target disseminated micro-metastatic clones.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68e03598-f85c-43ba-a605-d1571f9dd4d4\/@v03B8ZMW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Tumor evolution,Metastasis,Intratumoral heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14147"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ariana Huebner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maise Al Bakir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Martinez Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristiana Grigoriadis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas B.

Traditional lineage tracing approaches have been widely employed to study the metastatic progression of BC. However, these approaches were limited to the investigation of clonal dynamics and did not provide detailed molecular information underlying the pro-metastatic phenotype. In this work, we exploited a library of degenerated barcodes which were both integrated in the genome and expressed as synthetic transcripts. Coupling this barcoding strategy to scRNA-seq analysis, we tracked the clonal and transcriptional evolution of more than 37,000 MDA-MB-231 (a human triple-negative BC cell line) cells in vivo<\/i>. Clonal distribution analysis revealed that BC clones display proliferative heterogeneity in primary tumors, with a small fraction of clones outcompeting all the others. Furthermore, primary breast tumors turned out to be composed of two phenotypically distinct groups of clones: highly proliferative, on one side, and migratory\/stressed\/stem-like, on the other. Then, we showed that the striking majority of metastatic cells derived from a single clone which was under-represented in its primary tumor. Importantly, these pro-metastatic clones upregulated genes and pathways associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction, migration, and type-I interferon (IFN) response. In this scenario, independent pro-metastatic clones heterogeneously upregulated these pathways, thus suggesting a multi-faceted functional phenotype. Despite this variability, we detected a set of genes whose expression was statistically associated with the pro-metastatic phenotype, and we validated the relevance of these molecular features both at the biological and clinical level. First, we observed a reduced metastatic burden upon the in vivo<\/i> knock-down of genes involved in ECM interaction (e.g., ANGPTL4, KCNQ1OT1, and ITGB4) and type-I IFN response (e.g., LY6E and IFI6). Second, we derived two compact gene signatures showing robust predictive power of BC patient survival, independently of other known clinical factors. In conclusion, our work revealed previously unappreciated cellular mechanisms of BC metastasization, providing new actionable therapeutic targets and new molecular predictors of BC prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e6f3d1d-f38e-4cab-94a1-b19e41cccb6f\/@v03B8ZMW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Clonal evolution,Single cell,Transcription,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14148"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Niccolò Roda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Cossa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Ruscitto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Priami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giada Blandano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Dalmasso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Bertolini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pier Giuseppe Pelicci<\/i><\/presenter>.

It has been revealed that the metastatic ability and resistance to chemotherapy might be due to the presence of a subset of cells within the intra-tumorally heterogeneous population. However, tracking the rare genetic subpopulations that play a critical role in cancer recurrence, metastasis and resistance and the lack of a defined in vivo model to recapitulate clonal evolution has been a challenge.<br \/>To further understand clonal dynamics and intra-tumoral heterogeneity a new barcoded PDX (OS17) derived cell line was established by stably transducing the cell line with a lentiviral vector-based system. The highly complex barcode library of ten million enabled labelling each of the cells with a unique molecular identifier and clonally tracking more than one million cells in vitro. Following seventeen passages in vitro and transplant for three generations in vivo, flow cytometry, nested PCR and next generation sequencing showed that the barcoded cells retained the sequence in vitro and in vivo suggesting that it was possible to track cell populations and their clonal lineages both at the genomic DNA and RNA level.<br \/>The barcoded M17 PDX cells were injected in 25 SCID and NSG mice intratibially to monitor tumor growth and clonally track the cells in both the primary tumors and the lungs. Seventeen (68%) of the mice developed primary tumors. Tumor latency and growth was 61.82 &#177;34.5 and 51.24 &#177; 23 days respectively. Seven (35%) of the primary tumor bearing mice had lung metastasis. Limb amputations were performed in 5 mice with 2 surviving the surgery.<br \/>The results not only show a diversity in clonal subpopulations between the mice injected on different dates but also the primary tumor and matched lung metastatic samples. An in-depth clonal characterization further revealed a high degree of similarity in the subclonal populations between the lung nodules and the primary tumor samples. In vitro, a proportion of the barcodes were very reduced or lost in the early six passages however, these slowly expanded in the late passages suggesting that in a more favorable environment in vivo, these clones can maintain tumorigenic potential.<br \/>These results suggest a clonal evolutionary dynamic model where pre-existing clones have a fitness for persistence and dissemination. This advantage might include long term tumorigenic and proliferative potential and the ability to grow in different micro-environments. Conclusion: It has been demonstrated that the barcoded PDX models have inter and intra-tumoral heterogeneity of osteosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo and can potentially be used in tracking tumor colonization at the primary and metastatic sites. Using this model will therefore advance our understanding of osteosarcoma lung metastasis which is the critical clinical challenge for these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9cde7199-2e2d-45be-9b0e-bbe4790ba207\/@w03B8ZMX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Clonal evolution, Lung metastasis,Severe combined immunodeficiency disease-SCID,Next-generation sequencing, NOD-SCID gamma-NSG,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14149"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sylvester Jusu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sankaranarayanan Kannan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sahil Seth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael D.

Its understanding may facilitate the design of anticipation-based management strategies. Richter transformation (RT) is a paradigmatic tumor evolution in which chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an indolent neoplasia of mature B-cells, transforms into a high-grade lymphoma, usually diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), conferring a dismal prognosis. The evolutionary trajectories of RT and its driving (epi)genomic mechanisms remain largely unknown.<br \/><i>Aims: <\/i>To reconstruct the evolutionary history of RT and to reveal the molecular processes underlying this transformation.<br \/><i>Methods<\/i>: We characterized the whole genome (WGS), epigenome (DNA methylation, H3K27ac, ATAC-seq), and transcriptome (RNA-seq), combined with single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing analyses, of 19 CLL patients developing RT before (n=3) or after treatment with chemoimmunotherapy (n=6) and targeted therapies (BCR or BCL2 inhibitors, n=10). We analyzed 54 longitudinal samples covering up to 19 years of disease course.<br \/><i>Results: <\/i>Our WGS analyses uncovered that RT is characterized by a remarkable structural complexity. We also identified a novel treatment-independent RT-specific mutational process, which we named SBS-RT. The genetic driver landscape of RT is a compendium of alterations in genes involved in cell cycle, MYC, and NF-&#954;B pathways, frequently targeted in single catastrophic events including chromothripsis and chromoplexy. The WGS-based phylogenic reconstruction and single-cell DNA\/RNA-seq analyses identified a very early diversification of CLL leading to emergence of RT-cells carrying specific genetic drivers and transcriptomic profiles of RT already at CLL diagnosis. These small subclones were dormant for 6-19 years until rapid expansion associated with the clinical transformation. While the DNA methylome kept track of the cell of origin and proliferative history of RT cells, their chromatin configuration and transcriptional program converged into the overexpression of cell cycle regulators, Toll-like receptors, MYC, MTORC1, and OXPHOS related transcripts, as well as downregulation of BCR pathway. This phenotypic shift was related to <i>de novo<\/i> activation of key transcription factors. In vitro experiments confirmed that RT cells have a 4-fold higher oxygen consumption at routine respiration and electron transfer system capacity compared to CLL. The resistance of RT to BCR inhibition is consistent with its high OXPHOS and low BCR signaling, which mimics <i>de novo<\/i> DLBCL-OXPHOS insensitive to BCR inhibition. This OXPHOS<sup>high<\/sup>-BCR<sup>low<\/sup> transcriptional axis of RT can be exploited therapeutically.<br \/><i>Conclusions: <\/i>These findings demonstrate the early seeding of subclones driving advanced stages of cancer evolution and uncover therapeutic targets for the, once expanded, lethal Richter transformation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e29a1cb5-c922-422c-b12f-3290249e8c2d\/@w03B8ZMX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Clonal evolution,Tumor heterogeneity,Cancer genomics,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14150"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ferran Nadeu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Romina Royo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramon Massoni-Badosa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Garcia-Torre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martí Duran-Ferrer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin J.

We used PET imaging combined with deep sequencing of glioblastoma biopsies at both the RNA and DNA levels to get a deeper insight into molecular evolution. In the clinical setting, PET imaging provides information about metabolically active tumor areas, but the molecular interpretation is unclear. Our primary objective was to perform an intratumoral spatial comparison of biopsies from potentially aggressive and less aggressive areas in glioblastomas according to PET scans. We used MRI co-registered with <sup>11<\/sup>C-MET-PET (amino acid) and <sup>18<\/sup>F-FDG PET (glucose) in order to obtain representative neurosurgical stereotactic biopsies from tumor areas with high accumulation of these two metabolites (hotspot), low accumulation (coldspot), and no accumulation as the periphery of six glioblastoma patients that were processed for whole genome, exome, and transcriptome sequencing. Differential gene expression and gene ontology analysis showed that hotspots were enriched in gene sets associated with DNA replication, cell cycle, and ligand-receptor interaction. Genome and exome analysis suggested hotspots and coldspots have similar mutational profiles. However, a limited number of hotspot-specific mutations and novel fusion transcripts indicated that hotspot-associated tumor cells developed from coldspot-associated tumor cells and point at the potential role of hotspot driver genes in glioblastoma evolution. Our findings reveal that hotspots in glioblastomas represent a more advanced stage of molecular evolution than coldspots.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/090e7864-4f1a-4fff-9fa9-8b9a32c952c9\/@w03B8ZMX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Mutations,Tumor evolution,Angiogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14151"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Atul Anand<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeanette Krogh Petersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Burton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Jakob Larsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Van Brakel Andersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dylan Scott Lykke Harwood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Bonde Pedersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frantz Rom Poulsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Grupe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Torben A.

As TPM-mediated reactivation of telomerase is tumor specific, TPM- tumor cells could be selectively targeted to reverse tumor cell immortalization, especially if this mutation is present throughout the tumor. Previous studies on the clonality of TPM present conflicting results and have relied on minimal tumor sampling. In this study, we use a 3D maximal tumor sampling approach to address this critical issue. We investigated TPM clonality in 253 primary and recurrent tumor samples, from 19 <i>IDH<\/i>-wildtype GBMs and 9 <i>IDH<\/i>-mutant ODs. An average of nine regions per tumor were intraoperatively biopsied in a manner that maximally represents tumor geography. The 3D location of each biopsy was then recorded and mapped back to the patient&#8217;s pre- and post-operative MRI, allowing 3D characterization of each tumor. For initial screening of TPM, PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed on all 253 samples. Deep amplicon sequencing (Amp-seq) was performed on 179 of these samples, including all those in which TPM was not detectable by Sanger. Each Amp-seq reaction included a TPM amplicon and an amplicon with <i>IDH1 <\/i>mutation for ODs or an amplicon spanning a chromosome 10 SNP to evaluate chromosome 10 loss in GBMs, which are early clonal events for these tumor types. Tumor purity, estimated by the FACETS algorithm applied to whole exome sequencing, was available for all 253 tumor samples and their patient-matched blood cell DNA. TERT expression was measured by RNA-seq (144 samples) and RNA Scope (49 samples). Correlations between TPM and clonal alterations and TPM and TERT expression were analyzed for significance. Of 253 tumor samples, tumor purity could be estimated for 210 (83.0%), and of these, 100% had TPM detected by Sanger and Amp-seq. For samples whose tumor purity could not be estimated (assigned a value of NA by FACETS), TPM was still detected in 36 of 43 (83.7%) samples. Variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of TPM showed high positive correlation with those of clonal alterations in GBMs (<i>R<\/i> = 0.85, p &#60; 0.0001) and ODs (<i>R<\/i> = 0.86, p &#60; 0.0001) as well as with tumor purity in both GBMs (<i>R<\/i> = 0.91, p &#60; 0.0001) and ODs (<i>R<\/i> = 0.89, p &#60; 0.0001). TPM VAF showed moderate positive correlation with TERT expression in GBMs (<i>R<\/i> = 0.52, p &#60; 0.0001) and ODs (<i>R<\/i> = 0.62, p &#60; 0.0001). TPM also showed a nonlinear relationship with TERT expression only in ODs. RNA Scope detected TERT expression in a subset of cells in both GBMs and ODs. To conclude, TPM is a tumor-wide, clonal mutation in primary and recurrent GBMs and ODs, making TPM tumor cells a possible therapeutic target. TPM VAF is moderately correlated with TERT expression, with a nonlinear relationship seen in ODs, suggesting other variables affect TERT expression. RNA Scope detected TERT expression at the single cell level in situ in GBMs and ODs and therefore could serve as a tumor cell-specific marker, although follow up studies are needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0de48e63-809b-4bdd-a1f8-cab7cd0a8491\/@w03B8ZMX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TERT,Glioblastoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14152"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christina Leann Appin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abigail K.
