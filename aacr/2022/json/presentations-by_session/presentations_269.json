Since cytokines are central in extensive biological networks to regulate inflammation, it is of great importance to investigate inflammatory cytokines and CRC survival. Among an NCI-sponsored adjuvant chemotherapy trial for patients with stage III colon cancer conducted between 2010 and 2015 (CALGB\/SWOG 80702), we collected serum samples from 1,498 participants at a median of 1.6 months (interquartile [IQR]: 1.3-1.9 months) after surgery. IL-6, TNFR2, and hsCRP were assayed as biomarkers of chronic inflammation and were categorized into quintiles. The primary outcome was disease-free survival, defined as time from randomization to recurrence or death from any cause. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and time to recurrence. We estimated the associations of inflammatory biomarkers with survival using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Of 1,498 participants (median follow-up: 5.9 years), mean age was 61.3 years, 82.2% were White, 55.5% were male, and 387 experienced recurrence or death. Medians (IQRs) of biomarkers were 2.6mg\/L (1.2-5.6mg\/L) for IL-6, 2.9&#215;10<sup>3<\/sup>pg\/mL (2.3-3.6&#215;10<sup>3<\/sup>pg\/mL) for TNFR2, and 2.6mg\/L (1.2-5.6mg\/L) for hsCRP. Compared to the lowest quintile (Q1), the highest quintile (Q5) in inflammatory biomarkers was significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (hazard ratios were 1.52 [95% CI, 1.08-2.15] for IL-6, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.22-2.54] for TNFR2, and 1.66 [95% CI, 1.17-2.35] for hsCRP). Similar patterns were observed for overall survival and time to recurrence. Our findings suggest that higher levels of inflammation after diagnosis were significantly associated with worse survival among those with stage III colon cancer, and reducing inflammation may be considered as a potential intervention to improve CRC survival.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{A3C79E41-D7FC-45D4-AA16-1369961B8905}\"><caption>Associations

Genotyping was conducted using the Illumina OmniExpress or Global Screening Array and imputed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and <i>P<\/i> value for each common variant (minor allele frequency [MAF]&#62;5%) for OS and EFS while adjusting for age at diagnosis, tumor stage, histological subtype, and the top five principal components. Analyses were also conducted by histological subtype: embryonal RMS (ERMS, n=544) and alveolar RMS (ARMS, n=268). Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of the results from the discovery and replication cohorts to generate a summary aHR and <i>P <\/i>value for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified an intergenic SNP at chr8q21.13 associated with worse RMS EFS across subtypes (aHR=2.08, <i>P<\/i>=2.80x10<sup>-9<\/sup>), which had consistent effects across the discovery (aHR=1.91, <i>P<\/i>=5.05x10<sup>-6<\/sup>) and replication (aHR=2.62, <i>P<\/i>=7.16x10<sup>-5<\/sup>) cohorts. This SNP lies in a region which spans the genomic binding site for GATA2 and GATA3, transcription factors that are recognized to contribute to cancer development. We also identified a significant association between a SNP at chr12q21.1 and worse EFS (aHR=2.04, <i>P<\/i>=3.35x10<sup>-8<\/sup>) with consistent effects across the discovery and replication cohorts. Based on data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx), this SNP is associated with expression of <i>SLCO1B1<\/i>, a gene which encodes a liver anion transporter linked to RMS treatment-related toxicities. In subtype-specific analyses, we identified a SNP at chr17q21.32 that was significantly associated with worse ARMS OS (129 events; aHR=3.18, <i>P<\/i>=3.12x10<sup>-8<\/sup>; discovery: aHR=3.19, <i>P<\/i>=6.23x10<sup>-4<\/sup>; replication: aHR=3.16, <i>P<\/i>=1.43x10<sup>-3<\/sup>). In GTEx, this SNP is associated with expression and splicing of genes including <i>PITPNM3<\/i>, <i>KIAA0753<\/i>, and <i>MED31 <\/i>across various tissues. No SNPs were significantly associated with ERMS OS or EFS.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In the first GWAS of RMS survival outcomes, we identified two SNPs that were significantly associated with worse EFS across RMS subtypes. Further, we identified a SNP that was associated with OS in ARMS patients, a subtype that is associated with worse outcomes. Additional investigation of the impact of these SNPs may further support their consideration for novel risk stratification protocols.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Rhabdomyosarcoma,Survival,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bailey A.

As we cannot distinguish reliably progressive from harmless DCIS yet, almost all women with DCIS are treated extensively with surgery and often adjuvant radiotherapy or endocrine treatment, implying overtreatment of many thousands of women with harmless DCIS. PRECISION aims to reduce such overtreatment by identifying factors associated with subsequent ipsilateral IBC. Many factors have been implicated in subsequent DCIS and IBC risk, but most studies relied on small series with limited prognostic power. To overcome this, we conducted pooled analyses of four large cohorts with DCIS from three different countries.<br \/>Methods: Cohorts were pooled with data of 48,804 women with DCIS: a population-based cohort (NL, n=18,996), prospective, a population-based, screening cohort (Sloane, UK, n=8,462), a single center cohort (MDACC, USA, n=2,363), and a representative DCIS patient series from the National Cancer Database Special Study (USA, n=18,983). Patients with missing data on treatment and follow-up or follow-up shorter than six months were excluded from analyses. Risk of a subsequent ipsilateral invasive breast cancer (iIBC) was assessed in three DCIS lesion size groups (&#60;20mm, 20-50mm and &#8805;50mm) and in patients who had clear surgical margins (&#60;2mm) after final breast conserving surgery (BCS) versus patients who did not. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess differences in risk of IBC, with a focus on DCIS size and margin status.<br \/>Results: In final analyses, 48,576 patients, diagnosed between 1999 and 2017, were included. Median follow-up was 7.6 years (range 0.5-21.1). In multivariable analyses, patients with smaller size of DCIS (&#60;20mm) had a decreased risk of iIBC compared with women with larger lesion size (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.68-0.97). In 33,091 BCS treated patients, patients with clear surgical margins had a decreased risk of iIBC (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.52-0.90).<br \/>Conclusion: In our quest to reduce overtreatment for women with DCIS, we have identified free surgical margins and smaller lesion size as independent factors reducing the risk of subsequent ipsilateral invasive breast cancer, irrespective of the treatment received. Knowledge of these, and additional, factors could aid in selecting patients suitable for less invasive management strategies such as active surveillance or omitting radiotherapy. <i>This work was supported by Cancer Research UK and by KWF Dutch Cancer Society (ref.C38317\/A24043); Web site: https:\/\/cancergrandchallenges.org\/teams\/precision<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-22 Statistical and epidemiological methodology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DCIS,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Renee S.

We conducted a large case-only exome sequencing study to further understand the role of rare coding variation in aggressive prostate cancer in a study of 9,185 aggressive (prostate cancer death, metastatic disease, T4, or both T3 and Gleason&#8805;8) and 8,361 non-aggressive cases (T1\/T2 and Gleason&#8804;6) of European ancestry from 19 international studies. Stage 1 samples (N=5,545) had whole exome-sequencing, and stage 2 samples (N=12,001) had targeted exome sequencing for 1,459 genes selected based on stage 1 results and previous evidence. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate gene-based tests and the aggregate effect of multiple genes to investigate whether carrying pathogenic\/likely pathogenic\/deleterious (P\/LP\/D) variants (18,759 identified) was associated with risk of aggressive prostate cancer, prostate cancer death (N=6,033), or metastatic disease (N=1,730) compared to non-aggressive disease. Gene-based tests were meta-analyzed across stages 1 and 2. <i>BRCA2<\/i>, <i>ATM<\/i>, and <i>NBN<\/i> had the most statistically significant gene-based results: <i>BRCA2<\/i> P\/LP\/D variant carriers had 4.3-fold higher odds of aggressive disease (95% CI=3.15-5.86, P=4x10<sup>-20<\/sup>), 4.7-fold higher odds of prostate cancer death (95% CI=3.41-6.59, P=2x10<sup>-20<\/sup>), and 5.7-fold higher odds of metastatic disease (95% CI=3.71-8.76, P=2x10<sup>-15<\/sup>); <i>ATM<\/i> P\/LP\/D variant carriers had 2.2-fold higher odds of aggressive disease (95% CI=1.58-2.99, P=2x10<sup>-6<\/sup>), 2.2-fold higher odds of prostate cancer death (95% CI=1.52-3.05, P=2x10<sup>-5<\/sup>), and 3.0-fold higher odds of metastatic disease (95% CI=1.93-4.61, P=9x10<sup>-7<\/sup>); and <i>NBN<\/i> P\/LP\/D variant carriers had 5.9-fold higher odds of metastatic disease (95% CI=2.56-13.84, P=3x10<sup>-5<\/sup>). Among potentially novel genes with strong but not exome-wide significant statistical evidence were <i>MMP19<\/i>, involved in reproduction and metastasis, with carriers having 2.8-fold higher odds of prostate cancer death (95% CI=1.53-5.05, P=8x10<sup>-4<\/sup>); <i>PKD2L2<\/i>, involved in fertility, with carriers having 3.5-fold higher odds of prostate cancer death (95% CI=1.76-7.04, P=5x10<sup>-4<\/sup>); and <i>SMPD1<\/i>, involved in converting sphingomyelin to ceramide, with carriers having 5.3-fold higher odds of metastatic disease (95% CI=1.85-14.98, P=0.002). At least one P\/LP\/D variant within a subset of 24 previously curated candidate prostate cancer DNA repair genes was carried by 12.8% of aggressive cases (OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.34-1.64, P=3x10<sup>-14<\/sup>), 12.6% of cases who died due to prostate cancer (OR=1.47, 95% CI=1.31-1.65, P=3x10<sup>-11<\/sup>), and 15.1% of metastatic cases (OR=2.16, 95% CI=1.57-2.16, P=5x10<sup>-14<\/sup>) compared to 9.4% of non-aggressive cases. These findings support the importance of rare genetic variation in aggressive prostate cancer risk and may have important implications for prostate cancer risk stratification and screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-14 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exome sequencing,Prostate cancer,Prevention,Risk factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Burcu F.
