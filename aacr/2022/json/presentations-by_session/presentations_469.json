[{"Abstract":"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children with no improvements in treatment options for RMS patients over the past four decades. Therefore, it is critical to understand the fundamental processes underlying RMS tumorigenesis. RMS is divided into two major histologic subtypes - alveolar and embryonal RMS. Nearly all alveolar RMS express oncogenic fusions of PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 whereas embryonal RMS are not driven by these fusion proteins. Instead, embryonal or fusion-negative (FN-RMS) are molecularly heterogeneous. Approximately one-third of fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) patients have copy number loss of <i>PTEN<\/i> (phosphatase and tensin homolog), and approximately 90% of tumors are hypermethylated at the <i>PTEN<\/i> promoter leading to decreased PTEN expression. This indicates a near universal role for <i>PTEN <\/i>loss in FN-RMS, but the functional role of PTEN is still unclear. To determine PTEN&#8217;s function in FN-RMS, we bred <i>Pten<\/i><sup>flox<\/sup> alleles into our <i>aP2-Cre;Smo<\/i><sup>M2<\/sup> (ASP<sup>WT<\/sup>) FN-RMS mouse model to obtain <i>aP2-Cre;Smo<\/i><sup>M2<\/sup>;<i>Pten<\/i><sup>flox\/flox<\/sup> mice (ASP<sup>cKO<\/sup>). Conditional <i>Pten<\/i> deletion accelerated tumorigenesis and produced a tumor with a less differentiated histological appearance, much like human FN-RMS. Interestingly, in <i>Pten<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup> tumors, we found predominant PTEN immunoreactivity within the nucleus suggesting a role for nuclear PTEN in FN-RMS. Transcriptome analyses revealed robust gene expression changes between the ASP<sup>WT<\/sup> and ASP<sup>cKO <\/sup>tumors. The top overexpressed gene in ASP<sup>cKO<\/sup> tumors was <i>Dbx1<\/i> (<i>Developing brain homeobox 1<\/i>), a homeobox transcription factor with no known cancer function but involved in innate behavioral processes such as breathing. We found FN-RMS patient-derived xenografts are dependent on <i>DBX1<\/i> expression, and that <i>DBX1<\/i> expression is controlled by PAX7 (Paired Box 7). PAX7 is a transcription factor expressed in satellite cells and maintains a de-differentiated state in FN-RMS. PAX7 expression is also increased in our ASP<sup>cKO<\/sup> tumors, and we show that human FN-RMS cells are dependent on PAX7 expression for proliferation. This suggests PTEN loss in FN-RMS engages a new transcriptional program necessary for FN-RMS survival. To determine if <i>Pax7<\/i> loss can rescue the deleterious effects of <i>Pten<\/i> loss in our murine FN-RMS model, we deleted both <i>Pten <\/i>and <i>Pax7<\/i> in our <i>aP2-Cre<\/i>;<i>Smo<sup>M2<\/sup> <\/i>mice (ASP<sup>cKO<\/sup>P7<sup>cKO<\/sup>). ASP<sup>cKO<\/sup>P7<sup>cKO<\/sup> tumor onset kinetics resembled tumors with wild-type PTEN and were negative for skeletal muscle markers MYOD1 and MYOGENIN. However, these tumors were positive for leiomyosarcoma markers smooth muscle actin and CALDESMON. Together, our data suggests PTEN and PAX7 have a synthetic essential relationship in FN-RMS and that PAX7 is a proliferative driver and lineage dependency for FN-RMS tumors. This work also illustrates the power of murine models to unravel the genetic dependencies underlying both tumor maintenance and identity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e72661d-5eb2-4e50-9955-f4dfdcd44576\/@C03B8ZN4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,PTEN,Mouse models,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14850"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Casey G.

Currently, no effective molecular targeted therapies are available for the OS, however, many OS patients possess genetically defined somatic DNA copy number alterations, including amplification of chromosome 8q24, which harbors the oncogene Myc, and correlates with a worse prognosis. To better understand the molecular pathogenesis, and identify targeted therapy for OS, a robust and reliable preclinical model is needed both for the primary and metastatic disease. We have developed a novel conditional, osteoblast-specific Myc knock-in murine model to understand the mechanisms that underlie the ability of Myc to drive the development and progression of OS and utilize it for the identification of Myc-dependent intrinsic and extrinsic molecular vulnerabilities. A tissue-specific Myc-in genetically engineered murine model was generated by crossing Col2.3-Cre; TP53Flox\/+ mice with LSL-MycT58A mice and characterized integrating RNA-seq and Mass Spectrometry. Syngeneic murine OS cell lines were also generated and characterized. The molecular characterization of the GEMM model was compared with high and low Myc expressing human tumors using the OS-TARGET dataset. Differential gene expression in Myc-driven and non-driven-tumor tissue samples were quantified by RNA sequencing. The immune landscape of OS was evaluated using SymphonyFACS and IHC staining. Murine OS tumor type was confirmed by H&#38;E staining. OS tumor was highly aggressive and metastatic in more than 60% of the mice. Myc expression was significantly higher both at the transcriptional and protein levels in the Myc-in tissue\/cells compared to the non-Myc-driven model. Expression of 1479 genes (out of 13781 genes) were significantly altered in which 543 were upregulated and 936 were downregulated at transcriptional levels in Myc-in tumor tissue samples as compared to the low-Myc-driven OS tumor model analyzed by RNA sequencing. Myc-target-genes, splicing factor-related genes, E2F, G2M check-point, and DNA repair associated genes were significantly upregulated whereas the immune-related genes, oxidative phosphorylation, adipogenesis, and E2M transition genes were significantly downregulated when compared between two groups, which correlates to differential gene ontologies noted in high Myc human tumors. The total immune cell population, specifically the myeloid and macrophage populations were significantly diminished in the Myc-in tumor models, which could contribute to the poor prognosis in OS.Our murine model closely resembles human OS and will provide new opportunities for dissecting the molecular pathogenesis, identification of novel therapeutic strategies, and pre-clinical modeling for direct translational applications and targeting of Myc-driven OS.<b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/15098b3c-35a4-480e-a212-28be126a2b58\/@C03B8ZN4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-04 Pediatric cancer tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Tumor microenvironment,Mouse models,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14851"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bikesh K.

It is assumed that a permissive cellular context or potentially additional complementing mutations are necessary for the EWS-FLI1 fusion to exert its full oncogenic effect. Prior efforts to generate genetic EwS mouse models failed because of high EWS-FLI1 induced apoptosis when expressed in various candidate progenitor cell types. In our study, we restricted EWS-FLI1 expression to mesenchymal stem cells during endochondral bone formation by crossing a mouse containing EWS-FLI1 knocked into the Rosa26 locus with a mouse expressing Prx1-driven Cre recombinase. However, the resulting EF<sup>prx1 <\/sup>progeny died after birth as functional consequence of severe skeletal malformations resulting from differentiation arrest of early chondrocytes. In vitro, these embryonic EWS-FLI1 transgenic chondrocyte-like mesenchymal stem cells (EF<sup>prx1<\/sup> MSCLC) are immortal, but not fully transformed. However, we observed elevated levels of cleaved PARP-1, a surrogate marker of apoptosis. This apparent increased cellular turnover was paralleled by down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl2a family genes as identified by RNA-seq analysis of EF<sup>prx1 <\/sup>MSCLC. The peak incidence of human EwS occurs during puberty, a developmental period in which several growth promoting hormones are highly enriched in the bone microenvironment. Among them is IGF1, which is known for its anti-apoptotic activity through upregulation of Bcl2 family genes. As previous studies implied IGF1 signaling essential in EwS pathogenesis, we speculated that IGF1 treatment may aid in the transformation process of EF<sup>prx1<\/sup> MSCLC. In fact, a significant increase in soft-agar colony formation was observed upon IGF1 treatment for 4 weeks. To test whether IGF1 had irreversibly reprogrammed EF<sup>Prx1<\/sup> MSCLC, we picked colonies grown in presence of IGF1, expanded and re-assayed them after 5 weeks in absence of the hormone. Strikingly, EF<sup>prx1<\/sup> MSCLC retained their transformed phenotype not only in the soft-agar assay but also upon xenotransplantation in mice. Gene set enrichment analysis of upregulated genes from these stably hormone-reprogramed fully transformed EF<sup>prx1<\/sup> MSCLC showed a significant enrichment for the EWS-FLI1 specific transcriptional signature and cell cycle-related pathways, while apoptotic gene sets were downregulated. Our data suggest that transient IGF1 exposure in the bone microenvironment may be required for EWS-FLI1 driven transformation. We propose that EwS formation could be influenced by hormonal changes during puberty. Based on these findings, we postulate that correct developmental timing of EWS-FLI1 expression may play a pivotal role for the generation of an EwS mouse model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a6e4b03d-391b-4fa6-89cb-ae4911515dbf\/@C03B8ZN4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,EWS-FLI1,IGF-1,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14852"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rahil Noorizadeh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Halbritter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Sax<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wolfgang Mikulits<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Moriggl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heinrich Kovar<\/i><\/presenter>.

Indeed, DIPGs&#8217; location and infiltrative properties preclude their surgical resection. Moreover, DIPGs poorly respond to chemotherapeutic agents. In this context, the only treatment for these tumors remains palliative radiotherapy, systematically followed by tumor progression. In addition to their resistance to therapies, DIPGs are characterized by recurrent histone H3 mutations. The H3.3K27M mutation is the most frequent and results from a heterozygous single nucleotide variant in the <i>H3F3A<\/i> gene, inducing the lysine 27 substitution by a methionine. Although H3.3K27M&#8217;s driver role in DIPGs tumorigenesis is now established, its role in their chemo- and radioresistance remains unclear. Aiming to decipher the potential role of this mutation in pediatric gliomas&#8217; resistance to therapies, we established isogenic cellular models of H3.3K27M induction and reversion.We first induced H3.3K27M mutation in three initially non-mutated supratentorial pediatric glioma cell lines. Thus, we generated models that stably expressed the dominant-negative H3.3K27M or the wild type H3.3 as controls. Complementarily, to study H3.3K27M roles in a DIPG cell context, we also developed H3.3K27M reversion models in two initially mutated DIPG cell lines by applying a gene-editing strategy based on the combinatorial use of the CRISPR\/Cas9 technology and an insert.We showed that H3.3K27M induction in Res259 and KNS42 cells conferred a radioresistant phenotype to a fractionated radiotherapy schedule. Besides, we performed a screening of 80 anti-cancer drugs, which revealed a differential impact of the mutation on the drug sensitivity profiles of our three H3.3K27M-induced cell lines. These results indicate that H3.3K27M can control pediatric glioma cells&#8217; resistance to therapies, but in a heterogeneous way depending on the cellular context. Along this line, we are currently characterizing the chemo- and radiotherapy response of our new DIPG H3.3K27M-reversed models. Altogether, our first results support a role for H3.3K27M in pediatric gliomas resistance to treatments, and our complementary models pave the way for identifying new H3.3K27M-dependent mechanisms and promising targets to sensitize DIPGs to therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a7fcf8a7-4004-409f-b1a2-e8be0dd4595c\/@C03B8ZN4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Pediatric cancers,Radioresistance,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14854"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andria Rakotomalala<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Lewandowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quentin Bailleul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clara Savary<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mélanie Arcicasa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Bal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maud Hamadou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Huchedé<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Restouin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Remy Castellano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yves Collette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Vincent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre-Olivier Angrand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Adriaenssens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuefen Le Bourhis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre Leblond<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Castets<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eddy Pasquier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Furlan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Meignan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Almost all retinoblastoma tumors are initiated by bi-allelic mutational inactivation of RB1, yet there is a broad range of clinical presentations, suggesting the existence of secondary driver events in cancer progression. Genomic analysis identified BCOR as the second most commonly mutated gene in retinoblastoma. There is growing evidence that inactivating BCOR mutations are associated with more aggressive features, such as dedifferentiation, vitreous seeding, optic nerve invasion, and worse patient outcomes. Unfortunately, little is known about the function of BCOR in the retina and the effects of BCOR loss in retinoblastoma. Here, we used <i>Xenopus laevis<\/i> and <i>tropicalis <\/i>models to study the role of BCOR in normal ocular and retinal development. In both models, targeted depletion of BCOR in cell lineages giving rise to the eye resulted in a discrete microphthalmia phenotype. Furthermore, we developed in situ hybridization tools for probing characteristic retinal lineage-specific genes and performed histology to compare structural differences. We provide evidence that BCOR normally regulates critical steps in retinal developmental, suggesting that loss of BCOR in retinoblastoma may drive tumor progression by disrupting this function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ce6ce9d-2c15-4415-962e-d4f6992a8908\/@C03B8ZN4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Cancer progression,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14855"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michelle Garying Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dawn Owens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Pelaez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>J.

For children who experience relapses of their tumors, usually after very intensive first-line therapy, curative treatment options are scarce. Thus, the need for predictive preclinical platforms explicitly for pediatric brain tumors is an urgent need. In the framework of the ITCC-P4 public-private partnership, we thus far fully established 23 pediatric brain tumor-derived PDX models. A selection of four high grade glioma, one medulloblastoma and one ependymoma models were used to validate a protocol for fluorescence-based optical imaging. Tumor growth characteristics, latency and histopathology were evaluated for the un-transduced and iRFP713-transduced models side by side. In case of iRFP713-transduced PDX models, tumor load was determined twice a week with the Pearl trilogy system (LiCor, Germany). All animals were examined for neurological symptoms daily and body weight was examined twice a week. The latency of the tumor models ranged from 29 days to 180 days. The take rate was 100% across all the models with n=12 NSG mice per setting. The transduction did not influence the take rate, but 30 - 40% more donor material was needed due to viability loss during the overnight transduction. It was not possible to determine the transduction efficiency for iRFP713 in the overnight culture as the signal is getting upregulated only 48h - 72h post transduction, e.g., when the cells are already implanted. The signal was stable for up to 180 days in the slowest tumor model ependymoma HN0579. The fastest model, high grade glioma HG0068, reached termination criteria within 24 days. Histopathological examination was strictly correlated with the tumor load determined by optical imaging in situ and <i>ex vivo <\/i>(organ imaging). The histopathological investigation of the mouse brains displayed no differences in tumor localization, size, and invasiveness between the transduced and the un-transduced lines. The proliferation rate determined by Ki-67 staining was not influenced by the modification of the cells. Further molecular and phenotypic characterization of the transduced vs the un-transduced PDX will increase the utility of this platform for the development of new drugs and the identification of innovative drug targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03640a18-8ded-49cf-8b92-b3294abc978a\/@C03B8ZN4\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Imaging,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14856"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Eva Oswald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kanstantsin Lashuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johannes Gojo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dorothee Lenhard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norman Mack<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonja Krausert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniela Lötsch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcel Kool<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Till Milde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Walter Berger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan M.

Development of faithful Wilms&#8217; tumor cell lines is needed to identify novel therapeutics. Currently, established Wilms&#8217; tumor cell lines that are suitable for high throughput studies only represent anaplastic Wilms, a rare subtype. In contrast, cell lines representing the more common favorable histology Wilms&#8217; tumor (FHWT) often have poor proliferative capacity and are unable to passage long-term (e.g. &#62;20 passages). For this reason, there is a need to establish robust cell lines representing FHWT. We hypothesize that there are core factors missing from the cell culture medium which prevent proper growth signaling and proliferation. We first performed bulk RNA-sequencing from patients and associated cell lines at Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center with an underlying diagnosis of FHWT. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the reduced growth and proliferation in these FHWT cell lines may be due to reduced presence of the mitogenic fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) in the cell culture environment as compared to the tumor environment. Wilms&#8217; tumor has notably high <i>FGF8<\/i> expression levels compared to all other pediatric tumors, implicating FGF8 as a potential driving factor in tumor maintenance. To characterize the phenotypic effects of FGF8 reintroduction in short term FHWT cell lines, we both endogenously overexpressed <i>FGF8<\/i> via a lentiviral vector and ectopically added recombinant FGF8 to the cell culture medium. Qualitatively, endogenous overexpression of <i>FGF8<\/i> induced distinct morphological changes in cells, converting the enlarged and flattened cells into more focal cells resembling proliferative early passage cells. Quantitatively, overexpression of <i>FGF8<\/i> in one favorable histology cell line led to an increased rate of cellular proliferation and extended the cellular longevity by seven passages (47% above baseline). RNA-sequencing analysis of these <i>FGF8<\/i> overexpressing cells implicated the anti-apoptotic gene, <i>NTSR1<\/i>, and an extracellular matrix protein, SNED1, as potential downstream targets of<i> FGF8<\/i> overexpression. However, ectopic addition of recombinant FGF8 protein to the cellular medium had less pronounced effects, with seemingly cell-line specific effects. These data demonstrate FGF8 as possibly being required for survival in certain Wilms&#8217; tumor cell lines that can be modulated to influence <i>in vitro<\/i> proliferation and longevity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6c626e39-6ac9-4b24-a9c4-c5ed41546724\/@C03B8ZN4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wilms' tumor,Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),Pediatric cancers,Cell growth,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14857"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Garrett Cooper<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nate Smyth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karuna Mittal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor Lawrence<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hunter Jonus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenny Shim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Goldsmith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Hong<\/i><\/presenter>.

These resources are often shared or made commercially available to support scientific progress. Given the fast pace of research, it can be difficult to keep track of the large number of available tools. Moreover, for those new to a particular disease area, learning about the array of tools available can be a major impediment. Our experience in the neurofibromatosis field has shown that researchers struggle to identify the research tools available to them, determine where tools can be acquired, and understand what tools are most well-suited for which experiments. While a variety of databases exist to help researchers find useful research tools, these databases often a) are specific to one type of research tool while being disease-agnostic, b) provide only high-level information, c) do not contain information about in-development models, and d) do not contain observational data for the research tools. To address these limitations, we created the Neurofibromatosis Research Tools Database, a user-friendly, open-access database and companion portal designed to help the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) research community easily find, obtain, and use NF1-relevant research tools. This prototype database catalogs a wide variety of NF1-relevant research tools using databases such as Cellosaurus, AntibodyRegistry, RRID Portal, among others, as well as information provided in literature and from the NF community. We aggregated and curated metadata for NF1-relevant animal models, cell lines, genetic reagents, antibodies, and biobanks. The database includes core metadata for all tools, e.g., name, type of tool, synonyms, developer, as well as tool type-specific metadata, e.g., for cell lines or animal models, the type of cancer that the model recapitulates. The database is also designed to store observational data contributed directly from the research community. Our companion web portal allows users to search and filter this database interactively and easily explore these tools. This website was built within the NF Data Portal (nf.synapse.org), and is available at tools.nf.synapse.org. Community members can actively contribute to the growth of the database and portal by submitting information about the reliability, biology, usage, and other observations on each research tool. By collating and curating this information and surfacing it in an open-access exploration portal, we anticipate that this database will serve as a valuable resource to help the NF community discover, understand, and use NF1 research tools.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9e554b5f-085d-4ed2-8c0c-40b0b1134e2e\/@C03B8ZN4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell lines,Databases,Animal models,Biobank,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14858"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Brynn Zalmanek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Goss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mialy DeFelice<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Hodgson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Clayton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stockard Simon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Marasca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie Bletz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James A.

Efforts to identify the mechanisms of medulloblastoma development have focused on mapping the extent of the tumor cell heterogeneity within each subgroup. Nevertheless, little is known about the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in medulloblastoma progression, particularly in subgroups 3-4, which have the worst prognosis due to metastatic disease. In this study, we performed single-cell transcriptomics on 14 human medulloblastoma samples spanning all molecular subgroups, to uncover novel TME-tumor interactions modulating medulloblastoma progression and metastasis. Unsupervised clustering of all medulloblastoma samples revealed 18 subclusters, including tumor granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) in different stages of differentiation, stromal cells (including oligodendrocyte precursors, mature oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and pericytes), myeloid cells (including microglia, monocytes and macrophages) as well as lymphoid cells. To investigate subgroup-specific signatures as well as TME-tumor pathways, we analyzed each subgroup separately. Analysis of supporting stroma cells in groups 3-4 demonstrated the presence of 8 different stroma populations, including a population of tumor-associated endothelial cells. Tumor-associated endothelial and fibroblast populations of groups 3-4 showed the highest expression of genes for vascular remodeling and extracellular matrix degradation, suggesting an active reprogramming of the stroma by tumor GNP cells to support medulloblastoma progression. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like processes that regulate stem cell, invasion and metastatic properties were upregulated in the tumor GNP populations of groups 3-4 compared to SHH and WNT subgroups. Finally, we highlight the presence of the CXCL1-CXCL5\/CXCR2 metastasis-associated axis in groups 3-4 medulloblastomas as a potential therapeutic target. Our findings provide biological insights into TME processes for the different subgroups of medulloblastoma and possible new potential therapeutic avenues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/70cc5b43-7ff5-4b96-832b-fb6efecec515\/@k03B8ZN5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-04 Pediatric cancer tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14861"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ioanna Tsea<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yana Ruchiy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manouk Verhoeven<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Indranil Sinha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Klas Blomgren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lena Maria Carlson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Inge Johnsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cecilia Dyberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ninib Baryawno<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is an embryonal neuroendocrine tumor arising from the neural crest lineage. Amplification of <i>MYCN<\/i> is a frequent genetic abnormality, found in approximately 20% of NB tumors, and represents a critical stratifying prognostic marker. Given that <i>MYCN<\/i> plays a key role in NB tumorigenesis and aggressiveness, the TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model is widely used in NB research. This model is characterized by the overexpression of <i>MYCN<\/i> in neuroectodermal cells, driven by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. This overexpression gives rise to tumors exclusively in the sympathoadrenal system, reflecting human NB features. We aimed to explore the transcriptional landscape of TH-MYCN tumors by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> Tumors from three homozygous and two hemizygous TH-MYCN mice were dissociated into single cells, profiled by scRNA-seq (Chromium 3&#8217; v2 kit, 10x Genomics), sequenced on the NextSeq platform (Illumina). A total of 41666 single cells were analyzed using <i>pagoda2 <\/i>and <i>conos<\/i>. TH-MYCN tumor single-cell transciptomes were further aligned with previously published transcriptomes from the adrenal gland of three mice at embryonic day (E)13.5. To evaluate malignant tumor cells, copy number variants (CNV) were analyzed using <i>inferCNV<\/i>. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate the bioinformatically predicted cell types.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>scRNA-seq of tumors from TH-MYCN mice revealed 16 major cell populations, spanning stromal, immune and tumor compartments. <i>MYCN+<\/i> tumor cells predominantly resemble sympathetic neuroblasts (<i>Isl1<\/i>, <i>Stmn1<\/i>, <i>Nefl<\/i>, <i>Nefm<\/i>), while <i>MYCN<\/i>+ chromaffin-like tumor cells (<i>Pnmt<\/i>, <i>Cdkn1c<\/i>, <i>Th<\/i>, <i>Dbh<\/i>) were rare. Immunofluorescence stainings confirmed that tumors predominantly consist of proliferating sympathetic neuroblasts. Tumor cell nests were surrounded by supportive stromal and immune cells. The adrenergic tumor cell composition observed in TH-MYCN tumors is highly reminiscent of human NB. Interestingly, we discovered a cluster of immature adrenergic tumor cells aligning with normal fetal cells transitioning from bridge to chromaffin state (characterized by <i>Sox11<\/i>, <i>Atrx<\/i>, <i>Xist<\/i>, <i>Ptprs<\/i>, <i>Tcf4<\/i>). Distinct genomic aberrations, particularly unique chromosomal deletions, were found in the immature adrenergic tumor cells relative to their sympathoblast and chromaffin tumor cell counterparts.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Examining the cellular composition of TH-MYCN tumors at a transcriptional level gives a detailed view of tumor cell heterogeneity at an unprecedented resolution. This comprehensive atlas of TH-MYCN tumors provides a resource for unmasking novel therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f5729a0d-99c1-4928-96aa-97da8a59074b\/@k03B8ZN5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transgenic mouse models,Endocrine\/neuroendocrine cancer,Single cell,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14862"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bethel Tesfai Embaie<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adele Alchahin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thale Kristin Olsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirak Sarkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shenglin Mei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ninib Baryawno<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite undoubted expression of key myogenic regulatory factors, RMS cells are blocked in a proliferative state and do not complete terminal differentiation. The extent to which the skeletal muscle lineage is represented in RMS tumors, as well as the mechanisms leading to developmental arrest, remain elusive. We therefore aimed to identify RMS subpopulations, understand why RMS cells are stalled in their differentiation path, and determine mechanisms to pharmacologically restore myogenic differentiation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry analysis, we profiled cells from 14 PDX-derived primary cultures and three cell lines of alveolar (aRMS) and embryonal RMS (eRMS) subtypes. We discovered that both RMS subtypes contain different cell subpopulations distributed along the myogenic lineage. aRMS tumors recapitulate a yet unrecognized branched myogenic trajectory, where progenitor cells either commit to differentiation or give rise to actively cycling myoblasts. Following <i>in vitro<\/i> exposure to chemotherapy, aRMS cells show compositional shifts towards undifferentiated states, consistent with a model where treatment rewires cellular trajectories. To quantify aRMS cellular states, we developed an automated image-based single-cell approach and applied it to identify pro-differentiating agents among a library of &#62;240 FDA-approved drugs. We identified the RAS pathway as an important mediator of myogenic differentiation in several aRMS cultures, demonstrating the potential for differentiation therapy. Current studies are ongoing to validate these results <i>in vivo<\/i> and to uncover drug combinations that completely overcome the differentiation block. Taken together, this study reveals possible cellular origins for RMS and identifies a potential novel treatment strategy for aRMS that targets cellular differentiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d498d513-2295-4aee-9e36-da81c6677566\/@k03B8ZN5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-04 Pediatric cancer tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Differentiation,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Sequencing,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14863"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara G.

Patients who present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis have a dismal prognosis, compared to the &#62;70 % 5-year survival of those with localized disease. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptional landscape of primary ES tumors, and to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood at the time of diagnosis in order to further understand ES transcriptional heterogeneity and factors that drive metastasis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Viably frozen primary tumor and peripheral blood samples were obtained from 7 ES patients at the time of diagnosis and prior to the initiation of treatment. Tumors were dissociated into a single cell suspension and sorted for viability using FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) whereas peripheral blood samples were subjected to a size-based selection with the CellSieve microfiltration system. ScRNA-seq was performed using the 10xChromium platform and count matrices were generated using 10x Genomics Cell Ranger software. Quality control, integration, and cluster analysis was performed with Seurat.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Cluster analysis of integrated, primary tumor samples demonstrated that candidate ES cell clusters express FLI1 and ES marker NKX2-2 and cluster separately from immune cell populations. Additionally, using inferCNV, ES clusters were demonstrated to harbor chromosomal copy number alterations known to be associated with ES and that were previously identified clinically on preliminary pathology reports for each patient; further GSEA analysis showed significant overlap between published ES gene sets and genes upregulated in ES clusters. Further analysis of ES cells demonstrated that cell-cycle phase determined a cluster enriched in pro-proliferation gene signatures, and overall heterogeneity of expression of previously known therapeutic targets. Candidate ES CTCs were identified among the peripheral blood samples among clusters which corresponded with distinct immune cell populations. The candidate ES CTCs expressed NKX2-2 and demonstrated enrichment in oncogenic gene signatures.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> ScRNA-seq of primary ES tumors is feasible and demonstrates that ES tumor cells are largely homogeneous in nature; and candidate ES CTCs can be identified in peripheral blood at the time of diagnosis in ES patient and warrant further investigation as to their utility as a biomarker of metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e88e695c-9f34-43ae-88ba-4a9c69617f7d\/@k03B8ZN5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Single cell,Circulating tumor cells,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14865"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sarah K.
