Screening programs for breast, colon, and cervical cancer as well as the NLST trial for lung cancer screening demonstrated significant improvement in survival rates with screening. However, for 2021, the American Cancer Society estimates these screened cancers represent less than ~40% of cancer incidence and deaths. The remainder of cancer deaths occur because of tumors in unscreened organs and, therefore, a multicancer test that detects cancer in these organs can increase survival rates. By focusing on detection of unscreened cancers, this type of multicancer test would be complementary to current screening procedures. Here we describe the validation of a combined panel of methylated DNA markers (MDMs) and proteins for multicancer detection through testing an independent set of case\/control samples.<br \/><b><u>Experimental Procedures<\/u><\/b><u>:<\/u> In this study, we further evaluate the performance of our previously identified panel of 15 MDMs and 5 proteins for multicancer detection (Allawi et al., 2021 AACR Annual Meeting) by testing 315 controls and 160 cases encompassing 6 cancer types (liver, esophageal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and stomach). All samples used in the study were case-control collections with smoking status, age, and gender matching between cases and asymptomatic controls. Testing was performed in blinded fashion using multiplex PCR followed by LQAS (<u>L<\/u>ong probe <u>Q<\/u>uantitative <u>A<\/u>mplified <u>S<\/u>ignal) assay on bisulfite converted DNA extracted from 3 mL of plasma collected in LB Gard&#174; blood tubes. Protein concentrations were determined from paired serum aliquots and combined with MDMs for a multi-analyte analysis. The subjects were divided into training and validation with equal representation of cancer type, staging, gender, and age. Two thirds of the cases and controls were used to train with a logistic prediction algorithm, and the remaining 1\/3 were used to validate the model.<br \/><b><u>Results<\/u><\/b><u>:<\/u> Using stepwise logistic regression, a training model of MDMs and protein markers resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.97 and cancer sensitivity of 89% at 98% specificity. The same model predicted the validation set with an AUC of 0.96 and cancer sensitivity of 85% at a specificity of 95%. Applying the algorithm to the combined training and validation sets resulted in sensitivities and specificities of 88% and 97%, respectively. The sensitivities per cancer type ranged from 73% for pancreatic cancer to 97% for lung cancer.<br \/><b><u>Conclusion and Next Steps<\/u><\/b><u>:<\/u> This study demonstrates the performance of our MDMs and protein markers and their importance as components in our multi-omics strategy for multicancer detection. The next steps would be to expand the testing to include additional cancer types and combine with NGS-based methods to improve performance and optimize workflow.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-11 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Multiomics,Early detection,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hatim T.

Recent investigations have identified a ketogenic diet (KD) as a nutritional intervention in GBM. KD is a high-fat diet with a low carbohydrate intake. It is postulated that a KD dramatically shifts nutritional bioavailability in both tumors and its microenvironment. Since immune cells also rely upon similar nutrients for performing their functions, we hypothesized that a KD might also influence their anti-tumor activity. Consistent with previous publications, utilizing genetically engineered murine GBM tumor cells orthotopically implanted in immune-competent mice, we demonstrated improved survival in mice fed a KD when compared to mice fed a standard diet (p=0.043<i>).<\/i> To begin to understand the immune consequences of a KD in GBM, we immunophenotyped these tumors. Of the immune cells analyzed, we discovered that KD played an important role in influencing macrophage polarization, which recent investigations suggest play a critical role in inducing a potent immune suppression in GBM. Specifically, anti-tumor activity was observed in mice fed a KD, there was a paradoxical 50% increase in immune suppressive M2 macrophages (CD45<sup>+<\/sup>CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>CD206<sup>+<\/sup>) coupled with a decrease in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (CD45<sup>+<\/sup>CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>CD80<sup>hi<\/sup>). To extend these findings, we recapitulated KD <i>in vitro<\/i> using a modified cell culture media. Consistent with <i>in vivo<\/i> studies, murine macrophages cultured in these conditions skewed polarization towards the M2 phenotype with immune suppressive properties and we went on to mechanistically link these findings to activation of transcription factor PPAR&#947;. Although anti-tumor activity was observed in mice fed a KD, we hypothesized this parallel increase in M2 macrophage polarization tempered its potential therapeutic benefit. Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) plays a central role in macrophage differentiation and CSF-1 receptor inhibition is actively being investigated as a strategy to skew their polarization towards an M1 anti-tumor phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we performed investigations combining KD with the brain penetrant, clinically relevant CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945. Consistent with our hypothesis, this combination demonstrated a striking improvement in survival in comparison to KD or BLZ945 alone (p=0.0004) with 50% of mice achieving long term survival (&#62;50 days). Correlative studies confirmed the capacity of BLZ945 to normalize KD-induced increases in M2s and the combination induced an increase of iNOS+ M1s, which are responsible for performing pro-inflammatory functions in tumors. Collectively, although anti-tumor activity was observed with a KD, parallel increases in M2 macrophage tempered its therapeutic benefit. Combinatorial strategies using agents designed to modulate macrophage polarization represent a rational approach to improve the anti-tumor activity of a KD in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Immunosuppression,Immunomodulation,Diet,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pravin Kesarwani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiva Kant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>C.

To ensure over 25% of participants are of disadvantaged or minority status, we have recruited multiple community hospitals (Jamaica, Flushing, Wyckoff, and Staten Island\/Bronx satellites of Northwell hospitals) to the study in partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Patients included in this study are survivors of non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, status-post definitive treatment (surgery or radiation) with no evidence of disease for at least one year. These patients may be on maintenance therapy for their prior lung cancer but may not have any other active malignancy at the time of enrollment. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to standard surveillance at the discretion of the treating physician or standard surveillance plus six-monthly methylation-based liquid biopsy tests over a two-year study period, and strict guidelines on follow-up of positive liquid biopsy testing will be provided to reduce harms from false positives or overdiagnosis.<br \/>The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of late stage cancer (distant recurrence or new primary cancer of stage III\/IV). Secondary endpoints include incidence of early cancers (locoregional recurrence or new primary cancer of stage I\/II), metastasis-free survival, and utilization of liquid biopsy versus standard of care scans. We will stratify our results by minority and socioeconomic status to specifically ascertain the effect of this intervention on populations of need. This is the first randomized controlled trial of liquid biopsy in a survivor population and the first trial utilizing liquid biopsy in a large minority population.

Every year 1.6 million men are diagnosed with PCa and 366,000 men die of PCa. PCa is associated to various risk factors that include old age, ethnicity, family history, lifestyle, diet, environmental and occupational exposures. Cadmium (Cd), a well-known metal carcinogen is one of the most copious occupational and environmental pollutant found in air, soil, dietary products, and tobacco. Cd is implicated in the carcinogenesis of PCa, but the mechanism remains elusive. To explore new targets for Cd induced PCa, chronic exposure of 10&#181;M of Cd for over a year induced malignant transformation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH1) cells which was used as a cellular model in this study. The Cd transformed BPH1 cells named as BPH-Cd were confirmed for tumorigenic characteristics by performing clonogenic assay, spheroid growth assay and wound healing experiments. BPH-Cd cells were further subjected to genomic analysis to identify signaling networks that are deregulated in the carcinogenesis of Cd. Our data suggested that one of the potential underlying mechanism of Cd carcinogenesis may be due to the upregulation of Wnt-3A and &#946;-catenin pathway. In addition, Cd also activated stemness-related genes such as ALDHA1, NANOG and Oct1. Next, to determine whether targeting Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway in BPH-Cd could disrupt the oncogenic potential of these cells, Clofazimine, a FDA-approved anti-leprosy drug known to inhibit broad range of Wnt-dependent cancers were explored in this study. Cell viability assay indicated the inhibition of cell growth of BPH-Cd cells by Clofazimine in a dose-dependent manner with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 5&#181;M. Furthermore, Clofazimine robustly inhibited the tumorigenesis of BPH-Cd as observed in colony formation assay. Of note, In-vitro 3D spheroid assay suggested that Clofazimine decreased the size of spheroids with increasing doses. Clofazimine also showed cell cycle arrest by flow cytometry in G2\/M phase in BPH-Cd cells. Confocal imaging of Wnt-3A suggested a decrease in the intensity of expression with increasing doses of clofazimine in BPH-Cd treated cells. Western blot analysis of Clofazimine treated BPH-Cd cells showed downregulation of CDK2, increase in cleaved PARP-1 and upregulation of p21. Importantly, Clofazimine also displayed potent anti-cancer effects on hormone driven (androgen-dependent) LNCaP human prostate cancer cells by inhibiting the cell viability, clonogenic ability and inducing G2\/M cell cycle arrest in this cell line. Taken together, our study suggests that Clofazimine could be a potential chemopreventive and anti-prostate cancer agent which warrants further evaluation for its clinical application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-05 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genitourinary cancers: prostate,Cadmium,Wnt signaling,&#946;-catenin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rifika Jain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gnanasekar Munirathinam<\/i><\/presenter>.

MCM induced apoptosis in cancer cells, as indicated by the appearance of a sub-G1 peak and confirmed by Annexin V\/PI assay and histopathological examination. This was mediated by increased Bax expression, caspase-3 activation, decreased Bcl-2 expression, and MMP disruption. Furthermore, MCM treatment induced G1 cell cycle arrest which was mediated through significantly increased expression of p53, p21, and p27 and decreased expression of Cyclin D1 and PCNA in cancer cells. Finally, MCM treatment markedly enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>MCM possesses chemopreventive potential to reduce tumor growth by suppressing cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis in EAC cells via a mitochondrial dependent pathway, and activating the immune system.

Most lung cancers are diagnosed at advanced stages when treatments are less effective, pointing to the need for developing non-invasive screening strategies such as liquid biopsies. We tested the feasibility of detecting the presence of early stage (I-II) lung cancer using protein biomarkers carried by EVs in patient blood. Using an ACE microelectrode array, EVs were purified from NSCLC patient (N = 62; Stage I = 39, Stage II = 23) or control plasma (N = 390) and tested for the presence of cancer biomarker proteins with bead-based multiplex immunoassay kits. A machine learning algorithm based on recursive feature elimination with cross-validation was developed to identify the most important features for differentiation between cases and controls. The algorithm identified 10 protein biomarkers that were able to distinguish between the NSCLC and control patient samples with a receiver-operator characteristic (AUC) of 0.986 (95% CI: 0.976 - 0.996). Sensitivity was 66.1% at 99.2% specificity, rising to 79.0% and 93.6% sensitivity at 98.2% and 95.1% specificity, respectively. When further stratified, Stage I sensitivity was 53.8% and stage II sensitivity was 86.7% at the 99.2% specificity level. These results suggest that it is possible to detect early-stage NSCLC when treatments may be more effective, that EVs may carry the earliest signals of cancer development, and that a test based on blood-based EV-protein biomarkers can yield high sensitivity and specificity. Our results warrant investigation in larger datasets to validate the current observations with the potential application of this methodology for routine screening of at-risk populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-11 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Early detection,Extracellular vesicles,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juan P.
