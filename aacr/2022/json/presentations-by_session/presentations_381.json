[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>Oncolytic viruses (OVs), which selectively replicate in and destroy tumor cells, form a highly promising class of cancer therapeutics with a strong immune stimulatory potential. VSV-GP, a chimeric Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) pseudotyped with the glycoprotein of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (<i>LCMV<\/i>) can selectively replicate and express therapeutic cargos in the tumor microenvironment. Lymphotoxin alpha (LT&#945;) - a member of the TNF superfamily - may present as a potent therapeutic cargo based on its immune stimulatory and cell death modulatory characteristics.In this study, we explore the immune promoting and tumor cell death inducing properties of VSV-GP-LT&#945;, a next generation variant with an NF-&#954;B facilitated mode of action. We further investigate clinically relevant combination therapies with &#8220;second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases&#8221; mimetic compounds (SMCs).<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures: <\/b>Viral fitness, cargo expression and test substance quality were assessed using growth kinetic, ELISA, RT-qPCR and titration assays. Therapeutic efficacy and safety of VSV-GP-LT&#945;, with or without SMC co-treatment, were assessed in vivo in syngeneic C57BL\/6 mice bearing subcutaneous LLC1-IFNAR<sup>-\/- <\/sup>or B16F10-OVA tumors. To shed further light into the VSV-GP-LT&#945; treatment effects, we applied immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, multiplex ELISA and Nanostring&#174; assays.<br \/><b>Data Summary: <\/b>VSV-GP-LT&#945; induced stronger anti-tumor effects and increased overall survival compared to VSV-GP. It was also better tolerated than VSV-GP armed with TNF-&#945;, a therapeutic cargo from the same class. Histological and gene expression analysis confirmed widespread cell killing within the tumor and activation of innate and adaptive immune response markers. However, further characterization of the adaptive immune compartment did not show significant changes induced by the expressed LT&#945;. Building on the observed therapeutic strengths of VSV-GP-LT&#945;, we further explored a treatment combination with SMC. This resulted in a therapeutic synergy with improved treatment-induced tumor cell death, especially in a less permissive tumor setting.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Together, here we show that arming VSV-GP with LT&#945; resulted in a strong inflammation of the tumor microenvironment and enhanced levels of tumor cell death induction. This effect could be further enhanced by the co-treatment with SMC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9105d845-ca7b-4451-862b-99dce1cfb478\/@y03B8ZFW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Small molecule drugs,Combination therapy,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16807"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bart Spiesschaert<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Müller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katharina Angerer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krishna Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Nolden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carles Urbiola<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judy Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabian Heinemann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Birgit Stierstorfer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrik Erlmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guido Wollmann<\/i><\/presenter>.

It specifically blocks XPO1 enforcing the nuclear retention of tumor suppressor proteins restoring their anti-cancer functions. It also attenuates the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway by activating PTEN. Although activation of PI3K signaling is often detected in hematological malignancies, there are no data regarding the combination of selinexor with the PI3K inhibitor duvelisib for MM treatment. Thus, we evaluated the anti-myeloma effects of selinexor in combination with duvelisib <i>in vitro<\/i> and also studied alternative schedules of selinexor with dexamethasone <i>in vivo<\/i> using our MM xenograft models LAG&#954;-2.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The human MM cell line U266 was obtained from ATCC. Primary MM tumor cells were isolated from MM patients&#8217; bone marrow (BM) aspirates. Cell viability was quantified using the MTS cell proliferation assay. For the <i>in vivo<\/i> studies, the human myeloma xenograft LAG&#954;-2 was surgically implanted into SCID mice. Selinexor was administered via oral gavage at 2.5 mg\/kg 5x per week, 5 mg\/kg 4x per week on consecutive days, or 10 mg\/kg 2x per week with one day between treatments. Dexamethasone was administered via intraperitoneal injection at 4 mg\/kg 2x per week except the vehicle control.<br \/><b>Results and Discussion:<\/b> MTS assays showed selinexor induced concentration dependent inhibition of cell viability\/proliferation in the MM cell line MM1s at 0.1, 0.4 and 1.6 &#956;M. Selinexor alone at 0.2 &#956;M reduced cell proliferation of primary MM tumor cells obtained from BM mononuclear cells (MCs) from a patient with progressive disease. We next examined cell viability in the presence of selinexor and duvelisib. MM1s or fresh BM mononuclear cells were incubated with a fixed concentration of selinexor (0.1&#956;M) with increasing concentrations of duvelisib (1.5 &#956;M -25 &#956;M) for 48 h. The results showed that duvelisib enhanced the cytotoxic effects of selinexor in a concentration dependent manner. We also evaluated dosing and scheduling of selinexor and dexamethasone <i>in vivo<\/i> using SCID mice bearing LAG&#954;-2 MM xenografts. When selinexor was combined with dexamethasone, lower more frequent dosing showed greater inhibition of tumor growth than mid-range and higher less frequent dosing of this SINE. This study illustrates that the combination of selinexor and duvelisib showed enhanced cytotoxic effects <i>in vitro<\/i> compared with single agent treatment, and we will further evaluate the anti-MM effects of selinexor in combination with duvelisib <i>in vivo<\/i> using our human MM xenograft models. These studies suggest that the combination of a SINE and PI3K inhibitor may be effective for MM treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/646fd4bd-b1cc-4234-a226-abedc8ab82d7\/@z03B8ZFX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,In vitro,In vivo,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16809"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Haiming Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stacy Behare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingjie Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marissa Goldwater<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ava Hekmati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jasmin Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rocky Levin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ning Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>James Berenson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We have utilized an implantable microdevice performing cassette microdosing that measures intratumor drug responses and anti-tumor immunity for eleven agents in parallel. Local tumor response is measured by cyclical immunofluorescence for deep cellular response phenotyping. This approach is combined with the systemic administration of checkpoint inhibitors to examine whether local immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by a given drug microdose potentiates the immunotherapy&#8217;s anti-tumor effect. The measurements were performed in a humanized mouse model of clear cell renal cancer, patient derived xenograft (PDX) RXF488. RXF488 was implanted subcutaneously in 30 NSG mice. Animals were stratified into 6 groups with n= 4-6. Humanization was performed by the intravenous injection of 5x10e6 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells prior to the first treatment. Systemic anti-PD1 treatment was applied in the presence and absence of the microdevice loaded with eleven different drugs. Control groups received the empty microdevice in the presence or absence of PBMC. Beside the histological examination of the tumor tissue, flow cytometry (FC) was performed on bone marrow, spleen and tumor tissue to determine infiltration of human immune cells. FC analyses revealed no influence of the treatment on the human immune cells in bone marrow and spleen. The anti-PD1 treatment induced an increase in huCD45+ cells specifically in the tumor tissue only 48h after treatment. Several agents showed a significant increase in apoptosis induction when nivolumab was added: The largest increase was observed for the panRAF inhibitor LXH254, Sorafenib, Oxaliplatin and Doxorubicin. The increased efficacy from immunotherapy administration has a strong positive correlation with increased induction of ICD in the tumor microenvironment determined by CD11b, ICAM-1 and MHC-II expression: drugs that showed the highest increase in apoptosis when combined with aPD-1 showed an increased likelihood for markers associated with ICD, namely Oxaliplatin and LXH254. We were able to verify the results of the screening experiment in a conventional setting with systemic combination treatment arms in the same PDX model. Our results demonstrate that local tumor response signatures of ICD can be used to systemically identify synergistic combinations of a range of drugs with immunotherapy on a tumor specific basis. The approach may represent a new paradigm for efficient in vivo screening of novel combinations, particularly with combinations involving immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/78a899f0-21a7-4afa-9b46-c6a4eeec0843\/@z03B8ZFX\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Combination therapy,Screening,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16810"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Oliver Jonas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Oswald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kanstantsin Lashuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastian Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Julia Schüler<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Breast cancer is associated with defects in antigen presentation which may contribute to resistance to ICB. Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) is a growth factor that increases differentiation of DC1 dendritic cells, critical mediators of antigen presentation. CD40 agonist activates all 3 classes of antigen presenting cells - dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages. Synergy has been demonstrated between Flt3L and CD40 agonist as well as between CD40 agonist and chemotherapy in other cancers, however the combination of all three has not been studied in breast cancer.<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> 6-8 week old Balb\/c mice were injected with 4T1 triple negative breast cancer cells. When tumors were 50 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were first treated with intraperitoneal pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) once and subcutaneous Flt3L daily for 5 days in different sequencing schedules (PLD first followed by Flt3L immediately or 4 days later or Flt3L first followed by PLD 7 days or 10 days later). Based on optimal scheduling of PLD and Flt3L, mice were treated with PLD alone, Flt3L alone, CD40 agonist alone, PLD + Flt3L, PLD + CD40 agonist, PLD + PD-1 blockade, or PLD + CD40 agonist + Flt3L. In addition to serial tumor measurements, mice were sacrificed and tumors and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry analyses.<br \/><i>Results: <\/i>Treatment with PLD at least 4 days before Flt3L led to an optimal increase in intra-tumoral DC1 cells (p=0.0002), increase in polyfunctional CD8 T cell response (p&#60;0.0001), reduced PD-L1 expression on DC1 cells (p&#60;0.0001), and reduced PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells (p&#60;0.0001) compared to other sequencing schedules. Therefore, this regimen was advanced for further study. Treatment with novel triplet combination of PLD, Flt3L, and CD40 agonist resulted in improved tumor control and survival compared to PLD alone (p&#60;0.0001 and p&#60;0.0001, respectively), Flt3L alone (p&#60;0.0001 and p&#60;0.0001), CD40 agonist alone (p &#60;0.0001 and p&#60;0.0001), PLD + Flt3L (p&#60;0.0001 and p&#60;0.0001), PLD + CD40 agonist (p&#60;0.0001 and p&#60;0.0001), and PLD + PD-1 blockade (p&#60;0.0001 and p&#60;0.0001). 22% of mice were tumor-free in the triplet therapy group only and were resistant to tumor re-challenge. Treatment with triplet therapy was associated with an increase in antigen specific CD8 T cells. Additional mechanistic studies will also be presented.<br \/><i>Conclusions:<\/i> Novel triplet combination with PLD, CD40 agonist, and Flt3L leads to enhanced tumor control in the 4T1 TNBC mouse model.

Within the tumor, however, T cells are exposed to a plethora of inactivating factors causing various degrees of dysfunction, changes in metabolism and a generally reduced cellular fitness, eventually leading to tumor progression. To prevent or delay the onset of exhaustion and instead augment effector functions and persistence of functional T cells, costimulatory factors and cytokines are needed. Targeting 4-1BB (CD137), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, has been shown to represent a promising strategy for inducing an activating signal in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, resulting in increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, cytotoxic function, and survival. Engineered arenavirus vectors based on lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or Pichinde virus (PICV) have been shown previously to induce massive infiltration of tumor antigen specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells into the tumor in several preclinical cancer models. To investigate whether enhanced co-stimulation via 4-1BB further improves T cell responses and\/or tumor control, combination therapies with replicating LCMV based vectors (artLCMV) and 4-1BB agonists were explored. A single intravenous treatment of artLCMV encoding the tumor associated antigens (TAA) gp70 or Trp2 in B16.F10 tumor bearing mice induced TAA specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in both the periphery and the tumor, resulting in tumor growth delay and some complete responses. Combining artLCMV with agonistic anti-4-1BB significantly improved tumor control and increased the number of complete responders. Analysis of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes revealed higher absolute numbers of TAA specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the combination group compared to the artLCMV alone group. Analyses of the TAA specific cells revealed that more cells expressed granzyme B, Ki67 and Bcl-XL when co-stimulated with anti-4-1BB compared to the group treated with artLCMV alone. Importantly, encoding 4-1BBL in addition to a TAA in artLCMV revealed similar outcomes as just summarized for the combination with agonistic antibodies. Overall, these experiments confirmed the strong antigenicity and T cell inducing capacity of the engineered arenavirus platform, leading to efficient tumor control in a stringent mouse model. Combination with 4-1BB agonists, either in form of antibodies or encoded within the vector genome, was shown to further augment TAA-specific T cell responses within the tumor, leading to better tumor growth control and a higher rate of complete responders.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7f2150b4-b1a6-4b24-a87e-f93974077c22\/@z03B8ZFX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,4-1BBL,Cancer immunotherapy,Arenavirus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16812"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Judith Strauss<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marilies Scheinost<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theresa Kleissner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Reckendorfer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Pojar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed Habbeddine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Ahmadi-Erber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniela Deutschmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Schmidt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josipa Raguz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Matushansky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Lampert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Klaus K.

There is also significant expansion of&nbsp;Central Memory (CM)-phenotype CD8+&#8239;T cells (CD62L+CD44+) in the tumor and tumor draining lymph node. Here, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of NT-I7 in combination with a T cell activator,&nbsp;SLC-3010 (hIL-2\/TCB2c complex), in MC38&nbsp;tumor-bearing mice.&nbsp;Because TCB2 is an antibody specific for IL-2 that blocks interaction of IL-2 and IL-2R&#945; (CD25), SLC-3010 can selectively activate T cells while disfavoring Treg activation. Mice were administered a single dose of NT-I7&nbsp;or SLC-3010 via intramuscular or intravenous injection, respectively.&nbsp;The combination of NT-I7 with SLC-3010 enhanced the anti-tumor response with increased number and frequency of CD8+ T cells as well as granzyme B expression in the tumor. The number of CD8+ T cells peaked at day 4 and day 7 by SLC-3010 and NT-I7, respectively. The number of Tregs in the tumor was slightly increased by NT-I7 and SLC-3010, but it was not statistically significant.

In this study, we established and analyzed robust ICI resistance in in vivo models in order to identify new mechanisms and genes involved in acquired resistance. Resistant in vivo models were obtained by serial treatment\/reimplantation cycles in immunocompetent mice bearing MC38, MB49, MBT2, TyrNRas or RENCA tumors. Spectral cytometry was applied to characterize modifications in the tumor immune microenvironment. RNAseq analyses were performed to identify differences in gene expression profiles between sensitive parental models compared to their resistant counterparts. Alterations in the tumor immune microenvironment were highly heterogeneous amongst resistant models, and are thus considered representative for the diversity expected in patients. Each resistant model displayed multiple modifications in the tumor immune infiltrate in comparison to the respective wild type model, involving selected lymphoid and\/or myeloid subpopulations. For instance, in anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 resistant MC38 models, we observed a remarkable increase of FoxP3+CD4+ T cells while CD8+ Tem cells were decreased in anti PD-1 resistant models. We also found that the type 2 macrophage content was increased in the anti PD-1 resistant MB49 model. Gene profiling analyses demonstrated the variability associated with acquisition of a resistance phenotype. Alterations of pathways previously reported to be associated with resistance to ICIs were observed in some of our models while other genes appeared to be highly de-regulated in several models. For instance, in the anti PD-L1 resistant MBT2 model many signaling pathways were found to be up-regulated, such as HIF1&#945;, TGF&#946;, and ERK\/MAPK signaling. Several therapeutic combinations, in particular targeting alternative immune checkpoints, were found to reverse the resistance phenotype in selected models. Moreover, in accordance with flow cytometry results, in the anti PD-1 resistant MC38 model we observed a significant delay in tumor growth when a TNFR1 antibody was combined with a PD-1 antibody (p&#60;0.001). Acquired in vivo resistant models displayed strong diversity, both in terms of alterations of the tumor immune microenvironment and tumor gene expression profiles. Our model library, which may be enriched in the future with several other variants developed using the same methodology, provides an innovative tool to better understand the complexity and diversity of resistance to ICI and test resistance reversal strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7f29dd70-8d2d-4066-9240-d66ddda1145e\/@z03B8ZFX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Preclinical,Drug resistance,Immune checkpoint blockade,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16814"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Morgane Denis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chloé Grasselly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre-Antoine Choffour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Wierinckx<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Doriane Mathé<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kamel Chettab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Tourette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nolan Talhi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabian Birzele<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elsa Kress<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Petter Jordheim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Klein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva-Laure Matera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Dumontet<\/i><\/presenter>.

Current RT-induced systemic anti-tumoral immunity is dampened by defective tumor antigen presentation resulting in immune escape, an immunosuppressive TME, and the presence of anergic T cells in the immune privileged tumor draining lymph nodes. We have previously developed a proprietary non-ablative low intensity focused ultrasound (LOFU) therapy that induces unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in LOFU-treated cells and reverses T cell anergy in draining lymph nodes in a mouse model of metastatic melanoma. To further extend our findings to other solid tumors, we hypothesized that a combination of acoustic stress and immune priming by non-ablative LOFU, followed by ablative RT will promote the release of heat shock proteins and other damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) factors along with tumor-associated antigens for launching a systemic anti-tumor response in a murine breast cancer (TSA).<br \/>Methods: TSA cells and palpable orthotopic mammary tumors in BALB\/c thymic and athymic nude mice were treated with varying parameters of multi-frequency LOFU and RT (8-10 Gy\/fraction), over 1-3 consecutive days. Cell surface immunomodulation of TSA cells and tumor infiltrating immune cell populations were analyzed with flow cytometry and tumor volumes were recorded to calculate growth delay along with survival.<br \/>Results: LOFU-treated TSA cells exhibited an increase in cell surface chaperones, BiP\/GRP78, calreticulin, HSP70 and HSP90 at 24 hours post treatment. Furthermore, there was increased secretion of HMGB1, an immunomodulatory DAMP activator for dendritic cells. LOFU+RT-treated tumors had higher numbers of GP70 tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells by day 10 with higher levels of Ki67+ and GzB+ markers. In a dual tumor abscopal model, we observed significantly lower average tumor volumes of both the primary treated, and secondary untreated tumors, 35 days post treatment. There was a trend towards better tumor control and survival in mice with tumors treated with LOFU+RT, when compared to RT alone. Parallel studies in athymic immunodeficient mice failed to regress tumors treated with LOFU+RT.<br \/>Conclusions: LOFU + RT poses to be a promising combination therapy not only for elimination of primary tumor tissue but also the induction of a tumor-specific immune response. Further optimization of LOFU parameters is underway to maximize the immunogenic effects of LOFU+RT for combination therapy with immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e76a5c04-cc37-48d1-af70-8ecf759cc2af\/@z03B8ZFX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Ultrasound,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16815"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michelle M.

Historical approaches to treating glioblastoma (GBM) using chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells (CAR-T) have been challenging, without a lasting benefit to patients, often due to tumor heterogeneity and a lack of tumor specific antigens. We report preliminary <i>in vitro<\/i> design and optimization of a &#947;&#948; T cell-based CAR-T using Chlorotoxin (CLTX-CAR), a peptide isolated from the venom of the Israeli Deathstalker Scorpion that efficiently binds to GBM and other tumor cells with limited cross reactivity to normal tissues. This CLTX-CAR (CTLX-CAR-noZ) omits a CD3z signaling domain to maintain the natural innate targeting and tumor recognition properties of the &#947;&#948; T cell through its endogenous T cell and NKG2D receptors, and CD16-based antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This construct also includes our Drug Resistant Immunotherapy (DRI) platform that incorporates an additional p140K-MGMT encoding gene into the construct. This confers resistance to alkylating agents such as temozolomide (TMZ) that allows our DRI &#947;&#948; T cells to remain viable and functional when combined with chemotherapy to force high-expression of natural killer group D ligands (NKG2DL) on the surface of tumor cells. As expected, the non-signaling, CLTX-CAR-noZ modified Jurkat cells did not result in T cell activation, as compared to the highly activated CD69 corresponding to signaling CLTX-CAR-CD3z transduced Jurkat cells. Conversely, CTLX-CAR-noZ transduced &#947;&#948; T cells demonstrated higher cytotoxicity against U87MG and U251MG GBM cell lines over unmodified control &#947;&#948; T cells. Dual-CLTX-CAR constructs lacking CD3z and using 2x CLTX peptides as the targeting domain (dCLTX-CAR-noZ) exhibited up to 90% lentiviral transduction efficiency into &#947;&#948; T cells. When co-cultured in suspension with GBM cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, dCLTX-CAR-noZ &#947;&#948; T cells demonstrated an average cytotoxicity of 62.1% against U87MG-GFP cells at an E:T ratio of 4:1 in comparison to 35.4% with non-transduced &#947;&#948; T control cells. Time-lapsed microscopic recording over a period of 15hrs also verified killing of U251MG-GFP cells by dCLTX-CAR-noZ &#947;&#948; T cells when cocultured with GBM cells at an E:T ratio of 2:1. Serial-killing of tumor cells by &#947;&#948; T cells was documented. We are advancing this approach to xenograft animal models and as a clinical development candidate (INB-300) for both GBM and other extracranial tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63eba923-b0f3-469f-bfdf-781b0e249b54\/@z03B8ZFX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,CAR T cells,gamma delta T cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16816"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lei Ding<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanjie Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evan Klumpp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lawrence Lamb Jr.<\/i><\/presenter>.

To date, immune-mediated therapies have shown little success in this population in part due to the absence of neoantigens in these tumors and strong immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) preventing T cell activation. Our laboratory has developed a novel microbial-based immunotherapeutic strategy for selective delivery of a highly immunogenic tetanus toxoid protein (TT856-1313) into tumor cells through in vivo infection with attenuated Listeria monocytogenes. In mice previously vaccinated against TT, this leads to reactivation of pre-existing TT-specific memory T cells which kill the infected tumor cells in mouse models of pancreatic cancer. The addition of gemcitabine (GEM) improves T cell responses by reducing immune suppression in the TME. We hypothesize that the regimen Listeria-TT+GEM will have efficacy in vivo in mice with advanced ovarian cancer.<br \/>Methods: Infection and killing of mouse and human ovarian tumor cells by Listeria-TT was analyzed in vitro. C57Bl\/6 mice were vaccinated with the TT vaccine at six weeks of age. 3x106 luciferase-expressing ID8 syngeneic mouse tumor cells (Id8-Luc) were injected IP and tumor growth was monitored by Vivo Imaging Systems (IVIS.) Mice were divided into four treatment groups: saline, GEM, Listeria-TT, and Listeria-TT+GEM. Quantification of tumor burden was approximated by total flux (photons\/second) within a region of interest (ROI) prior to, during, and at completion of therapy (days 0, 9, and 19 after tumor cell injection, respectively).<br \/>Results: In vitro analyses demonstrated efficient infection and killing of mouse Id8-Luc and chemoresistant human Hey ovarian tumor cells by Listeria-TT. The response of tumors and metastases to the four prespecified treatment regimens was evaluated by IVIS as described above. On Day 0, there was no significant difference in the quantified tumor burden between the four treatment groups. On Days 9 and 19, the tumor burden was significantly less in the Listeria-TT+GEM group compared to the saline group (Mann-Whitney p=0.0159). Neither GEM nor Listeria-TT alone were significantly different from the saline group on day 9, but the effect of GEM was significantly different from saline on day 19 (p=0.0079). In a follow up study, the survival time of the Listeria-TT+GEM-treated mice was improved by 50% compared to the saline mice. The survival of GEM compared to saline is under investigation.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Listeria-TT+GEM strongly reduced metastatic ovarian cancer in mice. Additional experiments are ongoing to evaluate if more treatment cycles of Listeria-TT+GEM further improves the survival time. This study suggest that the combination therapy may be promising for human application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f99568fe-ec50-41fa-b5f5-902db9ac423b\/@z03B8ZFX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Immunotherapy,Bacterial therapy,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16817"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lisa R.

Chemotherapy and more recently its combination with immunotherapy are the standard of care for extensive stage SCLC. Although this combinatorial treatment provides clinical benefit, it can be hampered by the effect of chemotherapy on inducing immunosuppression. Cyclin dependent kinases 4\/6 (CDK4\/6) phosphorylate retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and promote proliferation of Rb-intact hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) by allowing cells to progress through S phase. Rb loss is a signature mutation in SCLC tumors, making these tumor cells unresponsive to CDK4\/6 inhibition. Therefore, we hypothesized that CDK4\/6 inhibitors could be utilized to block the proliferation of Rb-intact HSPCs and protected them from chemotherapy without altering the effect of chemotherapy on Rb-deficient SCLC cells. We treated Rb-deficient SCLC cancer cells and Rb-intact NK and T cells with increasing concentrations of cisplatin, etoposide and topotecan with or without the CDK4\/6 inhibitor G1T28. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed using CellTiter-Glo, Annexin V staining, and PI-based cell cycle analysis. <i>In vitro<\/i>, CDK4\/6 inhibition did not alter the impact of chemotherapy on Rb-deficient SCLC cell viability, whereas with Rb-intact NK and T cells, CDK4\/6 inhibitor treatment induced cell cycle arrest and prevented apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents. In the TKOTmG Rb-deficient mouse model of SCLC, CDK4\/6 inhibition improved the efficacy of cisplatin plus etoposide. In vivo studies using the KP-1 syngeneic mouse models showed that treatment with a CDK4\/6 inhibitor improved the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy individually or chemo-immunotherapy combinations by reducing the tumor growth rate and prolonging animal survival. CDK4\/6i treatment prior to chemotherapy preserved white blood cell counts in comparison to chemotherapy alone. Tissue and blood immune marker analysis showed that CDK4\/6 inhibitor treatment increased both the circulating and tumor-resident NK cells. Collectively, we demonstrated that CDK4\/6 inhibition does not antagonize the therapeutic impact of chemotherapy on Rb-deficient SCLC cells but enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in KP-1 syngeneic SCLC mouse model. CDK4\/6i also at least partially abrogated the chemotherapy-induced reductions in subpopulatons of immune cells. CDK4\/6 inhibition may be considered as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression and enhance antitumor immunity in SCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/da7317c6-7bb2-4d03-88a7-87b962e68c98\/@z03B8ZFX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,PD-1,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16818"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thiruvengadam Arumugam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene G.

Targeted and combinatorial-based clinical trial therapies have shown poor efficacy in GBM treatment, partly due to the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, GBM&#8217;s heterogeneity and adaptability, and GBM&#8217;s ability to metastasize and invade critical regions of the brain. However, promising recent literature has indicated that neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 checkpoint-inhibition immunotherapy - i.e., starting it right before surgery for recurrence - improves survival outcomes in human GBM patients.<br \/>Results: Here, we demonstrate a proposed mechanism of action wherein localized intratumoral danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP, a known immunogenic driver) injection of calreticulin - used to mimic natural DAMP release from necrotic cells during surgery - combined with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy leads to better survival outcomes in both orthotopic mouse CT2A and CT2A-Luc GBM models. This survival benefit is also seen in a more aggressive (larger tumor inoculation size) orthotopic CT2A-Luc GBM model. Flow cytometry indicates increased microglia cell counts and activation marker expression, and increased myeloid activation marker expression in mice brains treated with our combination immunotherapy in a CT2A GBM model. Additionally, in vivo treatment with our combination immunotherapy led to increases in the local T and NK cell numbers, the CD8:CD4 ratio, and the proliferation of CD4 T cells in mice brains of a CT2A GBM model. In vitro results suggest that co-culture with CT2A cells increased PD-1 expression in macrophages and microglia and that our combination treatment of calreticulin and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy reduces the viability of mouse GBM cells when mixed with macrophages.<br \/>Significance: This project paves the path for a novel immunotherapeutic approach to tackle GBM and other cancers. Future studies could incorporate relevant DAMP&#8217;s into nanoparticles for sustained release after intratumoral injection and possibly viral delivery of DAMP&#8217;s that are constitutively secreted, thereby prolonging an anticipated immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d511f56e-7c97-4a29-b378-91b281ececa8\/@A03B8ZFY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Glioblastoma,Immunogenic cell death,Damage-associated molecular patterns,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16819"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Suchet Taori<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Breanna Noffsinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlotte A.

One approach to augment the efficacy of ICIs in NSCLC is to enhance anti-tumor T cell responses by utilizing <i>in situ<\/i> vaccination (ISV) with professional antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs). In preclinical studies as well as a phase I clinical trial, we have shown that ISV with gene-modified DCs expressing CCL21 (CCL21-DC) promotes effector T lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor, PD-L1 upregulation, and systemic tumor-specific immune responses. We hypothesized that <i>in situ<\/i> vaccination with CCL21-DC could promote T cell priming and activation, thereby sensitizing non-responsive NSCLC tumors to ICI. Utilizing multiple syngeneic murine models of NSCLC with distinct driver mutations [<i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>\/P53<sup>+\/-<\/sup>\/Lkb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> (KPL); <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>\/P53<sup>+\/-<\/sup> <\/i>(KP); and <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> <\/i>(K)]<i> <\/i>and varying TMB, we observed that CCL21-DC ISV synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy resulting in the eradication of a subset of tumors. Evaluation of KPL tumors by flow cytometry and scRNA-seq revealed that combination therapy reprogrammed the myeloid compartment to be less immunosuppressive, and induced T cell infiltration, Th1 polarization, as well as the enrichment of stem-like TCF1+ T cells within the TME. Intratumoral (IT) CCL21-DC enhanced CD103<sup>+<\/sup>DC migration to the local lymph node as determined by flow cytometry. Addition of ICI to IT CCL21-DC resulted in enhanced T cell proliferation and INF-&#947; secretion within the TME and the spleen. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of tumors revealed immunoediting of tumor subclones after IT CCL21-DC and ICI combination therapy. Tumor rechallenge studies demonstrated the establishment of systemic tumor-specific immunity in a subset of mice that were cured of disease.In conclusion, tumor vaccination with CCL21-DC sensitizes immune-resistant murine NSCLC to anti-PD-1 therapy. Combination therapy enhances anti-tumor T cell responses, resulting in immunoediting of tumor subclones and the generation of systemic tumor-specific immunity. In an ongoing clinical trial, we are evaluating the safety and efficacy of ISV with CCL21-DC in combination with anti-PD-1, pembrolizumab, in patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed on front-line therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10313d70-ffb8-480d-b689-94aa5b8555a1\/@A03B8ZFY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,Vaccines,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16820"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ramin Salehi-Rad<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raymond J.

Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has evolved the current treatment landscape with robust and durable responses in approximately 20% of patients with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as well as in treatment-na&#239;ve advanced disease. Inefficient tumor antigen presentation, diminished T cell infiltration into tumor and LKB1-inactivating mutations contribute to the mechanisms of resistance to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in NSCLC. LKB1 deficiency also facilitates an immunosuppressive environment that promotes tumor growth. One approach to overcome this immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is to utilize <i>in situ<\/i> vaccination with gene-modified functional antigen presenting cells (APCs) to enhance tumor antigen presentation and promote tumor-specific T cell activation. It has been shown that the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 (CXCL9\/10) are important signaling molecules secreted by CD103<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cells (DCs) to orchestrate the anti-tumor immunity. Thus, we hypothesize that intratumoral (IT) injection of CXCL9\/10-secreting DCs (CXCL9\/10-DCs) can potentiate the response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy in LKB1-deficient NSCLC by promoting antigen presentation and inducing T cell infiltration. Our preliminary data shows that CXCL9\/10-DC injection modulates systemic immunity and generates anti-tumor responses that are augmented by the combination treatment with anti-PD1. In an <i>in vivo<\/i> murine model of Lkb1-null lung cancer bearing high tumor mutational burden (TMB), CXCL9\/10-DC facilitates recruitment of effector T cells into the TME and tumor-specific T cell activation. These studies will enhance our understanding of anti-tumor immunity mediated by <i>in situ <\/i>DC vaccination and facilitate the improvement of novel vaccine therapies.<br \/>B. Liu and S. M.

CD38 is highly expressed on MM cells, and antibodies targeting CD38 (such as Isatuximab and Daratumumab) induce MM cell killing though several mechanisms, particularly by NK cell-mediated antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, NK cells also express CD38 and treatment with anti-CD38 antibodies results in a rapid decrease of NK cells presumably due to fratricide, which may potentially limit NK cell mediated ADCC and reduce the efficacy of anti-CD38 antibody treatment. NK cells lacking CD38 in combination with Daratumumab have been shown to be resistant to NK cell fratricide and have improved ADCC. Here, we investigated the effect of knocking out CD38 in K-NK cells (CD38KO K-NK) in combination with Isatuximab. Peripheral blood NK cells were isolated from healthy donors and expanded using Kiadis PM21 particle technology (Oyer et al, Cytotherapy 2016) to produce highly activated K-NK cells. To produce CD38KO K-NK cells, CRISPR gene editing was applied during NK cell expansion by electroporating with Cas9\/RNP complexes targeting CD38, and successful deletion of CD38 was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. Analysis of key NK cell receptors by flow cytometry evidenced very similar receptor profiles between WT and CD38KO K-NK cells, suggesting that CD38 deletion does not affect the potent activation state of the K-NK cells. Importantly, CD38KO K-NK cells were found to be resistant to Isatuximab-induced fratricide. The cytotoxic activity of CD38KO K-NK cells in combination with Isatuximab against LP-1 and H929 MM cell lines was also measured. Calcein release assay and Incucyte based analysis revealed that cytotoxicity of CD38KO K-NK cells is enhanced in presence of Isatuximab, and that CD38KO K-NK cells are more cytotoxic than WT when combined with Isatuximab. Furthermore, the effect of Isatuximab\/CD38KO K-NK cells combination also in association with SAR444245 (also termed THOR-707; Ptacin et al, Nat Commun 2021), an engineered non-&#945; binding IL-2 that promotes NK cell activation and proliferation, was tested. Cytotoxicity of WT or CD38KO NK cells is enhanced in the presence of SAR444245. Indeed, addition of SAR444245 was found to further enhance the cytotoxic activity of CD38KO K-NK cells against LP-1 MM cells when combined with Isatuximab, resulting in an overall superior and sustained cytotoxicity. These data suggest that deletion of CD38 mitigates NK cell fratricide and improves Isatuximab-mediated ADCC against MM cells, and provide evidence for the therapeutic potential of the triple combination CD38KO NK cells, Isatuximab and SAR444245 in the setting of MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b5fb071f-ec29-4d16-b613-e1a000b26daa\/@A03B8ZFY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,CD38,Natural killer cells,ADCC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16825"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marco Meloni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pauline Perrin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik Slinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chrissta Maracle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Fournier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Acuff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jill Mooney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Y.

Effectiveness of ICIs have been limited by both primary and acquired resistance. In addition, absence of T cell infiltration within the tumor site is one of the major obstacles limiting ICIs efficacy against solid tumors. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent immune stimulator that has been shown to stimulate growth and survival of T cells as well as NK cells. Utilizing a B16.F10 melanoma model in C57Bl\/6 mice, we observed a significant reduction in T regulatory cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells while T effector cells were significantly increased within the tumor microenvironment (TME) following intratumor delivery of a plasmid encoding IL-12 using gene electrotransfer. Monotherapy with plasmid IL-12 delivered with gene electrotransfer (pIL-12 GET) resulted in prolonged disease-free survival as well as long term immune memory. To determine the robustness of this therapeutic approach and to evaluate the responsiveness in combination with anti-PD1, we used a two-tumor model consisting of a subcutaneous B16F10 tumor and B16F10 cells expressing luciferase injected via the intraperitoneal route in a C57Bl\/6 mouse. Intratumor delivery of pIL-12 GET as a monotherapy resulted in reduction or elimination of the subcutaneous tumor. However, the monotherapy approach was only successful in reducing the peritoneal spread in about 50% of the mice. When pIL-12 GET was combined with anti-PD1 administered via an intraperitoneal injection not only was there an elimination of the subcutaneous tumor, but it resulted in the elimination of intraperitoneal metastatic growth. The elimination of peritoneal spread was confirmed utilizing an In Vivo Imaging System. Observations on day 60 revealed background levels of luminescence in 90% of mice treated with the combination therapy thus confirming long-term disease-free survival of these mice. This level of response was not seen in mice treated with anti-PD-1 alone or with simple injection of pIL-12. In addition, the combination therapy resulted in an enhanced memory response which protected against growth of new tumors following challenge. In addition, exposure of tumor cells to IL-12 resulted in upregulation of MHC class 1 and PDL1 expression. The results have this study suggest that the combination of pIL-12 GET combined with ICIs could be utilized as an effective combination therapy for melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e5c7e22c-fdf6-48a1-ac6c-e45ebd377f42\/@A03B8ZFY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Metastasis,Cytokines,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16826"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Richard Heller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan Scott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cathryn Mangiamele<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jody Synowiec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guilan Shi<\/i><\/presenter>.

We recently demonstrated that low metronomic dose of PARP inhibitor synergizes with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, in part, by modulating the suppressive function of MDSCs via a reduction in Arg1 and iNOS but independently of DNA damage and STING (<i>PMC7839867<\/i>). The non-antibiotic properties of minocycline (Mc) include its ability to moderately inhibit PARP. We took advantage of Mc as a weak PARP inhibitor to explore its potential on tumorigenesis and immune suppression in colon cancer models. In this study, we show that Mc significantly reduced Arg1 and iNOS in bone marrow (BM)-derived MDSCs both at the mRNA and protein levels. Paradoxically, such strong effect did not culminate in a substantial modulation of MDSCs suppressive function as assessed by co-cultured anti-CD3\/CD28-stimulated CFSE-labeled T cells proliferation. However and similarly to PARP inhibitors, Mc increased PD-L1 expression in several cell types. We thus speculated that the antibiotic might enhance anti-cancer immunotherapy and explored such potential in a MC-38 and CT-26 cell-based mouse models of colon cancer representing the MSI and MSS traits of the disease. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with low metronomic doses of Mc (0.5 or 5mkg) promoted a substantial reduction in tumor size in the MC-38 cell-based model (MSI) without an apparent superiority of any of the two doses. Surprisingly, neither dose of Mc exerted appreciable effects on tumor size in the CT-26 cell-based model (MSS). The anti-tumor effect of Mc in the MSI model was associated with a significant reduction in intratumoral monocytic-MDSC population. While MDSCs harvested from tumors of control mice re-infiltrated <i>ex vivo<\/i> generated MC-38 cell-based organoids, MDSCs harvested from tumors of Mc-treated mice failed to re-infiltrate the organoids. This suggests that Mc may interfere with MDSCs intratumorally infiltration. The Mc concentrations used in this study exerted little to no effect on bacterial growth suggesting that the observed effects were independent of the antibiotic properties of the drug. Unlike the effects observed <i>in vitro<\/i>, Mc treatment reduced intratumoral PD-L1 while increasing IFN&#947;. The discrepancy may be associated with intratumoral stress condition as assessed by Chop protein levels and reproduced in vitro by serum starvation. Although the metronomic Mc dose and anti-PD1 administration caused a significant reduction in tumor size individually, the combination therapy promoted a 66.7% curing of the tumors. Our results propose repurposing Mc at metronomic doses as a new approach to enhance efficacy of immunotherapy for patients with MSI colon cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/375d7808-694d-4b88-a043-32b25defd96b\/@A03B8ZFY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Colorectal cancer,MDSC,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16827"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Salome V.

Recent studies reveal that responses to PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade are associated with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration and high baseline PD-L1 expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME), while impaired tumor antigen presentation and the immunosuppressive TME have been associated with resistance to ICB. One approach to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance is to intratumorally vaccinate NSCLC tumors with gene modified conventional dendritic cells (cDC), specifically the type I conventional DC (cDC1) lineage. Recent studies have established that generation of an anti-tumor immune response driven by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells requires the cross presentation of tumor associated antigens and that cDC1s are the primary cross presenting APC subtype <i>in vivo, <\/i>which can license CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells to initiate an adaptive anti-tumor immune response. In addition, previous studies have shown that intratumoral administration of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) protein can expand endogenous CD103<sup>+ <\/sup>cDC1 cells in the TME and augment anti-tumor immune responses to ICB therapy. Here, we engineered murine CD103<sup>+ <\/sup>cDC1 cells to constitutively secrete soluble FLT3L (FLT3L_cDC1) and performed <i>in situ<\/i> vaccination studies on anti-PD1 resistant murine models of NSCLC with LKB1-deficiency and elevated TMB that better represents human disease. The FLT3L_cDC1 cells showed enhanced anti-tumor efficacy compared to non-modified cDC1 cells and synergized with anti-PD-1 ICB to inhibit tumor growth. Our data suggests intratumoral injection of FLT3L_cDC1 cells may represent a promising strategy to potentiate the efficacy of ICB and improve outcomes for patients with primary resistance PD-1\/PD-L1 monotherapy.<br \/>*B.

Therapeutic strategies include surgical resection, radiotherapy, liver transplantation and pharmacological treatment with small-molecules multikinase inhibitors and\/or immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB); however, outcomes remain poor and improvements to systemic therapy are desperately needed. Recently, Cabozantinib a kinase inhibitor with activity against VEGFR2, AXL and cMET, has been approved for second line use in advanced HCC; however, monotherapy achieves less than a 4-month extension of overall survival. Previously, our collaborators demonstrated that the efficacy of cMet inhibition is self-limited by induction of high PD-L1 expression. Given this data, the goal of our study was to investigate the efficacy of combining cMet inhibition with either capmatinib or cabozantinib with antibody blockade of the PD-1 immune checkpoint receptor for therapy of HCC. Using multiple syngeneic, immunocompetent models of HCC (Hepa1-6, HCA) in two different strains of mice (C57BL6, C3H), we investigated the combination potential of each of these cMet inhibitors with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Further, we profiled the changes to the tumor infiltrating myeloid and T cell repertoires which correlated to mono- as well as combination therapy responses in these animals using high content flow cytometry on a BD X-30. We found Hepa1-6 to be exquisitely anti-PD-1 sensitive with 100% of animals being cured by the combination. In the less immunotherapy-sensitive HCA-1 model, we also found that the cMet inhibitors cooperate with PD-1 blockade to promote rejection of HCA-1 HCC model. Again, we found that combination therapy could cure nearly all animals of pre-implanted HCA-1 tumors. Mechanistically, we found that concomitant cMet inhibition enhances the efficacy of PD-1 therapy increasing the number of tumor-infiltrating CD4 Teff cells while decreasing the CD4 Treg population. We also found that combined therapy improves CD8+ T cell infiltration, memory CD8 T cell fraction and NK cytotoxic potential within the tumor microenvironment. Within the HCA-1 myeloid compartment, we discovered a significant decrease in the tumor-associated neutrophil (N2-TAN) population (PMN-MDSC). Further, we found that combination therapy promotes pro-inflammatory M1 conversion of stromal macrophages. Collectively, these data provide a rationale for combining anti-PD-1 therapy with cMet inhibitors as a potential strategy to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6e76c205-f338-49d2-a33c-67f8f54479f8\/@A03B8ZFY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,c-Met,Resistance,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16830"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"1813111a-2c35-4353-bcd5-db1baf43e0a8","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1813111a-2c35-4353-bcd5-db1baf43e0a8\/@A03B8ZFY\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ricardo Alexandre De Azevedo Sr.<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsieh Cheng-En Sr.<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priyamvada Jayaprakash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krithikaa Rajkumar Bhanu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anupallavi Srinivasamani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brittany Morrow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Winkler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shweta Mahendra Hedge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arthur Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael A.

PD-1 is commonly co-expressed on TILs, and PD-1 mediated SHP-2 signaling inhibits DNAM-1 (CD226), preventing PVR co-stimulation in the setting of TIGIT blockade. The interaction between PD-1 and CD226 explains why TIGIT blockade only translates to clinical benefit in the setting of co-blockade of PD-1\/L1, however does not explain why co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1\/L1 does not provide benefit in advanced and PD-1\/L1 resistant tumors. In advanced and PD-1\/L1 resistant tumors, progressive downregulation of CD226 has been reported. Thus, we hypothesized that the lack of CD226 may underlie the lack of clinical responses to combined TIGIT\/PD-1\/L1 blockade in PD-1\/L1 experienced tumors and we sought to identify alternative costimulatory receptors with high-expression. Analysis of TCGA, as well as single-cell RNASeq from TILs, identified HVEM and LT&#946;R as two costimulatory receptors with higher expression in advanced cancers as compared to CD226. HVEM and LT&#946;R directly activate CD8+ T, natural killer (NK), and myeloid cells when bound by their TNF superfamily ligand, known as LIGHT. LIGHT potentiates effector lymphocyte function through signaling that obviates the co-stimulatory role of DNAM-1. We demonstrated that when the extracellular domain (ECD) of LIGHT is combined with the ECD of TIGIT on a TIGIT-Fc-LIGHT bi-functional fusion protein, the simultaneous blockade of PVR, PVRL2, PVRL3, and Nectin-4 and immune co-stimulation by LIGHT increased CD8+ T and NK infiltration into tumors. This translated into tumor cell killing, regression of established tumors, and improved survival in preclinical models of checkpoint primary and acquired resistance. The translation of TIGIT-Fc-LIGHT activity was evaluated in cynomolgus macaques and was well tolerated at doses up to 40 mg\/kg. A series of adaptive immune and proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-2, CCL2, CCL4, IL-10, CXCL10, and CCL17, were induced within two hours of TIGIT-Fc-LIGHT infusion. Additionally, receptor engagement led to the rapid margination of HVEM+CD8+ T cells from the periphery into secondary immune tissues. This network of cytokines and post-dose immune cell margination identified in the monkey, was identical to findings in murine models that ultimately translated into significant anti-tumor responses. Lastly, the combination of TIGIT-Fc-LIGHT with anti-PD(L)1 broadened anti-tumor activity of the checkpoint antibodies in aggressive CPI-resistant tumors. These results suggest that LIGHT could be the differentiator that extends the clinical activity of conventional CPIs into PD-L1 low or CPI acquired resistance tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/162a6b91-9797-4e01-a588-3930e8bc96e9\/@A03B8ZFY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,Costimulation,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16831"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kyung Jin Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louis Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kellsey Johannes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayalakshmi Miriyala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen Lenz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Campbell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suresh De Silva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor H.

However, their wide-spread clinical use has been limited by transient immune responses and serious side-effects. Here, we propose the use of a multi-adjuvant approach that combines two different classes of adjuvants, STING and TLR 7\/8 agonists, based on their distinct immune cell targets, signalling pathways, and significant roles in the activation and maintenance of immune responses. We evaluated the potential of combining 522, a novel TLR 7\/8 agonist, and DMXAA, a STING agonist, for stronger DC activation and greater CD8 T cell responses. Mouse bearing B16F10-OVA (murine melanoma cell line which expresses ovalbumin) tumors were immunized with OVA mixed with 522 or DMXAA or a combination of 522 and DMXAA daily for 5 days. Immunization with OVA+DMXAA+522 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition (p &#60; 0.05) and improved survival (p&#60;0.05) compared to other controls. Using flow cytometry, the costimulatory molecule expression and immune cell infiltration in mouse lymph node, spleen and tumor were evaluated. Immunization with OVA+DMXAA+522 resulted in the activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) in lymph nodes, spleen and tumor (additive or equivalent to single treated groups). The combination also elicited stronger antigen specific CD8 T cell and natural killer (NK) cell responses than control or individual treatment groups. OVA + DMXAA+ 522 immunization increased the number of OVA-specific CD44<sup>high<\/sup> CD8 T cells by over 4-fold compared to other treatment groups and control mice in spleen and lymph nodes. A reduction in the frequency of M2 macrophages was observed with OVA+DMXAA+522 treatment. Cytokine analysis demonstrated higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN&#947; and lower levels of pro-tumorigenic cytokines in the serum of OVA+DMXAA+522 immunized mice compared to that in untreated or OVA-only treated mice. Taken together, these results suggest that combination of TLR7\/8 and STING agonists is a promising multi-adjuvant approach for cancer vaccination","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5dc2ad98-8fc2-4974-819b-950e92c4e168\/@B03B8ZFZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,TLR7\/8 ,STING ,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16832"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shubhmita Bhatnagar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vishnu Revuri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manan Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Larson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Ferguson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayanth Panyam<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, 40% of patients fail to respond or develop resistance to the treatment, and the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here we utilize the syngeneic 9464D-GD2 mouse model to investigate the role of neuroblastoma tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in developing resistance to the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody Dinutuximab. Neuroblastoma-derived sEVs significantly attenuated the efficacy of Dinutuximab treatment in vivo. Mechanistically, both RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry analysis of whole tumors demonstrated that neuroblastoma-derived sEVs modulate immune cells tumor infiltration upon Dinutuximab treatment to create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which contains more tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and fewer tumor-infiltrating NK cells, in addition to suppression of splenic NK cell maturation in vivo. Moreover, neuroblastoma-derived sEVs suppressed Dinutuximab-mediated NK cell antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vitro. Importantly, Tipifarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that inhibits sEV secretion, drastically enhanced the efficacy of Dinutuximab in vivo and reversed the immunosuppressive effects of neuroblastoma-derived sEVs. Notably, Tipifarnib modulated immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow to disfavor the formation of CD11b+Ly6C<sup>high<\/sup>Ly6G<sup>low<\/sup> subpopulations, which are the precursors for TAMs. Taken together, these preclinical findings uncover a novel mechanism by which neuroblastoma-derived sEVs modulate the immune system to promote resistance to Dinutuximab and suggest that Tipifarnib-mediated inhibition of sEV secretion may serve as a viable treatment strategy to improve immunotherapy in high-risk patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f48fe72-db7a-4f6e-a90a-87f986dc7cd0\/@B03B8ZFZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Immunotherapy,Neuroblastoma,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16833"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaoming Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carson A.

Regenerative stem-cell memory CD62L<sup>hi<\/sup>CD44<sup>low<\/sup>Sca1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (T<sub>SCM<\/sub>) persist longer and produce cells with more vital effector functions. OX40, a member of TNFRSF4, has been shown to promote the expansion and proliferation of activated effector T cells, leading to the generation of robust anti-tumor responses and immune memory. However, treatment with anti-OX40 as a single therapeutic modality has not generated desirable clinical outcomes. A combination of immune modulators has been found to enhance the therapeutic efficacy synergistically. Recently, we reported that inhibition of MEK1\/2 using selumetinib (AZD6244) leads to a significant increase in the numbers of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T<sub>SCM<\/sub> cells with self-renewability, enhanced multipotency and proliferative capacity, leading to potent anti-tumor effects. Therefore, here we combined selumetinib with anti-OX40 to investigate if enhanced immune-mediated anti-tumor responses could be obtained. Using three mouse tumor models (TC1, B16, and CT26), we found that combination of MEKi with anti-OX40 enhances the anti-tumor activity by increasing the expansion of total and antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the TME. These CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells have higher functional activity as seen by increased Granzyme B and INF-&#947; production. We also found similar results after adoptive cell therapy (ACT) where infusion of MEKi-treated cells in B16 tumor-bearing mice synergized with anti-OX40 agonist treatment. Interestingly, anti-OX40 treatment of MEKi-treated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells enhanced the metabolic fitness as demonstrated by low mitochondrial potential and enhanced Oxygen Consumption Rates (OCR), Spare Respiratory Capacity (SRC), and Extra-cellular Acidification Rates (ECAR) compared to anti-OX40 treatment alone. Furthermore, OX40 agonist significantly enhanced the longevity of MEKi-induced CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T<sub>SCM<\/sub> cells. In summary, our data provide a novel strategy to utilize MEKi to enhance the efficacy of ACT and combination immunotherapy using anti-OX40 agonist.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/59c34136-8650-4b75-b650-7fea8a7f18ad\/@B03B8ZFZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MEK inhibitor,OX40,Tumor microenvironment,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16834"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pankaj Gaur<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivek Verma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mays Alreem Elayyan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zainab Ramlaoui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon T.

Although various treatments are available for CRC, survival rates of CRC patients remain very poor. In the last few decades, Inhibition of immune checkpoint proteins have been shown to be a promising strategy for CRC treatments, thus allowing T cells to destroy CRC cells. 6-gingerol, an active compound present in fresh ginger have been shown to possess anti-cancer and immunomodulatory properties. We have previously described the anti-metastatic effect 6-gingerol in CRC. However, there is paucity of information on the effect 6-gingerol on CD8+ T cell function and immune checkpoints proteins in CRC. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of 6-gingerol on CD8+ T cells function and immune check point proteins in using mice model of CRC and system biology approach. Male BALB\/c mice were divided into four groups of 10 mice each. Group 1 mice serve as control, group 2 mice received 6-gingerol 10mg\/kg\/day by oral gavage for 10 weeks. Group 3 (CRC model) mice received a single dose of azoxymethane 10mg\/kg (Intraperitoneal) and on the seventh day they received three cycles of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) 2% (W\/V) in drinking water (each cycle is defined as one week of 2% DSS followed by two weeks of plain drinking water) Group 4 mice received 6-gingerol 10mg\/kg\/day by oral gavage in combination with single dose of azoxymethane 10mg\/kg (iP) and three cycles of 2% DSS (W\/V) in drinking water. Administration of 6-gingerol to AOM\/DSS treated mice increase the percentage (%) gated cells population of CD8+Tcells and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) with concomitant decrease in % gated population of Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and B-7 proteins as compared to AOM\/DSS only treated mice. Furthermore, there was decrease expression of PD-L1 on colon tissues of 6-gingerol treated mice when compared with AOM\/DSS treated mice colon. Also, using system biology analysis, we observed a high binding energy of 6-gingerol with PD-1\/PD-L1 Complex, PD-L1, Dimeric PD-L1 and CTLA-4\/B7-2 complex proteins. The result obtained from this study showed that 6-gingerol inhibited immune check point proteins and upregulated CD8+ T cells function in colorectal cancer via modulation of PD-1\/PD-L1 and CTLA4 receptor signaling, and as such 6-gingerol could be a promising natural product for CRC immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dc922295-3f65-459b-84a6-103578e5cddb\/@B03B8ZFZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Colorectal cancer,PD-L1,6-gingerol,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16835"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Babajide O.
