[{"Abstract":"<b>Purpose:<\/b> Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) may result in tumor response patterns that differ from efficacy measures of directly cytotoxic chemotherapies. Hence, the selection of patients for experimental ICI schedules, for instance in MSS-mCRC, calls for applicable and reliable signals of activity or early failure that enable treatment adaptation and maintain patient safety.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures:<\/b> In the ongoing METIMMOX phase 2 study, we hypothesize that patients with previously untreated unresectable MSS-mCRC can obtain durable disease control to ICI when given short-course oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (2 cycles of FLOX Q2W) before 2 cycles of nivolumab (240 mg Q2W) in a repeat sequential schedule to a total of 8 cycles. Patients have been randomly assigned to either this experimental study arm or a control arm of 8 FLOX cycles Q2W (standard-of-care; SoC), in both cases before treatment break until disease progression and reintroduction of a new treatment sequence. Radiologic response assessment is performed every 8 weeks with progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary end point.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> At analysis 10 November 2021, median PFS was 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.3-10.3) for SoC (<i>n<\/i> = 34) and 11.4 months (95% CI, 7.4-15.5) for the experimental therapy (<i>n<\/i> = 39) (<i>p<\/i> = 0.335; log-rank test). In the latter group, 37 patients had available response evaluation at minimum 8 weeks of study treatment, as 2 patients (compared to 4 in the control group) had discontinued treatment due to intolerable toxicity before the first post-baseline assessment. The control arm patients had deeper responses with mean 23% (SD, 19%) target lesion reduction compared to mean 8%(SD, 33%) reduction for the experimental schedule (<i>p<\/i> = 0.028; Student&#8217;s <i>t<\/i>-test). We categorized the experimental arm patients into those with &#8805;10% (<i>n<\/i> = 20) or &#60;10% (<i>n<\/i> = 17) target lesion reduction at 8 weeks. Median PFS for the &#8805;10% group was 15.2 months (95% CI, 11.4-19.0) and for the &#60;10% group 4.5 months (95% CI, 3.2-5.7), which was clearly superior and inferior to the control arm PFS (<i>p <\/i>= 0.007 for the &#8805;10% group and<i> p<\/i> = 0.019 for the &#60;10% group; log-rank test). Categorisation of experimental arm patients set at higher than 10% target lesion change at the first radiologic response assessment did not identify patients with longer PFS.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> While the SoC first-line chemotherapy resulted in deeper early responses, target lesion reduction of &#8805;10% at 8 weeks identified MSS-mCRC patients who held ICI responsiveness evoked by short-course oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, with significantly improved PFS compared to the SoC. An early radiologic signal of clinical activity may guide the selection of patients to the safe continuation of investigational ICI schedules; however, we do not know if adopting it may compromise prognosis for patients with early ICI failure who can proceed with SoC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17777a81-2b44-4240-b4d1-4a1044a70546\/@u03B8ZBZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Immunotherapy,Imaging,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16621"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sebastian Meltzer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Negård<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanne Mari Hamre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Kersten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Hofsli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianne Grønlie Guren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Halfdan Sørbye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kjersti Flatmark<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Hansen Ree<\/i><\/presenter>.

The greatest benefit has been observed in patients who have mutations in <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> or related genes in the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway. Nonetheless, responses to PARPi were not durable, indicating that strategies to prevent recurrence and overcome resistance, such as combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), are of high priority. However, most studies on PARPi have focused on the tumor itself and synthetic lethality. The immunological effect, particularly the effect on adaptive immune response, has been overlooked. PARP is expressed in almost all cells, and it regulates the transcription of various genes through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Therefore, we hypothesized that PARPi affect the composition and functions of T cells in the maintenance therapy setting, and consequently reconstitute the anti-tumor immune response in ovarian cancer. Here, we collected serial peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PARPi-treated patients and analyzed their dynamic immunologic changes using muticolor flow cytometry. The PBMCs were collected during PARPi maintenance therapy, and the time points included pre-treatment as well as 1 month and 3 months after the initiation of treatment. Olaparib or niraparib was used as maintenance therapy. First, the percentages of CD4, CD8, and FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup>regulatory T cells (Treg cells) were compared at each time point and by PARPi type. Interestingly, the proportion of Treg cells increased at 1 and 3 months after initiation, especially in the niraparib group. However, there were no significant changes in the proportion of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Second, we analyzed immune checkpoints and properties in each T cell population. We found that the PD-1 expression on Treg cells decreased after 1 and 3 months. Although the percentage of Treg cells increased, proliferative Ki-67<sup>+<\/sup>Treg cells decreased after 1 and 3 months, especially in the niraparib group. Third, intracellular staining assay was performed to measure functional changes of T cells during PARPi treatment. IFN-&#947; and\/or TNF-&#945; producing CD8 and CD4 T cells decreased after 1 month compared to pre-treatment. Finally, proliferative Ki-67<sup>+<\/sup>CD8 T cells and PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD8 T cells decreased after 72 hours of <i>in vitro<\/i> olaparib treatment compared to the control group. In conclusion, long-term PAPRi treatment may affect Treg cells and CD8 T cells. However, strategies to overcome negative effects of PARPi and their detailed mechanisms need to be further investigated. Additional data in this regard will be presented at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ba9e0802-1a21-4a8f-b402-606e9d7df045\/@u03B8ZBZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,T lymphocytes,Regulatory T cells,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16622"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Junsik Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miran Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yup Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoo-Na Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong-Jae Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung-Yun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

This vedotin drug linker system has been clinically validated by multiple ADC programs, including brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, tisotumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin. B7-H4 is an immune checkpoint ligand with elevated expression on a variety of solid tumor types, including breast, ovarian, and endometrial tumors. SGN-B7H4V is designed to bind and internalize the B7-H4\/ADC complex from the surface of malignant cells and release the cytotoxic payload MMAE. The antitumor activity of SGN-B7H4V may be multimodal as SGN-B7H4V can induce tumor cell death through several mechanisms, including MMAE-mediated direct cytotoxicity and bystander killing as well as antibody-mediated functions including<b> <\/b>antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP). Previously, vedotin ADCs have been described to elicit antitumor immune responses in part through induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) mediated by the MMAE payload. These immunomodulatory effects potentially position vedotin ADCs to uniquely synergize with checkpoint inhibitors, supported by recent clinical activity observed when vedotin ADCs are paired with anti-PD1 agents. Here, we characterize SGN&#8209;B7H4V-mediated ICD and subsequent immunomodulatory activity. We also evaluate the contribution of SGN-B7H4V-induced immune activation to antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD1 agent in an immunocompetent mouse model. In vitro, tumor cells treated with SGN-B7H4V showed several hallmarks of immunogenic cell death, including calreticulin exposure and release of ATP. In vivo, treatment of B7-H4-expressing tumors with SGN-B7H4V led to immune changes in the tumor microenvironment, including recruitment of macrophages and T cells. Finally, SGN-B7H4V drove robust, curative activity in an immunocompetent tumor model as a monotherapy and paired well with an anti-PD1 agent. Altogether, these data support the evaluation of SGN-B7H4V as a monotherapy in a first-in-human phase 1 clinical study and potential future clinical combinations with immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a613c795-c000-431f-bf59-6e2511784360\/@u03B8ZBZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Breast cancer,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16623"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"a2211339-8d43-4d2a-b79e-ede5f529a34a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a2211339-8d43-4d2a-b79e-ede5f529a34a\/@u03B8ZBZ\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth E.

However, 40% of patients do not have a clinical benefit of BCG. The presence of immune cells, their functional state, as well as genomic alterations in the tumor and the normal appearing urothelial tissue, defined as field effect, may have significant impact on therapeutic outcome.<br \/><b>Materials and methods:<\/b> To investigate this, we analyzed samples from 156 patients diagnosed with NMIBC, including 237 tumors, 569 urine samples, and 305 biopsies of adjacent normal appearing urothelium. Patients had a median follow-up time of 8 years. 70 patients (45%) progressed to muscle-invasive bladder cancer or experienced early high grade recurrence within two years after ended BCG treatment, defined as BCG failure. Urinary levels of 92 immune-oncology related proteins were measured in pre- and post-treatment samples using the Olink proteomics platform. Total RNA- and whole exome sequencing (WES) data was generated from tumors before and after BCG. Clonal patient-specific mutations were selected for deep-targeted sequencing of the adjacent normal appearing biopsies. The level of field effect was defined as the mean of the variant allele frequency for mutations observed in normal biopsies.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found that treatment with BCG activated the immune system regardless of clinical outcome. However, patients differed in urinary protein profile after BCG depending on their clinical response. Transcriptomic analysis of tumors showed that UROMOL2021 subtypes were significantly associated with outcome and clinical response (<i>p<\/i>=0.018). Paired tumors showed a shift in subtype to an immune infiltrated subtype (class 2b) after treatment in 36% of cases. Patients with BCG failure showed signs of immune exhaustion after treatment indicated by higher expression of the T cell exhaustion marker genes <i>CTLA4<\/i> (<i>p<\/i>=0.0067), <i>LAG3<\/i> (<i>p<\/i>=0.00012), <i>TIM-3<\/i> (<i>p<\/i>=0.022), <i>KLRG1<\/i> (<i>p<\/i>=0.028), and <i>PD-1<\/i> (<i>p<\/i>=0.047), and higher immune cell infiltration (<i>p<\/i>=0.011). Genomic features such as mutational signatures and mutational load were not predictive of clinical response. Interestingly, BCG-responsive patients had a high level of field effect before BCG (<i>p<\/i>=0.0026), suggesting that field effect could lead to increased BCG efficacy.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> BCG treatment was associated with immune system activation reflected in both urine and tissue samples. In patients with BCG failure, we observed an immune exhausted phenotype after treatment, and we observed a high level of field effect before treatment in responsive patients. Collectively, this could indicate that increased immunogenicity and prolonged immune activation are key factors in BCG treatment responsiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/53857e8e-2789-46cf-8fba-395948bffff9\/@u03B8ZBZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16624"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Trine Strandgaard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iver Nordentoft<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emil Christensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sia Lindskrog<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Lamy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karin Birkenkamp-Demtröder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Torben Steiniche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jørgen Bjerggaard Jensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Dyrskjøt<\/i><\/presenter>.

In situ destruction of tumor mass has been reported to provide the immune system with an antigen source for the induction of antitumor immunity, which can then attack distant metastases. Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a signaling molecule in multiple disease states, including cancer. NO has been shown to activate innate and adaptive responses of the immune system against tumors. In a previous Beyond Air study, 89% of CT26 tumor bearing mice treated with 50,000 parts per million (ppm) gaseous NO (gNO), rejected a secondary tumor induction. Here, we assessed the effects of a single intra-tumoral injection of gNO at concentrations of 20,000-50,000 ppm on immune cell recruitment in the tumor, spleen, and blood.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Mouse colon carcinoma (CT26) tumor bearing Balb\/c mice underwent a single intra-tumoral treatment with 20,000 (n=3) or 50,000 (n=4) ppm gNO for 5 minutes. Mice treated with N<sub>2<\/sub> (n=3), under the same conditions, served as a control. Tumors were removed 14 days post treatment and were histologically analyzed to test for immune cell penetration, inflammation, and necrosis. Immune cells from the spleen and blood were harvested 21 days post treatment and assessed via flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>1. Treatment with 50,000 ppm gNO resulted in higher levels of inflammation, lymphocytes and T-cell infiltration, and necrosis within the tumor compared to both N<sub>2<\/sub> and 20,000 ppm NO, as viewed histologically. 2. Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells from the spleen revealed a 1.3-fold increase of both B cells and IFN-&#947; expressing T cells with 50,000 NO treatment, and a 1.3-fold increase of B cells and 1.1-fold increase of IFN-&#947; expressing T cells with 20,000 NO treatment, compared to N<sub>2<\/sub>. 3. A 29% reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) was detected in spleens of mice treated with 50,000 ppm gNO, and 40% for 20,000 ppm, compared to mice treated with N<sub>2<\/sub>.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Intra-tumoral injection of ultra-high doses of NO at 20,000 and 50,000 ppm gNO led to an increased recruitment and concentration of T and B cells. Additionally, 50,000 ppm NO led to an increase of lymphocyte infiltration to the tumor. Taken together, the data suggest that the increase in lymphocyte infiltration, B and T cell population, and the reduction of MDSCs, are indicative of an adaptive immune response that results in rejection of secondary tumors in gNO-treated mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bf371ed0-73aa-4e47-b19c-82a76417fd88\/@v03B8ZC1\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nitric oxide,Immune response,T cell,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16625"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hila Confino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matan Goldshtein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yakir Levi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lidor Malka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amir Avniel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steve Lisi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ido Wolf<\/i><\/presenter>.

Elucidating resistance mechanisms to these different treatments is pivotal to propose new predictive biomarkers and to develop therapeutic strategies to improve ICI efficiency. We hypothesized that resistance to DDA and ICIs is mediated in part by intrinsic tumor mechanisms, some of which may be shared.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>To address this knowledge gap, we compared RNA expression signatures, antigen presentation, and PD-L1 expression from cohorts of cancer patients treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy to identify shared molecular pathways that may mediate cross-resistance. Using a panel of lung cancer cell lines, we then confirmed that the tumor-cell-intrinsic expression of SQSTM1 is positively correlated with antigen presentation, and inversely with DNA damage repair and DDA\/ICIs resistance gene signatures. This SQSTM1\/HERV pathway was then supported <i>in vitro<\/i> using engineered silenced cell-lines (SQSTM1, MAVS, and STING ShRNA) treated with FDA-approved DDA (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, and ionizing radiations) or synthetic double-stranded RNA (5&#8217;ppp dsRNAs and poly IC).<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Through three complementary approaches (<i>in silico<\/i>, <i>ex vivo<\/i> on patient cohorts, and <i>in vitro<\/i>), we identify the p62\/SQSTM1 scaffold protein as a key molecular mediator able of predicting and controlling sensitivity for DDA and ICIs. Mechanistically, in response to DNA damage, we found that SQSTM1 is essential for the inhibition of DNA repair and the reactivation of human endogenous retroviruses (hERV). Analogous to a &#8220;viral alarm&#8221;, the hERV are sensed and activate IFN responses that drive the expression of MHC-I and PD-L1, leading to tumor immune evasion. Targeting the hERV pathways in SQSTM1-depleted tumor cells by poly(I:C)\/Lyovec, or docetaxel treatment can rescue the hERV, IFN, and MHC pathway, providing a promising therapeutic avenue turning a &#8220;cold&#8221; into a &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor in non-responders cancer patients.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>Depending on its levels, we thus propose SQSTM1 as a predictive biomarker for guiding treatment decisions from i) ICI alone, ii) ICI combined with cisplatin, or; iii) ICI combined with poly(I:C)\/Lyovec or docetaxel, with the aim to increase immunotherapy efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/78448330-436e-4eb9-9d5c-451602cc8f7f\/@v03B8ZC1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Chemotherapy,Human endogenous retroviruses,SQSTM1 predictive biomarker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16626"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Iris Grosjean<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grégoire D’Andréa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathalie Yazbeck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amine Belaid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barnabé Roméo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Angela Domdom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Guillot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Gilson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emmanuel Chamorey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gérard Milano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Véronique Hofman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marius Ilié<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle Benard-Thiery<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Heeke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Brest<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>François Ghiringhelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Hofman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Baharia Mograbi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Overexpression of PD-L1 on cancer cells is associated with poor clinical outcomes in many types of cancers. PD-L1 upregulation contributes to chemoresistance in several types of cancer, but little is known about the mechanisms for alterations in PD-L1 expression associated with chemotherapy, especially in patients with CRC. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying changes in PD-L1 levels in response to standard of care chemotherapeutics in CRC is important. In this study, we examined the effects of thechemotherapeutics that are approved for the treatment of patients with CRC (oxaliplatin, 5FU, and irinotecan whose metabolite is SN38) in inducing PD-L1 expression and determining the molecular pathwaysinvolved in PD-L1 regulation.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: PD-L1 expression in CRC cell lines was determined in vitro using western blotting and FACS analysis. Changes in PD-L1 transcript levels were measured using real time PCR. RPPA analyses were performed to identify proteins\/pathways affected by chemotherapeutics. Pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs were used to target specific proteins in determining their role in PD-L1 expression.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We observed that oxaliplatin, 5FU, and SN38, resulted in induction of PD-L1 to various degrees. Interestingly this induction was observed in KRAS or BRAF mutated CRC cells but not in CRC cells with wild-type KRAS and BRAF. Increased levels of PD-L1 were due to increased transcription of PD-L1 resulting from exposure to chemotherapeutics. Chemotherapeutics lead to the activation of the DNA damage signaling mediator Chk1 and the downstream transcription activator NF-&#954;Bp65. Inhibition of Chk1 or NF-&#954;Bp65 resulted in abrogated PD-L1 induction in response to chemotherapeutic treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>PD-L1 can be induced following treatment with chemotherapy in CRC cells harboring mutations in BRAF or KRAS. Our findings provide a rationale for studies combining inhibitors of NF-&#954;Bp65 with standard of care chemotherapeutics in CRC to block PD-L1 expression and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy damaged-tumor cell clearance by innate immunity that, in turn, should improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0c1ae104-0e3e-4efb-a2c7-4816d90d089f\/@v03B8ZC1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Chemotherapy,PD-L1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16627"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Fan Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susmita Ghosh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee Ellis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Rajat Bhattacharya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In particular, doxorubicin (DOX), one of the chemo-drugs, is well known to induce ICD, which involves the activation of the immune system against cancer in immunocompetent hosts. ICD comprises the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying tumor cells that result in the activation of tumor-specific immune responses, thus eliciting long-term efficacy of anticancer drugs by combining direct cancer cell killing and antitumor immunity. However, the antitumor immunity can be achieved by overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Most current treatment strategies harnessing the tumor microenvironment focus on T cell-immune response, either by promoting activating signals or suppressing inhibitory ones.We here present a novel approach to cope with the inhibitory TME, combinatory treatment of DOX with poly gamma glutamic acid (&#947;-PGA). PGA, a safe edible biomaterial secreted by <i>B. subtillis<\/i>, has been evaluated in the clinical trials with the patients diagnosed as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN 1). From the study using murine cancer models, including MC38, we found the combinatory treatment with &#947;-PGA restored the downregulation of NK cell activity caused by DOX, enhanced ICD and T cell responses, and reduced proinflammatory cytokines in the tumor tissues. Taken together, co-administration of &#947;-PGA exhibited synergistic anti-cancer effects by favoring the immunosuppressive TME in the combinatory treatment with conventional chemo-drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13968b8e-6d46-44d8-affc-b4b867f15a9f\/@v03B8ZC1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immunogenic cell death,Tumor microenvironment,Poly gamma glutamic acid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16628"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joungwoo Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Solmin Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yena Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaepyeong Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeondong Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Do young Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngcheol Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kwangil Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>.

In <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments, combined olaparib-mediated PARP inhibition and ADU-S100-mediated STING agonism induced a greater degree of STING pathway activation and proinflammatory cytokine production compared to monotherapies in BRCA1-deficient human MDA-MB-436 cells and mouse triple-negative breast cancer cell lines derived from a genetically engineered model of BRCA-deficient breast cancer. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments were conducted in mice bearing completely established tumors derived from the genetically engineered mouse model expanded syngeneically. In this model, the combination also induced an improved immune response compared to either monotherapy alone, evidenced by a greater degree of cytotoxic T cell recruitment and activation, and enhanced dendritic cell activation and antigen presentation. Nanostring mRNA analysis indicated that combinatorial effects were the result of augmented interferon signaling and antigen processing, as well as heightened leukocyte and dendritic cell functions. The combination markedly improved anti-tumor efficacy <i>in vivo <\/i>compared to monotherapy treatment, with evidence of complete tumor clearance and prolongation of survival. Finally, in mice treated with the combination, tumors could not be re-established upon rechallenge, indicating the induction of immunologic memory. These results support the development of combined PARP inhibition and STING agonism in <i>BRCA<\/i>-associated breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a1540e04-8135-45b7-b297-06df67ce238d\/@v03B8ZC1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,T cell,Breast cancer,BRCA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16630"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Heta Jadhav<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Constantia Pantelidou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aditi Kothari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renyan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerburg Wulf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer L.

These radionuclides have a natural affinity for areas of bone metastases (i.e., radium-223, Ra-223) or can label specific tumour targets (i.e., prostate-specific membrane antigen). Conventional photon irradiation (i.e., external beam) can activate or suppress immune responses. The resulting immune response is dictated by the release of soluble markers such as cytokines (i.e., IL-6) and damage associated molecular patterns, DAMPs (calreticulin). Less is known about the immune response induced by alpha-emitters. With increased interest in using TAT for cancer patients, it is important to gain a more in depth knowledge regarding the immune response of alpha emitters.<br \/>Aim: Explore the systemic immune response of prostate cancer (PCa) patients to alpha-emitting RT by studying circulating cytokines, checkpoint molecules, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and DAMPs. Methods: The cohort comprised of 43 patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCa treated with up to six four-weekly injections of the alpha emitter, Ra-223. We measured longitudinal changes in 61 plasma markers using the Luminex assay. The plasma markers included cytokines, checkpoint molecules and DAMPs.<br \/>Results: Ra-223 induced longitudinal changes in 14 plasma markers over the course of treatment (T2-T6) compared with pre-treatment levels (T1). Most of the observed RT-induced changes occurred after four injections of Ra-223 (T5), where 9 of the 14 plasma markers changed significantly. The table summarises T5 findings (presented as mean concentration, pg\/ml; statistical analysis using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test).<br \/>Conclusion: Our data demonstrates that alpha-emitting RT induces systemic immune responses that can be measured in the plasma of patients. Given the diverse role of these markers, further study is needed to explore the biological implications of these systemic changes on patient outcome.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{8730871D-626F-41EE-ABC7-84473A8A9C0F}\"><caption>Changes in plasma markers in patients treated with Ra-223<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">T1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">T5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P value<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IL-8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.7±0.9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.7±1.3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0009<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IL-2R<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">293.5±42.9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">364.5±69.7<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0247<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IP-10<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18.4±2.3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21.8±2.5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0243<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RANTES<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2668.8±173.4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2944.7±164.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0455<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BTLA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">549.9±153.5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">527.7±265.2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0319<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CD137<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">49.6±8.9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">39.1±13.5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0099<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Calreticulin<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7868±3514.9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9238.4±808.5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0386<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RAGE<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">63.9±4.7<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">52.3±5.1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MMP1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">66.1±7.5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">84.9±12.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0245<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/830f5ba8-2842-43ee-9db4-246fe15bf9fc\/@v03B8ZC1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Immune response,Alpha-emitting radionuclides,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16632"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sapna Lunj<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hitesh Mistry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>YeePei Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kamlesh Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannah Nightingale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Hoskin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catharine West<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ananya Choudhury<\/i><\/presenter>.
