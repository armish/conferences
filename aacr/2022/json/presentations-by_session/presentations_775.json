[{"Abstract":"Background: 4-Demethyl-4-cholesteryloxycarbonylpenclomedine (DM-CHOC-PEN) is a poly-chlorinated pyridine cholesteryl carbonate that was designed to penetrate the blood brain barrier and be useful as therapy for brain tumors (IND 68,876). A 3-stage mechanism is proposed for drug entry into the CNS and into cancer cells <i>via<\/i> reversible binding with sialic acid on the surface of RBC&#8217;s; and transported into cancer cells with L-glutamine. DM-CHOC-PEN has a MOA <i>via<\/i> <i>bis<\/i>-alkylation of DNA @ N<sup>7<\/sup>-guanine and N<sup>4<\/sup>-cytosine. DM-CHOC-PEN has completed clinical trials involving sixty-four (64) adults and nineteen (19) adolescent\/young adult subjects with advanced cancers. Long term survival, good qualities of life and minimal toxicities [AACR #1185, 2013; AACR #CT 129, 2019; AACR #CT152, 2021] have been reported. This update provides affirmation that the drug, previously described as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involving the CNS, is well tolerated with continued durations of responses, no new toxicities, good survival and good quality of life. Primary aims of the previously reported DM-CHOC-PEN clinical trials were to assess clinical response and monitor toxicities\/safety and verify the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) for the drug administered IV to subjects with cancer. Here is an update on the long term responses, tolerance and quality of survival in subjects with NSCLC involving the CNS.<br \/>Subjects &#38; Methods: DM-CHOC-PEN was administered to adults (<u>&#62;<\/u> 18 y\/o) with NSCLC involving the CNS that lacked genetic rearrangements or tumor targets and\/or had failed standard therapies as a 3-hr IV infusion once every 21 days employing a verified 2-tiered MTD schedule: 85.8 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> for subjects with liver involvement and 98.7 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> for subjects with normal livers.<br \/>Results: Sixteen (16) adult subjects with NSCLC have been treated to date, which 11 had NSCLC (adeno\/large cell carcinomas) involving the CNS that lacked genetic rearrangements, had no tumor targets, and\/or had failed standard therapies. Seven of the 11 subjects with NSCLC involving the CNS also possessed cerebellar metastases. The drug was well tolerated with no Gr-3 toxicities. The most common Gr-2 adverse effects were reversible fatigue (17%), reversible vasogenic edema (9%) and nausea (9%). No drug associated neuro\/psychological, hematological, cardiac or renal toxicities have been observed, nor have there been any drug associated deaths reported. The pK modelling and properties for the drug have been previously reported [AACR #1185, 2013] and continue to be confirmed. Eight (8) subjects with NSCLC involving the CNS responded to DM-CHOC-PEN with documented CR\/PR (RECIST 1.1) and improved OS\/QOL\/PFS (Kaplan-Meier) lasting 8 - 82+ mos. with survivals of 25% at 34 mos., 50% at 10 mos. and 8% at 84+ mos.<br \/>Conclusion: DM-CHOC-PEN is a <i>bis<\/i>-alkylator of DNA that is safe at the dose levels described and has produced long term objective responses with manageable toxicities and improved quality of life in subjects with NSCLC involving the CNS lacking genetic rearrangements or tumor targets and\/or had failed standard therapies. Complete data on subject responses and observed toxicities will be presented.

T+ prostate cancer cells depend on exogenous androgen; Tp cells express CYP17A1, produce and depend on androgen; and T- cells are androgen-independent and abiraterone (abi)-resistant. We applied this model to guide the on and off treatment cycles with abi for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). At the first interim analysis with 11 patients, this approach was shown to prolong the time to cancer progression with less than 50% drug usage compared to the conventional continuous abi (Nat Commun. 2017). Here we present the updated data of this phase 2a study with a median follow up of 5.8 years.<br \/>Methods: Men with asymptomatic or minimal symptomatic mCRPC were enrolled after they achieved &#62; 50% PSA reduction with abi as a frontline therapy for mCRPC. The primary objective is feasibility and is measured by the percentage of abi responsive men who remain to be responsive to abi (defined as &#62; 50% decline of the pre Abi PSA) after completing 2 adaptive treatment cycles. The secondary objective is to assess the clinical benefits by comparing the radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) in men undergoing adaptive Abi therapy to a contemporaneous cohort of patients who met trial eligibility but received continuous abi dosing as standard of care (SOC). Computer simulations of each patient&#8217;s clinical course estimated critical evolutionary parameters and then tested alternative strategies for individuals in both cohorts.<br \/>Result: 17 evaluable patients were enrolled at Moffitt Cancer Center between June 2015 and January 2019. 5 of the 17 patients have completed at least 5 adaptive therapy cycles and 4 remain on study treatment without imaging progression for &#62; 52 months at the data cut off on 1\/4\/2022. The study is closed for enrollment after demonstrating the feasibility of adaptive therapy. 16 SOC patients treated with continuous abi for mCRPC between 2015 and 2018 were identified through retrospective chart reviewed. Clinical features like Gleason score and metastasis burden are similar between the two groups. Evolution-based application of abiraterone significantly improved (p&#60;0.001) median rPFS (30.4 months) and median OS (58.5 months) in the adaptive group compared to the 14.3 months median rPFS and the 31.3 months median OS in the SOC group. Average cumulative dose in the adaptive cohort was 54% of SOC dosing.<br \/>Conclusions: Adaptive Abi therapy is feasible in men who responded to Abi as a frontline therapy for mCRPC. The updated data with longer follow up demonstrated OS as well as rPFS benefits of our adaptive therapy approach with less drug usage compared to the conventional continuous Abi.<br \/>Clinical trial information: NCT02415621","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0399f77a-84b7-4ccf-a1fe-fe2181a5712a\/@s03B8ZYr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen deprivation therapy,Prostate cancer,Modeling,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20255"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jingsong Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joel S.

However, cancer screening rates among Chinese- and Korean Americans are lower than other racial\/ ethnic groups in the United States. To address this disparity, we tested the effectiveness of a culturally adapted decision support navigation trial.<br \/>Methods: The STOP CRC (<u>S<\/u>creening <u>TO<\/u> <u>P<\/u>revent CRC) program, a cluster randomized controlled trial, recruited 24 Chinese and Korean primary care physicians (PCP) from Maryland and northern Virginia. Then, 400 Chinese and Korean Americans were recruited through the PCPs&#8217; clinics. Participants randomized to a decision support navigation intervention group (n=200) received an informational booklet, instructions to access colonoscopy screening, and a free fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kit at baseline. A bilingual patient navigator also guided them through an exercise to facilitate screening test choices. Six months after enrollment, participants randomized to the control group (n=200) received the informational booklet, colonoscopy instructions, and a FIT kit. Participants selected a method of CRC screening between the FIT or colonoscopy. Screening (completion of FIT or colonoscopy) was measured at 6 and 12 months after enrollment by medical record review and self-report. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models with an exchangeable working correlation matrix to account for clustering effects at the PCP level were employed to examine intervention effects on CRC screening outcomes.<br \/>Results: Intervention and control participants were comparable on socio-demographic background and access to healthcare at baseline. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and 53% of participants were female. The majority of participants (85%) were married, 34% had less than or equal to high school education, 32% had annual household income less than $40,000, and 21% did not have health insurance. At 6 months, screening adherence in the intervention group was (91%) predominantly greater than in the control group (8%) (Prevalence Ratio: 11.31, 95% confidence interval: 6.95-18.43). At 12 months, although the gap between the two groups was reduced, the screening adherence in the intervention group was (93%) still substantially higher than in the control group (63%) (Prevalence Ratio: 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.37-1.66).<br \/>Conclusions: The STOP CRC program, a culturally and linguistically adapted decision support navigation intervention, is effective in increasing CRC screening among Chinese and Korean American primary care patients who are not up-to-date with the screening. This program can potentially be adapted and implemented for other Asian Americans who are not up-to-date with the CRC screening in the U.S.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8697d80c-fb57-4072-b9d1-3c21887da9bd\/@s03B8ZYr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,Chinese and Korean Americans,Colorectal Cancer Screening,Randomized Controlled Trial,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20260"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sunmin Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soomin Ryu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carissa Kwan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald E.

Cemiplimab provided substantial clinical benefit and an acceptable safety profile in patients with laBCC who discontinued HHI therapy due to progressive disease (PD), intolerance, or no better than stable disease (SD) after 9 months (NCT03132636). Here, we present the primary analysis of the mBCC cohort.<br \/>Methods: Patients with mBCC (nodal or distant) post-HHI treatment received cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 93 weeks or until PD. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review (ICR). Key secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability, ORR per investigator (INV) assessment, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and complete response (CR) rate (data cutoff date: May 20, 2021).<br \/>Results: Fifty-four patients were enrolled (70.4% male; median age 63.5 years [range, 38&#8722;90]; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 [66.7%] and 1 [33.3%]). Median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months (range 1.5-36.2). ORR per ICR was 24.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.5-37.6); with 1 CR and 12 partial responses (PRs). ORR per INV was 25.9% (95% CI, 15.0-39.7), with 2 CRs and 12 PRs. Among responders, median time to response per ICR was 4.0 months (range, 2.0&#8722;10.5). Estimated median DOR per ICR was 16.7 months (95% CI, 9.8-not evaluable). Disease control rate was 63.0% (95% CI, 48.7-75.7) per ICR and 70.4% (95% CI, 56.4-82.0) per INV. Median OS was not reached. Median PFS per ICR was 8.3 months (95% CI, 4.2-15.9). The most common treatment&#8209;related adverse events were fatigue (37.0%), diarrhea (14.8%), pruritus (13.0%), hyperthyroidism (9.3%), and arthralgia (9.3%) as well as hypothyroidism, asthenia, constipation, and maculo-papular rash (7.4% each).

Treatment schedule consisted in four primary cycles of inverted dose ipilimumab 1 mg\/kg and nivolumab 3 mg\/kg every 3 weeks, followed by radical surgery and adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. Primary objective was pathological complete remission (pCR) rate, according to International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium (INMC) criteria, while secondary objectives were: safety, feasibility and efficacy; QoL; identification of biomarkers of response and resistance; degree of immune activation; longitudinal evaluation of the gut microbiome. From March 2019 to April 2021, 43 pts were enrolled in the trial and, with an intent to treat of 35 pts, 34 completed the primary phase, 31 received surgery and 28 completed the adjuvant phase. Four pts were withdrawn during primary phase for progression (2), toxicity (1) and consent withdrawal (1). Study primary endpoint has been met since 20\/31 pts undergoing surgery reached a pCR\/near pCR (65%), 4\/31 (13%) a pathological partial remission (pPR) and 7\/31 (22%) pts a pathological no response. With a median follow-up of 17 months, 33\/35 pts are alive. Treatment failure occurred in 9 pts: 2 pts progressed during primary phase and did not undergo surgery; 7 pts progressed during adjuvant (3 pts) or follow-up phase (4 pts). Six out of these 7 pts were classified as pNR at surgery, while the other, classified as pCR, did not receive adjuvant therapy. Both pts in stage IV relapsed. Unfortunately, one pt died for ischemic stroke after 5 months from adjuvant therapy while on CR. Treatment related toxicities were mainly G1-2 and only 6 pts (17%) developed G3-4 adverse events (AE): 3 transaminitis, 1 pneumonitis, 1 myocarditis, 1 CPK increase and 1 dermatomyositis. Translational studies on samples collected before, during therapy and at progression have been performed: whole exome sequencing and gut microbiota dynamics on longitudinal samples showed some relationships with responses and developing resistances. These data, never presented elsewhere previously, are in part new and in part confirmatory of immunological or molecular signatures described by other groups. In conclusion, primary immunotherapy with Ipilimumab\/Nivolumab in pts affected by locally advanced\/oligometastatic melanoma is able to achieve an elevated pCR\/near pCR rate which appears to be predictive of long term relapse free survival. Translational data analyzed longitudinally on each patient can allow for a better selection of pts, giving new insight on the mechanisms of melanoma progression and resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c12ff407-7854-43c3-9397-495f26306560\/@t03B8ZYs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,neoadjuvant immunoterapy,ipilimumab\/nivolumab,biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20263"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pier Francesco Ferrucci<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruno Achutti Duso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luigi Nezi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Mazzarella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fiorenza Lotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Gandini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianmarco Orsolini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabetta Pennacchioli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrizia Gnagnarella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa Manzo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Ribero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Teresa Fierro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Senetta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Concetta Riviello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virginia Caliendo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pietro Quaglino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massino Barberis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuseppina Bonizzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilia Cocorocchio<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cediranib (C) and sunitinib (S) are potent oral inhibitors of all 3 VEGF receptors. Cediranib showed substantial single-agent activity (objective response rate [ORR] = 35%) in our previous trial in patients (pts) with metastatic ASPS (NCT00942877). Here we report a phase 2 randomized multicenter trial of single agent C or S in pts with ASPS (NCT01391962).<br \/>Methods: We conducted a multicenter phase 2 trial with an optimal 2-stage design targeting an ORR of 40%. Enrolled pts were &#62;16 years with metastatic ASPS, previously not treated (N) and unresectable, or previously treated (T), who have progressed per RECIST 1 within the 6-month period preceding enrollment. Pts were randomized to receive C (30 mg) or S (37.5 mg) orally, once a day, in 28-day cycles and could crossover to the other treatment arm at disease progression. ORR (primary endpoint), median progression-free survival (mPFS), and PFS rate at 24 weeks for the 2 arms (C and S) were evaluated; T and N cohorts were assessed separately in each arm. Arm accrual closed if &#8804; 1 of the first 10 enrolled pts responded to the first treatment.<br \/>Results: Thirty-four pts (47% white, 29.4% black, 17.6% Asian, 5.8% Pacific Islander) were enrolled; 29 pts were evaluable for response. One pt on each of the initial treatment arms had a confirmed partial response (PR), rates of 6.7% (1\/154) and 7.1% (1\/14) for C and S tx or tx-naive, respectively. Among pts who crossed over, there was 1 PR in a pt receiving C after initially responding (PR) on S (1\/9; ORR 11.1%). Twenty-four pts had a best response of stable disease (86.7% and 78.6%) for C and S, respectively. The mPFS was 7.6 months (mo) (95% CI: 3.7-9.9 mo) and 5.5 mo (95% CI: 1.8-14.5 mo) for C and S, respectively administered as first therapy (p=0.92). PFS rate at 24 weeks was 62.5% (95% CI: 29.5-76.2%) and 50% (95% CI: 25.9-70.1%) for pts receiving C and S respectively, as initial therapy. There was no difference in mPFS between T or N pts in the C (6.7 mo [95% CI: 1.4-9.9 mo] vs 8.3 mo [95% CI: 2.7 - 16.6 mo]; P=0.35) arm, but some evidence of a potential difference in the S (4.8 mo [95% CI: 0.9-7.9 mo] vs 14.7 mo 95% CI: 1.8 - 21.6 mo]; P=0.058) arm. Overall, 43.7% (C) and 77.8% (S) of pts experienced grade &#8805;3 adverse events (AEs) at least possibly related to the study drug. Common grade &#8805;3 AEs included: diarrhea (C), neutropenia (S), hypertension (C and S). AEs were in line with the known safety profiles of each agent. As of August 2021, 1 pt (unevaluable for ORR) remains on study.<br \/>Conclusions: The study did not meet its endpoints for ORR. There were no differences in mPFS for the 2 treatment arms. The selection of pts with more aggressive disease, who had progressed in the 6 months prior to enrollment, may account for the low patient response rates compared to our previous study of cediranib in ASPS.<br \/>Funded by NCI Contract No. HHSN261200800001E.

In advanced gastric cancer, single agent ramucirumab is well tolerated and improves overall survival (OS) compared to placebo although it is largely cytostatic with a response rate &#8804;3%. Preclinical <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>experiments reveal that hypoxia induces homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in tumors, which may be exploited by the addition of inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARPi). We thus designed NCI10066 for metastatic gastric cancer with the hypothesis that ramucirumab would sensitize tumors to the PARPi olaparib.<br \/>Methods: NCI 10066 (NCT03008278) was a phase 1 \/ 2, multicenter, open-label clinical trial sponsored by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with measurable disease refractory to &#8805; 1 prior therapy that did not contain ramucirumab. Patients were treated with escalating doses of olaparib with ramucirumab 8 mg\/kg every 2 weeks in a 3+3 design. Dose escalation evaluated two dose levels: olaparib 200 mg twice daily with ramucirumab 8 mg\/kg every 2 weeks (dose level 1) and olaparib 300 mg twice daily with ramucirumab 8 mg\/kg every 2 weeks (dose level 2). The primary objective of dose escalation was to assess safety and measure dose limiting toxicities (DLT) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The primary objective in phase 2 was to evaluate clinical activity at the RP2D in a 40-patient expansion cohort.<br \/>Results: From 2\/8\/18 - 9\/17\/21, 51 patients were enrolled at 10 centers throughout the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network and 28\/51 (55%) patients had &#8805;2 prior lines of therapy. In dose escalation 3 patients were treated at dose level 1 and 8 at dose level 2. No DLTs were observed at dose level 1 and at dose level 2 there was 1 DLT (fatigue) in 6 evaluable patients. The RP2D was determined to be olaparib 300 mg twice daily and ramucirumab 8 mg\/kg every 2 weeks. Forty patients were treated in dose expansion at the RP2D. Of 46 patients evaluable for a response there were 5\/46 (11%) partial responses (PR) and the disease control rate (PR\/SD) was 29\/46 (63%) at 6 weeks. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 2.8 months (95% CI 2.3 - 4.2) and the median OS was 7.3 months (95% CI 5.6 - 13.0). Grade &#8805; 3 treatment related adverse events were seen in 13 (25%) of patients and there were no treatment related deaths.<br \/>Conclusions: The combination of olaparib and ramucirumab is well tolerated with a RP2D of olaparib 300 mg twice daily and ramucirumab 8 mg\/kg every 2 weeks. The ORR, PFS, and OS exceed the historical control with ramucirumab monotherapy, suggesting that the combination is clinically active. Biomarkers are critical to defining patient subsets more likely to benefit from the combination and HRD biomarker analysis is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d340693d-1146-42df-88e7-eb9a42b4960f\/@t03B8ZYs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,DNA repair,Homologous recombination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20266"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Cecchini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Chao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Shyr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Cleary<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nataliya Uboha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>May Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Shields<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shubham Pant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Goff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Spencer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edward Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Yuan Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stacey Stein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaykumar Thumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Kortmansky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Kunstman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia LoRusso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Percy Ivy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jill Lacy<\/i><\/presenter>.

Common adverse effects include fatigue, weight gain, sarcopenia, and decreased libido leading to lowered quality of life (QoL). Supervised exercise improves overall QoL among PCa patients. Less is known, however, how it may affect metabolic adverse effects of ADT.The aim of the study was to explore the effect of exercise intervention on glucose and cholesterol levels, body composition, and to find out whether supervised exercise leads to greater physical activity in long-term compared to self-administered exercise in men with ADT.<br \/>Materials and methods: Altogether, 45 men were recruited. One man withdrew the consent at baseline and 5 dropped out during the study. Thus, 39 men completed the study. Subjects were randomly assigned into either supervised exercise for 3 months (n=27) or control group of self-administered exercise (n=17). In the supervised group, participants attended 1.5-hour group exercise session twice per week. Training program included both aerobic and muscle strength exercises. The 3-month intervention was followed by 3-month follow-up of self-administered exercise. Control group received the same introduction to exercise and training instruction as the supervised group but exercised independently for the entire study period. Fasting cholesterol, plasma glucose, and body composition were evaluated at the baseline, 3 months after randomization, and at the end of the study, 6 months after randomization. Physical activity during the study period was measured using activity bracelets (Polar A370). Study protocol was approved by Pirkanmaa hospital ethics committee (R18021) and registered to Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04050397).<br \/>Results: Median total cholesterol increased during 6-month follow-up in both groups, but less in the supervised group compared to the control group (0.1 vs 0.4 mmol\/l, respectively, p=0.02). LDL remained stable in supervised group but increased slightly in the control group (0 vs. 0.4 mmol\/l, respectively, p=0.01). Fasting plasma glucose lowered slightly in both groups (-0.2 vs -0.4 mmol\/l). Total active time per day was slightly higher in the supervised group compared to the control group after 3-month intervention (median 364 vs 293 min\/day, respectively). This difference persisted after intervention stopped (median 331 vs 267 min\/day, respectively). Median change in body fat percentage at 6 months was 0 in the supervised arm and -0.9 in the control arm. None of the participants dropped out due to exercise-related side-effects.<br \/>Conclusion: This pilot study showed that it is safe to perform strength exercise in men with ADT. Supervised exercise is likely more effective in mitigating metabolic adverse effect of ADT and inducing long-term changes in physical activity than self-administered exercise. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to investigate whether this leads to survival advantage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a7f03811-4bed-4188-91e9-c5102c90d67e\/@t03B8ZYs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,lipid and glucose metabolism,Androgen deprivation therapy,physical exercise,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20267"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lauri Rantaniemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aino Siltari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eeva Harju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Teemu J.
