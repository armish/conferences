Transformed cells exhibit a perturbed oncogene-stimulated and ECM-tuned mechanophenotype that further stimulates ECM remodeling and stiffening. We have been exploring how these aberrant cell and tissue level forces arise and by what means these forces contribute to malignancy and metastasis, and how they promote tumor recurrence and treatment resistance. We use two and three dimensional culture models with tuned ECM stiffness, as well as transgenic and syngeneic mouse models, human PDX models and human biospecimens, in which ECM crosslinking and stiffness and integrin mechanosignaling are manipulated and quantified. Our work has thus far revealed that the tumor ECM is progressively remodeled, and stiffened, primarily by stromal fibroblasts. We determined that infiltrating pro-tumorigenic myeloid cells secrete factors that stimulate stromal fibroblasts to remodel and crosslink the ECM and that this occurs quite early during tumor evolution. The stromal-fibroblast stiffened ECM thereafter disrupts tissue organization, promotes cell growth and survival and drives cell invasion. The stiffened tumor stroma additionally drives angiogenesis, and activates STAT3 to increase expression of cytokines and chemokines that further stimulate immune cell infiltration. The stiffened ECM thereafter reprograms the infiltrating myeloid cells by altering integrin adhesions and TGF&#946; SMAD signaling to induce an ECM synthetic metabolic phenotype in the myeloid cells. The metabolically reprogrammed myeloid cells ultimately compromise arginine tissue availability and increase tissue levels of ornithine that severely disrupt CD8 T cell tissue infiltration and perturb their anti-tumor function to accelerate tumor aggression and metastatic dissemination. I will discuss the dynamic and reciprocal interplay between tissue tension and innate and acquired immunity. I will then present data to show how ECM stiffness is able to promote tumor aggression and metastasis by dysregulating anti-tumor immunity. I will end with a short discussion regarding approaches to design therapies informed by these results to improve cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,Macrophages,T cell,Stromal-epithelial interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Valerie M.

One prominent biophysical characteristic of cancer cells is their stiffness. At the early steps of the metastatic cascade, transformed cells become physically softer and this allows them to invade into and to navigate through the surrounding extracellular matrix. Conversely, cancer cells that later intravasate into circulation need to maintain a higher degree of biophysical stiffness in order to withstand shear forces that otherwise cause mechanical rupture of cancer cells during hematogenous dissemination. However, the impact of cellular stiffness on the final stage of metastatic colonization in vital secondary organs is not well understood. We recently found that increasing stiffness of disseminated cancer cells sensitizes them to destruction by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Specifically, we found that myocardin related transcription factor (MRTFA\/B) activity in cancer cells increases cancer cell stiffness, which then biophysically stimulates apoptotic cytokine production and cytolytic granule secretion in the adjoining CD8+ T- and Natural Killer (NK) cells for improved cytotoxicity. Our data highlighted the <i>in vivo<\/i> prevalence of the fundamental concepts in lymphocyte mechanobiology, which posit that increasing the stiffness of the surfaces that oppose T- and NK cells increases their cytolytic function through mechano-chemical signal transduction. We termed this mechanical mode of immune surveillance &#8220;<i>mechanosurveillance<\/i>&#8221; and showed that the expression of its molecular mediators cooperates with immune checkpoint blockade therapies in melanoma models and is associated with better patient survival in the clinic. In our current work, we utilized a series of novel biophysical approaches to measure the stiffness of metastatic foci <i>in situ<\/i> and to demonstrate that physically stiffer metastatic foci are eliminated by the immune surveillance. Furthermore, we used bioinformatics analyses of patient data and loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to identify therapeutically actionable proteins that increase cancer cell stiffness. Our findings revealed pharmacological manipulations that increase cancer cell stiffness and provided a road map for promoting mechanosurveillance in metastatic niches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Immune response,Mechanotransduction,Biophysics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ekrem Emrah Er<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In solid tumors featuring a prominent stromal reaction, an improved understanding of the functions and origins of abundant stromal cell types may facilitate the development of new and effective therapies. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the quintessence of a fibro-inflammatory malignancy, with 50-90% of tumor volume occupied by a dense, desmoplastic stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the key cell type which drives the stromal reaction in PDAC, and recent reports suggest that stromal CAFs represent a heterogeneous population of cells from diverse origins, potentially including cell types which support and others which suppress tumor growth. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are lipid-storing cells in healthy pancreas which can transdifferentiate to an activated CAF phenotype. PSCs have been suggested as the predominant source of fibroblasts in the PDAC tumor microenvironment. However, proper lineage tracing studies have never been performed, such that the relative contribution and specific functions of PSCs in the tumor microenvironment are unknown. We have developed a novel mouse model to track PSC differentiation and function during pancreatic tumor progression <i>in vivo<\/i>. This model revealed that PSC-derived CAFs in fact give rise to a numerically minor but functionally significant subset of PDAC CAFs, and may represent a viable therapeutic target. We adapted our mouse model to enable targeted ablation of PSCs and derivative CAFs within their host tissue for the first time. Functional studies in this model reveal non-redundant functions for PSC-derived CAFs in shaping the PDAC microenvironment, and highlight the significance of mesenchymal lineage heterogeneity for pancreatic tumorigenesis. Further, we find that tumor genotype with respect to p53 status dictates stromal evolutionary routes with respect to cell of origin, a finding that may extend to additional cancer cell-intrinsic genomic alterations. Together, these findings shed light on mechanisms that shape the tumor microenvironment during pancreatic cancer progression, and may hold relevance in additional solid tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Extracellular matrix,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mara H.
