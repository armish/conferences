[{"Abstract":"EGFR is a transmembrane protein that functions as a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Upon ligand binding or by activating mutations (Exon19 deletion, L858R mutation, and others), EGFR turns on the downstream signals that include oncogenic RAS\/MEK\/ERK, PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR, and JAK\/STAT pathways. EGFR gene mutations and amplifications are frequently found in various human cancers and, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the EGFR gene is mutated with 10-15% frequency (about 50% in Asian patients). While the 1<sup>st<\/sup> and 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation EGFR inhibitors are effective in targeting EGFR mutants with Exon19 deletion and L858R mutation, additional T790M mutation in the EGFR gene causes resistance. The 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation EGFR inhibitor (Osimertinib) works against EGFR mutants with T790M mutation; however, another EGFR mutation occurs at the amino acid 797 position (C797S), which makes Osimertinib ineffective. This is one of the major resistance mechanisms in Osimertinib-treated patients, and the 4<sup>th<\/sup> generation EGFR inhibitor that can target the C797S mutant is needed. We developed a compound that effectively disables various EGFR mutations, including Del19\/T790M\/C797S, L858R\/T790\/C797S, Del19\/C797S, and L858R\/C797S. In vitro kinase assay and cellular assays showed high potency and selectivity. In vivo PK\/PD and efficacy tests confirmed the great therapeutic potential of this inhibitor for patients with EGFR mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a8b73821-70d9-448f-9e08-37b96681c689\/@E03B8ZD6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),C979S,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15000"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dongsu Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woo Seung Son<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeri Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donggeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Changyu Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyung Hoon Min<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung Pil Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Kyun Lim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Advances in the field, especially in genomic studies and new treatment development, significantly improved the prognosis of B-ALL over the last decades. However, the B-ALL subtype harboring Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)(q34;q11) (Ph+ B-ALL) still remains a therapeutic challenge despite available targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The novel therapeutic regimens for adult B-ALL often include rituximab (RTX) - a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody - for patients with &#62;20% CD20+ blasts. Moreover, drug combinations including approved TKIs and antibodies are being tested in clinical trials. Since some TKIs display immune effector cell inhibition, investigating their immunomodulatory effects in the context of combined chemo-immunotherapies is clinically relevant for the rational combination design. We found that blasts isolated from Ph+ B-ALL patients showed the highest CD20 expression on mRNA level among defined B-ALL genetic subtypes. As Ph+ CD20+ patients may be qualified for treatment with TKIs along with RTX, this result prompted the need of investigating the effects of TKIs on immune effectors. We therefore compared how first-, second- and third-generation TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib) and allosteric inhibitor asciminib recently approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) affect innate and antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. B-ALL cell lines, patient-derived lymphoblasts propagated in NSG mice (primografts) and ex vivo whole blood assays were used for testing the efficacy of effector cell-mediated mechanisms in the presence of TKIs. The TKIs were compared in NK-cell based natural cytotoxicity tests, antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) tests and phagocytosis assays with monocyte-derived macrophages. Dasatinib was also tested using whole blood ex vivo ADCC assays before and after administration of the TKI. Out of six tested TKIs, asciminib presented the most favorable profile, causing slight or no effector cell inhibition in both innate and antibody-mediated responses. In contrast, dasatinib significantly decreased the immune cells activity in all tests, reducing natural and RTX-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells against B-ALL blasts. Dasatinib and ponatinib significantly inhibited in vitro phagocytosis of primograft B-ALL cells. To a lesser extent, cytotoxicity and phagocytosis were suppressed by imatinib, bosutinib and nilotinib. Importantly, we confirmed that the orally administered dasatinib impairs the NK cell activity in patients&#8217; blood. Our findings indicate that the TKIs differentially impact RTX-mediated effector mechanisms. The novel, allosteric TKI asciminib could be preferentially used in combination with RTX-based immunotherapy.

Multiple inhibitors targeting this pathway have been developed to treat cancer patients harboring the aberrant MAPK pathway genes. ERK inhibitors (ERKi) have been shown to be effective in a variety of solid-tumor malignancies, but like other MAPK inhibitors, they rarely confer complete and durable responses. Therefore, it is important to define the mechanism underlying potential tumor relapse following ERKi treatment. In this study, we found that ERKi treatment expanded the cancer stem cell (CSC) population in various NSCLC cell lines and a NSCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) harboring aberrant MAPK signaling. Such expansion of the CSC population is mainly caused by enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated cancer cell dedifferentiation. Mechanistically, we revealed that ERK inhibition induces EMT via pSTAT3-mediated upregulation of EMT-transcription factor Slug. Specifically, we found that ERK inhibition increased phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705, which further increased the expression of miR-204. Increased miR-204 then downregulated expression of SPDEF, a transcriptional repressor of Slug, thereby derepressing Slug expression. Moreover, we found that a low expression of Slug is necessary for maintaining stemness properties of CSCs. Thus, ERKi treatment-increased Slug must be downregulated to allow these cells to fully acquire stemness, and this process is mediated by a Slug-miR-200c negative feedback loop. Finally, we demonstrated that the JAK\/STAT pathway inhibitor Ruxolitinib can block the ERK inhibitor-induced EMT and CSCs expansion, providing a feasible combination inhibitor approach for treating NSCLC patients. Overall, these studies provide a better understanding of the tumor relapse following ERKi treatment, and define the role of Slug in <i>de novo<\/i> production of CSCs and their maintenance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6a65bf3-e81b-4ff8-8073-9198d0011d85\/@E03B8ZD6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cell,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Snail,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15002"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shurui Cai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuetao Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ananya Banerjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lavudi Kousalya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi-en Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

This unique binding mode locks SRC in its native inactive conformation, thereby inhibiting both enzymatic and scaffolding functions. Also, in contrast to other Src inhibitors in the clinic, NXP900 exhibits a unique target selectivity profile with 1000 fold selectivity for Src over Abl kinase. The aim of this current study was to perform broad cancer cell line panel screening to inform disease positioning and identify predictive biomarkers of sensitivity for this novel class of Src kinase inhibitor. We describe the results of extensive cancer cell line panel profiling across a suite of 2-dimensional(D) and 3-D in vitro cell viability and high content phenotypic profiling assays that has revealed clear patterns of cell line sensitivity and insensitivity. Among the most sensitive cell line subtypes are, squamous cell carcinoma, Arid1A mutant ovarian clear cell carcinoma and subtypes of breast luminal A and triple negative breast cancer cell lines. HER2+ breast cancer lines appear insensitive to NXP900 indicating HER2 as a potential driver of resistance to NXP900. Further in-depth bioinformatic analysis of genetic and transcriptomic profiles of sensitive cell lines has identified putative biomarkers to support patient selection and personalized healthcare strategies. These studies demonstrate the identification of cancer cell lines which exhibit high sensitivity to NXP900 and which can be grouped into discrete molecular subtypes based on gene mutation status, transcriptomics and histotype. Our result provide an indication of patient subgroups which may exhibit optimal therapeutic response to NXP900 and provide data to guide further preclinical, biomarker and clinical development.

Loss of SHP2 activity suppresses tumor cell growth, making SHP2 a potential target for cancer therapy. Here we report the discovery of GDC-1971 (formerly RLY-1971), a highly potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small-molecule SHP2 inhibitor that stabilizes SHP2 in a closed, auto-inhibited conformation. GDC-1971 potently inhibits both wild-type SHP2 (IC50 &#60;1nM) and the E76K activating mutant (IC50 &#60;250nM) in biochemical assays. In standard 2-dimensional and anchorage-independent growth conditions, GDC-1971 inhibits cellular proliferation in models harboring receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), SHP2, NF1, KRAS, or BRAF mutations in a dose-dependent manner. GDC-1971 potently inhibits the proliferation of cellular models harboring KRAS G12C or G12A mutations (median IC50 &#60;80 nM) compared to models harboring other KRAS G12, G13 or Q61 mutations (median IC50 &#62;1 uM), indicating a link between KRAS GTP hydrolysis and SHP2 dependency. Despite this trend, some non-KRAS G12C or G12A cell lines harboring other KRAS mutations responded to GDC-1971 in vitro, suggesting some heterogeneity in RTK\/SHP2 signaling dependence in subsets of other KRAS mutants. In vivo, GDC-1971 demonstrates dose-dependent RAS\/MAPK pathway inhibition and induces significant tumor-growth inhibition in human xenograft models harboring EGFR and KRAS alterations at continuous daily doses that are well tolerated. Given the reported role of SHP2 as a critical mediator of resistance to targeted therapies, we assessed the activity of GDC-1971 combinations in multiple contexts. We observed increased suppression of the MAPK signaling cascade and anti-proliferation synergy when combining GDC-1971 with EGFR, ALK, and KRAS G12C inhibitors in vitro. The observed in vitro synergy translated to dramatic anti-tumor growth effects in vivo. GDC-1971 in combination with the KRAS G12C covalent inhibitor GDC-6036 resulted in significant regressions at doses well below those required for single agent activity in a KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC xenograft model. In rodent and dog toxicology studies, GDC-1971 is well tolerated at exposures above those required to induce regression in xenograft models. The biochemical and cellular potency and favorable pharmaceutical properties of GDC-1971 support the further clinical development in RTK\/MAPK pathway altered tumors using continuous daily dosing alone and in combination with other targeted agents, including the KRAS-G12C inhibitor GDC-6036 (clinical trial NCT04449874).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8184f0c6-a4ae-4af4-bb03-6d5451bf148b\/@w03B8ZD7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),SHP2,RAS\/MAPK,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15004"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bret Williams<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Taylor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Orozco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Owen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Kelley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andre Lescarbeau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelley Shortsleeves<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Randy Kipp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vy Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erin Brophy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Wilbur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Lanzetta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nigel Waters<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sherri Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabrizio Giordanetto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Maragakis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack Greismann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsay Willmore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Therrien<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Evangelista<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Gerosa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Merchant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alfonso Arrazate<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pablo Sáenz-López Larrocha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Chun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Hunsaker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gauri Deshmukh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine M.

Outcomes have improved in patients with <i>EGFR<\/i>-driven NSCLC since the introduction of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); however, treatment resistance almost inevitably occurs. It has been reported that patients harboring the <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R mutation, who represent 3.4% of lung adenocarcinoma cases in North America and 23% in Asia, have poorer outcomes than those with <i>EGFR<\/i> ex19del, suggesting a significant unmet need in this population. BLU-945 and BLU-701 are investigational, reversible, selective, and orally available TKIs optimized for use as single-agent or combination therapy to effectively suppress activating and on-target resistance EGFR mutants while sparing WT EGFR, and have the potential to treat or prevent central nervous system metastases. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies previously demonstrated the antitumor activity of BLU-945 against EGFR L858R\/T790M and EGFRm\/T790M\/C797S mutants, and BLU-701 against EGFR ex19del and EGFRm\/C797S mutants. Because <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R-driven NSCLC constitutes a large population of patients who may not be receiving the same benefit from third-generation (3G) TKIs as those with <i>EGFR<\/i> ex19del, studies were conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of BLU-945 and BLU-701, as single agents and in combination, in preclinical NSCLC tumor models driven by L858R in the absence of the T790M mutation.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>The <i>in vivo <\/i>antitumor activities of BLU-945 and BLU-701, as single-agents or in combination, were evaluated in 2 <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R-driven<i> <\/i>patient-derived xenograft (PDX) subcutaneous tumor models and in an engineered <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R\/C797S-driven Ba\/F3 cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) subcutaneous tumor model.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Oral daily administration of single-agent BLU-945 and single-agent BLU-701 resulted in sustained tumor regression in 2 PDX models of <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R NSCLC. Compared with single agents in an <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R\/C797S Ba\/F3 CDX tumor model, combination of BLU-945 with BLU-701 resulted in marked antitumor activity and prolonged tumor regression.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION: <\/b>The <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activities of BLU-945 and BLU-701 in preclinical tumor models suggest that both BLU-945 and BLU-701 have the potential to be used in patients with <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R-driven NSCLC, including those who are treatment na&#239;ve or previously treated with 3G TKI. Combining BLU-945 and BLU-701 may enable coverage of frequent on-target resistance mechanisms, including the <i>EGFR<\/i> C797S mutation, in addition to the common L858R activating mutation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a3f2e5c1-730b-4a11-870c-c8ff41f0670c\/@w03B8ZD7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Combination therapy,Antitumor activity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15005"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"a5037c31-beb3-4477-9c99-0bce8ff2146f","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5037c31-beb3-4477-9c99-0bce8ff2146f\/@w03B8ZD7\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Luz Tavera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Schalm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Campbell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clare Medendorp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxine Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faris Albayya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Dineen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhuo Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Iliou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ebby Job<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nisha Perez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoav Timsit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Wardwell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie McGinn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Woessner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Chiara Conti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In glioblastoma (GBM), EGFR and PI3K are two of the most mutated genes and result in hyperactivation of these kinases. However, single agent inhibition has offered minimal success, largely due to the development of resistance from compensatory downstream signaling pathways. One strategy to circumvent resistance and improve efficacy in GBM is to use combination therapy, such as concurrent inhibition of EGFR or PI3K with inhibition of relevant epigenetic modulators. In GBM, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is an important epigenetic regulator that has shown to promote kinase signaling in cancer models. Therefore, the present study sought to define the relationship between the EGFR\/PI3K signaling pathway and LSD1 and to evaluate the efficacy of co-inhibition of EGFR\/PI3K and LSD1 in GBM.Transcriptional changes were examined following knockdown of LSD1 in isogenic human GBM cells using RNA-seq. These data were analyzed by GSEA to evaluate biological processes associated with the LSD1 expression. We identified several kinase signaling processes that were enriched in GBM cells with wild type LSD1 such as gene sets for regulation of PI3K activity, RTK binding, and transmembrane RTK activity. The effect of kinase inhibition on LSD1 expression was assessed using western blot analysis. We also evaluated the effects of LSD1 inhibition on expression of downstream kinase signaling proteins. Three kinase inhibitors directed against either EGFR or PI3K were evaluated in GSCs as single agents and in combination with LSD1 inhibitors. The three kinase inhibitors, osimertinib, erlotinib, and BKM120, all have evidence of some brain penetrance. We also evaluated a novel dual kinase inhibitor, MTX-241, which targets both EGFR and PI3K simultaneously. Five LSD1 inhibitors were assessed for their ability to enhance efficacy of EGFR\/PI3K inhibitors.Our results demonstrate that LSD1 protein expression can be modulated by stimulation of EGFR in patient-derived GSCs. We observed an increase in LSD1 protein expression following the addition of EGF in GSC 17 cells. The concurrent inhibition of EGFR\/PI3K and LSD1 enhanced the <i>in vitro<\/i> efficacy compared to single agent, supporting convergence of kinase signaling and LSD1 dependent pathways. In fact, several treatment combinations of EGFR\/PI3K inhibitors and LSD1 inhibitors resulted in synergistic effects in multiple GSC lines.In summary, our results highlight the need for effective therapy combinations that can reduce the population of GSCs and avoid the adaptive resistance that is typical of kinase inhibitors. Future studies will focus on evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of the most promising treatment combinations <i>in vivo<\/i> using orthotopic xenograft models of the GSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0aea60d-a8cd-4c4d-a487-e988090e0447\/@w03B8ZD7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Kinase inhibitors,Epigenetics,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15007"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lea Stitzlein<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Luetzen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caitlin McCabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maninder Khosla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoping Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yue Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joy Gumin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederick Lang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Whitehead<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Sebolt-Leopold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joya Chandra<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, they are characterized by modest selectivity and\/or limited central nervous system (CNS) penetrance in instances of CNS disease. GB5121 is an orally available, selective, irreversible small molecule BTK inhibitor. GB5121 was selected based on its potency, specificity, and high brain penetrance in preclinical models. We evaluated its pharmacodynamic properties using both cell-free enzymatic and cell-based functional assays, showing covalent BTK inactivation with a potency in the nM range. GB5121 furthermore demonstrated rapid BTK inactivation kinetics (Kinact\/Ki) in both peripheral and CNS tissue, a critical parameter for covalent irreversible inhibitors. In a kinome scan, GB5121 exhibited high kinase selectivity against 349 kinases with only TEC\/TXK demonstrating &#62;50% inhibition at 1 &#181;M; GB5121 did not inhibit phosphorylation of EGFR in a cell-based assay. When compared with other BTK inhibitors, GB5121 showed superior CNS target occupancy using a probe-based ELISA measuring free BTK in the brain of mice receiving 3 daily oral doses of 10 mg\/kg. GB5121 also demonstrated significantly higher brain to plasma ratio in mice with an intact blood brain barrier. Specifically, GB5121 showed ~2-fold higher brain concentrations with lower plasma levels than ibrutinib. In non-human primates, a 1:1 brain to plasma concentration ratio was demonstrated for GB5121 for up to 8 hours with both oral (30 mg\/kg) and IV (2 mg\/kg) doses. Together, these features differentiate GB5121 from both FDA-approved BTK inhibitors as well as those currently under clinical investigation. Our data supports the use of GB5121 in clinical trials where BTK is a known driver of malignancies, including in CNS lymphoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/245bfeff-d730-4d90-9a1c-9e1d95abdeaa\/@w03B8ZD7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BTK,Lymphoma,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15008"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isharat Yusuf<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunil Sahdeo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor Ismaili<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary Naiman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Guimond<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theodore Schiff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan Clemons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krystal Herman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryanna Paulson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kay Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Taylor Meadows<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Kennedy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Rose<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Carter<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here, we applied an unbiased systems-based modeling approach called Kinome Regularization (KiR) to identify candidate kinase inhibitors (KIs) for the treatment of CRPC. KiR is a method of target deconvolution that harnesses the polypharmacology of KIs to identify critical kinases involved in a specific cellular activity (i.e., cell proliferation). By computationally integrating the results of a functional drug screen with prior biochemical knowledge, we generated KiR models for a panel of PCa cell lines that predict KIs effective at abrogating CRPC cell growth and proliferation. Two predicted KIs (PP121 and SC-1) showed significant inhibition of PCa cell growth and kinase-mediated growth factor signaling <i>in vitro <\/i>and in primary subcutaneous tumors. However, therapy resistance emerged in bone metastases, as identified by analysis in a 3D in vitro engineered bone mimetic environment and in tumors implanted in mouse bones. A combination of PP121 and SC-1 with standard-of-care chemotherapy overcame the resistance, enhancing both tumor response and mouse survival. These results suggest that combining multi-targeted KIs with chemotherapy may represent an effective strategy for CRPC treatment.<br \/>Overall, our findings demonstrate the application of a multidisciplinary strategy that blends bench science with machine-learning approaches for rapidly identifying KIs that result in desired phenotypic effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Bone metastasis,Kinase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15010"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Thomas Bello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Paindelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Diaz-Gomez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonios Mikos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Nelson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taranjit Gujral<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Eleonora Dondossola<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, the emergence of acquired resistance or de novo resistance are persistent clinical problems. The objective of this study was to examine neratinib (NER), an irreversible pan-HER inhibitor approved for early-stage and metastatic HER2+ BC, and dasatinib (DAS), a multi-kinase inhibitor used to treat certain leukemias, as a new treatment for HER2-targeted therapy resistant HER2+ BC and triple negative BC (TNBC).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The anti-proliferative effect of NER plus DAS was screened in a panel of 20 breast cancer cell lines using a 5-day acid phosphatase assay. This panel included 12 HER2+ (3 trastuzumab (TRAS) sensitive (SKBR3, BT474, EFM192A), 2 acquired TRAS resistant (BT474-T, SKBR3-T), 3 innately TRAS resistant (HCC1954, HCC1569, JIMT1), and 4 acquired neratinib resistant cell lines (HCC1954-N, HCC1569-N, SKBR3-N, BT474-N), 6 triple negative (BT20, HCC1143, HCC1937, MDA-MB- 157\/231\/468), and 2 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cell lines (MCF7, ZR-75-1). Drug synergy was examined using Combenefit and Calcusyn software. Combination Index (CI) values &#60; 1 indicated synergy, &#62; 1 antagonism. Neratinib IC50 values &#60; 150nM were considered physiologically relevant. Prolonged exposure in vitro efficacy was tested in these cell lines by treating twice weekly with NER +\/- DAS until resistance emerged. Cell confluence was then quantified using a crystal violet-based method. The safety and efficacy of NER (10 mg\/kg) plus DAS (15 mg\/kg) was investigated in vivo in HER2+ HCC1954 xenografts in BALB\/c nude mice.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> NER was highly effective against HER2+ BC cell lines regardless of TRAS sensitivity (IC50 values range 1-172 nM), showed moderate activity in TNBC (IC50 value range 31 nM - &#62;1 &#956;M), and did not achieve &#60;1 &#956;M activity in ER+ BC cell lines. NER resistant cell lines had IC50 values greater than 150 nM DAS alone displayed IC50 values from 8-135 nM in 4\/6 TNBC cell lines, with all 6 TNBC cell lines sensitive to either the single agents or the combination at concentrations less than 100 nM. DAS enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of NER in the HCC1954, HCC1569, JIMT1 cell lines (CI values = 0.27-0.62). The NER\/DAS combination overcame NER resistance in all acquired NER-resistant cell line models and no antagonism was observed in any cell line tested. Matrix assays confirmed synergy at low nanomolar concentrations of both drugs. NER plus DAS had a greater long term in vitro anti-proliferative effect over NER in HCC1954, HCC1569, and JIMT1 cells, preventing or delaying the development of NER resistance. NER plus DAS was well tolerated in mice for over 60 days. The combination was better than single agents and showed prolonged anti-tumor effect against HCC1954 xenografts in vivo (p=0.02).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This study suggests that the addition of DAS to NER may have potential as a new treatment strategy for BC, particularly for HER2+ BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/520430ef-3d09-4351-9d67-c52bb2831bc9\/@x03B8ZD8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15013"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Neil T.

NSCLC patients with exon 20 insertions have a worse prognosis compared to those with other activating EGFR mutations. Moreover, approximately one-third of patients with exon 20 insertion mutations develop central nervous system (CNS) metastases over the course of their disease. Unfortunately, current therapeutics lack sufficient brain exposure for treating this patient population. ORIC-114 is a brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible small molecule inhibitor designed to target exon 20 insertions in EGFR and HER2. Notably, ORIC-114 is highly selective for the EGFR family of receptors, with excellent kinome selectivity compared to other reported exon 20 inhibitors, reducing the risk of off-target kinase liabilities.&#8239;The superior brain penetration and free unbound exposure of ORIC-114 in preclinical studies also differentiates it from comparator EGFR and HER2 exon 20 targeted agents.<br \/>To further characterize ORIC-114, in vivo studies were undertaken to assess activity in both subcutaneous and intracranial NSCLC tumor patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Consistent with in vitro potency and selectivity, once daily oral administration of 3 mg\/kg ORIC-114 induced robust tumor regressions with greater than 100% tumor growth inhibition in the absence of significant body weight loss in an EGFR exon 20 insertion H773_V774insNPH NSCLC PDX model. In this subcutaneous model, ORIC-114 was superior to CLN-081 in efficacy and tolerability, and superior to BDTX-189 in efficacy. To investigate whether the brain-penetrant attributes of ORIC-114 translated into antitumor activity in the CNS, we utilized an intracranial PC-9 luciferase-labeled EGFR del 19 mutant cell line model. Once daily oral administration of ORIC-114 significantly regressed established intracranial NSCLC tumors and demonstrated greater efficacy than TAK-788, commensurate with the superior brain exposure of ORIC-114. We further explored dosing regimens in this intracranial model and found that ORIC-114 demonstrated equivalent regressions at 1.5 mg\/kg twice daily and 3 mg\/kg once daily, and strong efficacy with 1.5 mg\/kg once daily dosing. Taken together, these data confirm ORIC-114 as a potent, selective, irreversible, brain penetrant exon 20 inhibitor, and a promising therapeutic candidate, including for patients with CNS metastases. Based upon these data, ORIC-114 is entering a Phase 1\/1b clinical trial in genetically defined cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/289f538c-66aa-4a16-a18c-2cb7003d9798\/@x03B8ZD8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,HER2,Brain metastasis,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15015"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason E.

ROS1 fusions have been detected in diverse adult and pediatric cancers including up to 2% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 1-9% of cholangiocarcinomas, and 0.5-1% of gliomas and glioblastomas. There are over 50 known fusion partners of ROS1. Notable examples include CD74, EZR, SDC4, and SLC34A2 in NSCLC; GOPC exons 1-3 (short form or GOPC(S)) in cholangiocarcinoma; and GOPC exons 1-7 (long form or GOPC(L)) in glioblastoma. Crizotinib and entrectinib are FDA-approved ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but clinical emergence of ROS1 resistance mutations S1986F\/Y, F2004C\/I\/V, L2026M, G2032R, and D2033N restricts their therapeutic utility. Due to the diversity of ROS1 fusion partners and kinase-domain mutations, development of novel ROS1 inhibitors that retain potency against fusion variants and resistance mutations would be beneficial to address these clinical needs.<br \/>NVL-520 is a novel, brain-penetrant ROS1-selective inhibitor that exhibits preclinical activity against ROS1 alterations, including resistance mutations, while also sparing inhibition of TRKB. TRKB inhibition in the central nervous system has been implicated in adverse events observed with FDA-approved dual TRK\/ROS1 inhibitor entrectinib and FDA-approved ALK inhibitor lorlatinib. We previously reported the activity of NVL-520 in several cell line and xenograft models bearing CD74-ROS1, EZR-ROS1, and SDC4-ROS1 fusions, with a wild-type kinase domain or a G2032R mutation. Here we report a broader comparative characterization of NVL-520 and other ROS1 inhibitors against a diverse set of ROS1 fusion partners and kinase-domain mutations.<br \/>NVL-520 showed potent suppression of proliferation and\/or ROS1 signaling in Ba\/F3, NIH3T3, or human cancer cell lines expressing CD74-, EZR-, SLC34A2-, or GOPC(L)-ROS1 fusions. NVL-520 also retained potent inhibition of Ba\/F3 cells expressing ROS1 fusions with F2004C, F2004V, G2101A, or G2032R mutations. To further demonstrate the broad activity of NVL-520, we utilized NIH3T3 cells expressing CD74- or EZR-ROS1 fusions with G2032R or F2004C mutations. NVL-520 robustly suppressed colony formation and downstream effector signaling in the ROS1 G2032R and F2004C resistance mutant context. Lastly, NVL-520 demonstrated inhibition of ROS1 signaling in a human glioblastoma cell line U118MG, which harbors the GOPC(L)-ROS1 fusion. In conclusion, the preclinical profile of NVL-520 supports its potential to address a medical need for patients with a diverse array of ROS1 fusion partners and kinase-domain mutations, both in NSCLC and in other cancers such as glioblastoma. NVL-520 is being evaluated in a Phase 1\/2 clinical trial for patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC or other solid tumors (NCT05118789).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40e33fe7-477e-49a9-8869-ba1a75568ca2\/@x03B8ZD8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,Resistance,ROS1,Fusion proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15020"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anupong Tangpeerachaikul<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clare Keddy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katelyn Nicholson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monika Davare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henry E.

ALK fusions are detected in approximately 5% of advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 50% of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, 50% of adult and 90% of childhood anaplastic large cell lymphomas, and rare cases of cholangiocarcinomas. Over 90 fusion partners of ALK have been identified, each exerting a different influence on the biochemical properties of the fusion protein and its preclinical sensitivity to ALK inhibitors. Besides fusions, ALK point mutations and amplification account for up to 14% and 2% of sporadic neuroblastomas, respectively, with most activating mutations occurring at residues F1174, F1245, or R1275. Some activating mutations, such as those occurring at F1174 and I1171, also confer resistance to FDA-approved ALK inhibitors. Because ALK plays an oncogenic role in diverse cancer types, it is an important therapeutic target for other indications beyond NSCLC.<br \/>NVL-655 is a novel, brain-penetrant ALK-selective inhibitor that exhibits preclinical activity against ALK alterations, including resistance mutations, while also sparing inhibition of TRKB. TRKB inhibition in the central nervous system has been implicated in adverse events observed with FDA-approved ALK inhibitor lorlatinib. We previously reported the preclinical activity of NVL-655 in several NSCLC models bearing ALK-fusions, including human cell lines, a human cell-line derived xenograft, and a patient-derived xenograft. Here we report a broader characterization of NVL-655 in ALK-driven cancer models beyond NSCLC, alongside other ALK inhibitors that are either FDA-approved or in development.<br \/>In biochemical assays, NVL-655 showed potent inhibition (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 10 nM) of ALK with mutations at residues 1151, 1174, or 1275, all of which have been identified in neuroblastoma. In cell-based assays, NVL-655 was observed to inhibit proliferation of a human anaplastic large cell lymphoma cell line harboring NPM1-ALK fusion and human neuroblastoma cell lines harboring ALK activating mutations or amplification. In conclusion, the preclinical profile of NVL-655 supports its potential to address a medical need for patients with ALK-driven disease in both NSCLC and other cancers such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma and neuroblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/59fd4255-902c-41fd-8a2d-1faa42ae2957\/@x03B8ZD8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,Resistance,ALK,Neuroblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15022"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anupong Tangpeerachaikul<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludovic Bigot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luc Friboulet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henry E.

FLT3 inhibitors are in clinical use, but with incomplete responses and onset of resistance. New targeting strategies are needed.<b> <\/b>The oncogenic serine\/threonine kinase proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim-1) is upregulated downstream of FLT3-ITD, directly stimulates cell growth and inhibits apoptosis, and also phosphorylates and stabilizes FLT3 in a positive feedback loop. We previously showed that concurrent treatment of FLT3-ITD cells with Pim kinase and FLT3 inhibitors enhanced apoptosis induction through post-translational downregulation of the master transcription factor c-Myc and the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. The serine\/threonine kinase GSK-3&#946; regulates c-Myc and Mcl-1 protein via phosphorylation at T58 and S159, respectively; we hypothesized downregulation of both proteins by combination treatment through phosphorylation by GSK-3&#946;.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>FLT3-ITD cells lines (Ba\/F3-ITD, MV4-11, and MOLM-14) and primary FLT3-ITD AML patient blasts were cultured with the pan-Pim kinase inhibitor AZD1208, the FLT3 inhibitors gilteritinib or quizartinib and the GSK-3&#946; inhibitor TCG-24. Protein expression was measured by immunoblotting. To measure protein half-lives, cells were pretreated with cycloheximide with and without the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Ba\/F3-ITD cells were infected with Myc-T58A plasmid, preventing c-Myc T58 phosphorylation, or Mcl-1 S159A plasmid, preventing Mcl-1 S159 phosphorylation, or empty vector controls. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V labeling, measured by flow cytometry.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Combined treatment of FLT3-ITD-expressing cell lines and AML patient blasts with Pim and FLT3 inhibitors caused rapid downregulation of c-Myc, and then Mcl-1, protein expression, relative to single drugs. Combined Pim and FLT3 inhibitor treatment caused marked decrease in half-lives of both proteins, which was rescued by proteasome inhibition, as the mechanism of protein downregulation. Combined Pim and FLT3 inhibitor treatment rapidly activated (dephosphorylated) GSK-3&#946; and culture with GSK-3&#946; inhibitor prevented induction of c-Myc and Mcl-1 downregulation, increased c-Myc and Mcl-1 protein turnover by concurrent Pim and FLT3 inhibitor treatment.

New therapies are urgently needed. Both MERTK tyrosine kinase and the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 have been implicated as therapeutic targets in AML and ETP-ALL. We developed MRX-2843, a novel small molecule MERTK and FLT3 inhibitor currently in clinical trials in patients with leukemia. The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax is FDA-approved for treatment of AML and has clinical activity in relapsed\/refractory T-ALL. Here, we investigated the impact of treatment with MRX-2843 in combination with BCL-2 inhibitors in preclinical models. Human AML and ETP-ALL cell lines were treated with MRX-2843 and\/or a BCL-2 inhibitor for 48-72 hours and relative cell numbers were determined using CellTiter-Glo reagent. Synergy was assessed by mathematical modeling using the response additivity and fractional product methods. Combined treatment with MRX-2843 and venetoclax provided enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to MRX-2843 or venetoclax alone. The interaction between drugs was dose-dependent and synergistic in AML cell lines. For instance, in KG-1 cells combined treatment with an IC50 concentration of MRX-2843 and an IC15 concentration of venetoclax reduced cell density by 88 &#177; 4.0% and the combination was significantly more effective than MRX-2843 or venetoclax alone (p &#60; 0.0001, 2-way ANOVA). Moreover, the 88% reduction in cell density in cultures treated with the combination was significantly greater than the 58 &#177; 1.6% reduction expected for an additive interaction (p &#60; 0.0001). Robust therapeutic activity and dramatic synergy were also observed in NOMO-1 and OCI-AML5 cell cultures treated with the combination and the interaction between drugs was additive or synergistic in Loucy ETP-ALL cells. Enhanced therapeutic efficacy and synergistic interactions were also observed in AML cell cultures treated with MRX-2843 and navitoclax, a BCL-2 and BCL-XL inhibitor, implicating BCL-2 inhibition as a mechanism of synergy. In a high-throughput screen, MRX-2843 mediated synergistic anti-leukemia activity in combination with venetoclax in all 7 AML and both ETP-ALL cell lines tested. Synergy was optimal when MRX-2843 and venetoclax were administered in a 1:20 ratio. Our data (i) implicate combined treatment with MRX-2843 and a BCL-2 inhibitor, such as venetoclax, as a promising new strategy for treatment of both AML and ETP-ALL, (ii) define optimized dosing strategies for MRX-2843 and venetoclax combination therapy, and (iii) support further evaluation of MRX-2843 in combination with venetoclax in murine models and potentially in upcoming clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/efbf8dd2-3870-403e-b993-f6b8cb1e1744\/@x03B8ZD8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15025"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aashis Thapa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juhi Jain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan J.

Despite recent advances in drug development and increased understanding of genetic alterations that drive HGSC progression, mortality has not declined, highlighting the need for novel therapies. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have become the mainstay of HGSC targeted therapy research given that these tumors are driven by a high degree of genomic instability resulting from the combination of fast DNA replication rates and numerous defects in the DNA-damage response (DDR) pathway. Nonetheless, only ~25% of these patients initially respond to treatment and a significant percentage eventually relapses with resistant disease. Here, we discovered that a Small Molecule Activator of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (SMAP-061) induces apoptosis in both established and patient-derived HGSC cell lines as well as in genetically distinct Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Interestingly, we also uncovered that several genes that make-up the heterotrimer PP2A tumor suppressor protein are heterozygously lost in more than 95% of HGSC tumors, second only to p53. Mechanistically, we show that stabilization of PP2A protein by SMAP-061 inhibits the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway via the direct inhibition of RAD51, ultimately leading to chronic accumulation of DNA damage and thus programmed cell death. Furthermore, we found that SMAP-061&#8217;s ability to inhibit HR potentiated the effects of PARP inhibition and resulted in synergistic cell death in both HR proficient and deficient models. These studies emphasize the potential of PP2A activators to expand the patient population that can benefit from PARPi therapies and possibly overcome PARPi resistance. In sum, our data highlights a new role of PP2A in regulating the DDR pathway in HGSC and supports the use of SMAPs in both HR proficient and deficient HGSC tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/48ca3867-5559-44ab-b8ce-590e40301cb9\/@x03B8ZD8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Small molecule drugs,Ovarian cancer,Tumor suppressor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15114"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rita A.

While mutations to <i>PPP2R1A<\/i>, encoding the predominant protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) scaffolding protein A&#945;, occur in 30-40% of cases, the clinical actionability of these mutations has not been studied. Here, we show that mutation to A&#945; results in synthetic lethality to treatment with inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), and multiple models of A&#945; mutant uterine serous tumors were sensitive to Clofarabine, an RNR inhibitor <i>in vivo<\/i>. A&#945; mutant cells displayed impaired checkpoint signaling upon RNRi treatment, and subsequently accumulated more DNA damage than wild type cells. This was PP2A dependent as complete inhibition of PP2A activity using LB-100, a catalytic site inhibitor, sensitized wild type USC cells to RNRi. Analysis of TCGA data indicated that inactivation of PP2A, through loss of PP2A subunit expression, was prevalent in USC, with 88% of USC patients harboring loss of at least one PP2A gene. In contrast, loss of PP2A subunit expression was rare in uterine endometrioid carcinomas. While RNR inhibitors are not routinely used for uterine cancers, we identified a cohort of patients with recurrent disease treated with gemcitabine at MSKCC as a second or later line therapy. In a retrospective analysis of this cohort there was a trend for improved outcomes in USC patients treated with RNRi gemcitabine compared to patients with endometrioid histology. Overall, our data provide experimental evidence to support the use of ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors for the treatment of USC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a92c28ec-1e26-4b4d-a4f6-27c1c8673e05\/@y03B8ZD9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Phosphorylation,Ribonucleotide reductase,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15115"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caitlin M.

However, on-target resistance is observed in a substantial percentage of patients, with T790M (T) and C797S (C) observed most frequently (post-1G\/2G and post-3G, respectively). We set out to identify a next-generation inhibitor with 1) potent activity against all 8 major single (L and D), double (LT, DT, LC, DC), and triple (LTC, DTC) mutant variants, 2) selectivity over wild type (WT) EGFR, and 3) ability to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS).<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures: <\/b>Drug activity was determined by assessing effects in kinase assays and on tumor and BaF3 cell lines expressing WT or mutant forms of EGFR. For efficacy studies, mice were dosed orally once daily at doses that did not exceed the maximum tolerated dose.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Here we report the identification of a series of compounds with potent and selective in vitro and in vivo activity against all major classes of EGFR activating and resistance mutations and with selectivity over WT EGFR. A representative member from this series (Cmpd A) potently inhibits the kinase activity of EGFR L, LT, and LTC variants with IC50s &#8804;0.2 nM, compared to IC50s for osimertinib of 0.4, 0.2, and 360 nM respectively. In engineered BaF3 cells, Cmpd A inhibited viability of all 8 EGFR single, double, and triple mutant variants with IC50s &#60;7 nM, while erlotinib was inactive against LT, DT, LTC, and DTC, and osimertinib was inactive against LC, DC, LTC, and DTC. Cmpd A inhibited the activity of all 8 variants with 7- to 46-fold selectivity over WT EGFR, which compared favorably to the 7- to 10-fold selectivity erlotinib exhibited for L and D. In vivo, Cmpd A (30 mg\/kg QD) induced tumor regression, or inhibited tumor growth by at least 90%, in models containing EGFR single (L), double (LT), and triple (LTC and DTC) mutant variants.

Osimertinib is a third generation EGFR tylosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is primarily indicated for NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations. Although use of osimertinib is currently limited to patients with common EGFR mutations, it has been reported that patients with NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations demonstrated response to EGFR TKIs. Herein, we present a case of advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung with atypical EGFR L747P mutation that revealed a noteworthy durable response to osimertinib monotherapy as first line treatment. Case presentation: A 47-year-old woman with no smoking history presented with new-onset hemoptysis and cough. A chest CT scan showed a lobulated, spiculated 38 mm left upper lung mass with innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules. CT-guided biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma of lung with PD-L1 1-2%. Subsequent PET-CT scan revealed hypermetabolic neoplasm in the left lower lobe with scattered area of abnormal focal FDG uptake within the liver. Brain MRI showed unremarkable findings. The patient was diagnosed with stage IVB adenocarcinoma of lung with multiple hepatic metastases. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) NGS assay showed EGFR L747P [0.3% of variant allele frequency (VAF)] and tissue NGS assay revealed EGFR L747P missense variant c.2239_2240delinsCC (22.8 % of VAF). The patient was started on osimertinib 80 mg daily. Follow up CT scan in six week demonstrated decrease in size of the left lower lobe lung mass to 32 mm. She has maintained durable SD for six months without any adverse effects. Most recent follow-up CT scan after eight months from the treatment demonstrated SD of the mass in the left lower lobe and less prominent numerous pulmonary nodules. Discussion: It has not been reported that osimertinib monotherapy is used as first line therapy in NSCLC with EGFR L747P mutation. We report the case of durable response to osimertinib in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR L747P mutation. Our case highlights the potential efficacy of osimertinib to NSCLC with atypical EGFR mutation. Although there was a clinical trial to explore clinical activity of osimertinib in patients with NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutation, EGFR L747R mutation was not investigated at that time. To date, there are no ongoing clinical trials on the use of osimertinib in NSCLC with EGFR L747P mutation. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the efficacy of osimertinib in this type of mutation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/39bd76a3-d7f2-4bff-adf3-336e681c7b8f\/@y03B8ZD9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,EGFR,Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15498"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Horyun Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeun Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinah Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leeseul Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Hyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Kwang Chae<\/i><\/presenter>.

Single agent EGFR TKI treatment was established in clinical trials. However, a treatment-emergent mutation of T790M (T) was identified as a major source of drug resistance. Irreversible 2<sup>nd<\/sup> and 3<sup>rd <\/sup>generation EGFR TKIs were shown effective. Mutant-specific inhibition by 3<sup>rd <\/sup>generation EGFR TKIs reduced adverse events such as skin toxicities. The emergence of a missense mutation at C797 (C), to which irreversible TKIs covalently bind, limited their efficacy. Patients harboring treatment-emergent C mutations are left with few therapeutic options. Despite anecdotal reports of efficacy from 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation TKIs, these complex molecular variants involving C797 are an increasing clinical concern. To prevent the emergence of drug-resistant subclones, a broad-spectrum EGFR TKI against both treatment-emergent and drug-na&#239;ve mutants is required. Such a 4<sup>th <\/sup>generation EGFR TKI must also enable monotherapy, allowing precise dose adjustment in case of toxicity.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>Derived from BBT-176 which is under clinical evaluation (NCT04820023), we synthesized BBT-207 and other related molecules. Using Promega ADP-Glo&#8482; kinase assay, we tested compounds against wild-type (WT) and mutated EGFR proteins. Ba\/F3 cells harboring WT and mutated EGFR genes were created and cell viability was measured by CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#174;<\/sup> and SpectraMax iD3<sup>&#174;<\/sup>. In vivo anti-tumor activity was evaluated in Ba\/F3 cell-derived xenograft models and an Osimertinib-resistant patient-derived xenograft model. Single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study was performed in animals.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>BBT-207 showed IC<sub>50 <\/sub>values &#60; 10 nM against EGFR triple mutants (DTC and LTC) and comparable IC<sub>50 <\/sub>values against double mutants (DC and LC), while Osimertinib was ineffective in both groups. BBT-207 was also as active as Gefitinib to single mutants (D and L). Double mutants containing T790M (DT and LT) were inhibited effectively by BBT-207 and Osimertinib at similar concentrations, while not by Gefitinib. In in vivo models to which Osimertinib was inactive (LC and DTC), significant tumor growth inhibition was observed from BBT-207 alone, which was enhanced by the addition of Osimertinib.

While several small molecules have been approved (mobocertinib) or are in clinical development (e.g. CLN-081, BDTX-189) none have demonstrated meaningful CNS activity and they can be associated with treatment-limiting adverse events, including wild-type (WT) EGFR-mediated toxicities. LNG-451 is a potent covalent inhibitor of EGFR Ex20ins (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 7 - 78 nM) and other EGFR oncogenic mutations (e.g L858R IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 3 nM, exon 19 deletion IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 24 nM) while being selective against WT EGFR (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 1630 nM). LNG-451 causes tumor regression in both cell line-derived and patient-derived EGFR Ex20ins-dependent xenograft tumor models. In a rat CNS PK model, a single oral dose of 30 mg\/kg LNG-451 achieved high exposures in plasma (AUC<sub>0 - 8h<\/sub> = 9771 ng&#8226;h\/mL) and brain (AUC<sub>0 - 8h<\/sub> = 10,041 ng&#8226;h\/g). In a rat steady-state CNS PK model, unbound partition coefficient for LNG-451 was determined to be Kpu,u = 0.66. To evaluate the potential for LNG-451 to treat metastatic brain disease driven by EGFR mutations, an intracranial PC9-luc xenograft mouse model harboring an EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation was used (LNG-451 cellular EGFR Del19 IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 10.6 nM). LNG-451 had dose-dependent exposures in the plasma and brain with both high mean brain exposure (e.g 1074 ng\/g with 25 mg\/kg LNG-451) and high mean brain to plasma ratios (e.g. 0.451 for 25 mg\/kg LNG-451). LNG-451 treatments were well-tolerated and produced significant anti-tumor activities with 99.5% (2.5 mg\/kg LNG-451) and 99.9% (25 mg\/kg LNG-451) reductions in total bioluminescence signal (BLI) and regression of tumor BLI (2.5 mg\/kg LNG-451 28.8% regression; 25 mg\/kg LNG-451, 80.3% regression). An <i>ex vivo<\/i> imaging analysis of the brain and spinal cords from all animals at the end of the study showed a dose-dependent decrease in the bioluminescent signal in both brain and spinal cords from mice treated with LNG-451 relative to the vehicle control animals. Taken together, LNG-451 is a CNS-penetrant, wild-type EGFR-sparing, EGFR Ex20ins inhibitor that is expected to provide strong anti&#8209;tumor efficacy for patients with advanced\/metastatic solid cancers harboring oncogenic EGFR exon 20 insertions with reduced WT EGFR driven toxicities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41a6cd5e-1d32-4047-807c-c9aaeabced44\/@y03B8ZD9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Kinase inhibitors,Brain metastasis,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21440"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul G.

LNG-451 is a CNS-penetrant, wild-type EGFR-sparing, covalent inhibitor of EGFR Ex20ins. In cell viability assays dependent on five EGFR Ex20ins mutations, LNG-451 was a potent inhibitor (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 7 - 78 nM) including the three most prevalent insertions (V769_D770insASV IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 78 nM, D770_N771insSVD IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 53 nM, H773_V774insNPH IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 75 nM). LNG-451 had low potency in WT EGFR dependent cell assays (WT EGFR Ba\/F3 IC<sub>50<\/sub>=1,960 nM, cell panel IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 1630 nM). LNG-451 was 21-fold selective for its least potent Ex20ins (V769_D770insASV) relative to WT EGFR. LNG-451 potently inhibited cells dependent on EGFR L861Q (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 6 nM), EGFR G719S (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 8 nM), and EGFR G719S\/T263P (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 11 nM). LNG-451 is a highly selective kinase inhibitor (1 &#956;M LNG-451, &#62;90% inhibition for 7 of 409 WT kinases) with screening hits having a similarly positioned cysteine as EGFR. In a Ba\/F3 cell-derived xenograft model harboring an EGFR V769_D770insASV exon 20 insertion mutation (EGFR V769_D770insASV CDX), 10 and 50 mg\/kg LNG-451 QD PO dosing for 15 days was well-tolerated and resulted in tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 75.7% and 105.4%, respectively. LNG-451 was efficacious and well-tolerated in the EGFR Ex20ins HuPrime<sup>&#174;<\/sup> LU0387 H773-V774insNPH patient-derived xenograft tumor model: 10 mg\/kg LNG-451 QD, 67% TGI; 50 mg\/kg LNG-451 QD, 91% tumor regression. LNG-451 was highly active in the intracranial PC9-luc xenograft mouse model. In a single dose PK\/PD study using the EGFR V769_D770insASV CDX, similar LNG-451 concentrations were observed in tumor, large intestine, and skin tissues (e.g. 50 mg\/kg LNG-451 3h post dose: tumor, 8387 ng\/mL; large intestine tissue, 14483 ng\/mL; skin, 4623 ng\/mL). LNG-451 potently suppressed EGFR phosphorylation in tumor tissue (e.g. 99%, 3 h post 50 mg\/kg dose) but had minimal-to modest suppression of phospho-EGFR in large intestine tissue (e.g. 4.2%, 3h post 50 mg\/kg dose) and skin tissue (e.g 1.9%, 3h post 50 mg\/kg dose). Taken together, LNG-451 is a wild-type EGFR-sparing, CNS-penetrant EGFR Ex20ins inhibitor that is expected to provide strong anti&#8209;tumor efficacy for patients with advanced\/metastatic solid cancers harboring oncogenic EGFR exon 20 insertions with reduced WT EGFR-driven toxicities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/88af0b65-2c4f-4733-a7e9-2bd235c5214e\/@y03B8ZD9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Kinase inhibitors,Lung cancer,Brain metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15011"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brion W.
