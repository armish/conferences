Now, we need to build on the success of such first generation PARP inhibitors through the use of rational evidence-based biomarker-driven strategies in the clinic. We can potentially accomplish this through the development of novel potent PARP1-selective inhibitors, which may lead to an improved therapeutic index and patient benefit, and the development of rational PARP inhibitor combinations with other molecularly targeted agents or immunotherapeutics, taking in consideration potential supra-additive toxicities. Finally, given recent advances in drug discovery efforts, we now have the opportunity to go beyond PARP by drugging other key DNA Damage Response (DDR) targets in the clinic, including ATR, WEE1, DNA-PK, RAD51, POLQ and USP1. I will discuss the progress we have made in the clinic, the potential pitfalls, and the promise that such novel approaches hold in improving patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,PARP inhibitors,Molecular targets,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy A.
