[{"Abstract":"Potential differences and mechanism in metabolism among bladder cancer (BLCA) patients of diverse race or ethnicities remain largely unexplored. Even though the incidence rate of BLCA in African Americans (AA) is nearly half as that of European Americans (EA), but AA have the worst survival. We performed the transcriptomics and metabolomics profiling in ancestry verified patients from AA and EA BLCA and observed mitochondrial complex activities were uniquely enriched in AA tumors compared to EA tumors. In addition, <i>in vitro<\/i> assay demonstrated differences in mitochondrial complex protein and activity between AA and EA BLCA. We further confirmed the reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism using <i>in vitro<\/i> 13C labeled tracers in both AA and EA BLCA. Integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics data reveals the enrichment of mTOR pathway in AA BLCA. Our findings indicate that an elevated mitochondrial oxphos activity through mTOR activation could be a factor for AA BLCA progression and provide the rationale to examine mitochondrial specific inhibitors along with mTOR inhibitors to target BLCA on subset of patients from the AA community.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/041415bb-8ba3-4417-ae6b-4154c71e6b94\/@A03B8ZHZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Mitochondria,Race,mTOR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12490"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Karthik Reddy Kami Reddy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Hyoung Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roni J.

Yet, most cancers and other rapidly proliferating cells rely on a functioning mitochondrial TCA cycle to generate important biosynthetic intermediates required for cell growth, and on the electron transport chain for pyrimidine synthesis and to recycle electron acceptors. Thus, increases in a number of mitochondrial activities have been proposed to be required for robust proliferation in most cancers. Mitochondrial function is regulated in part through mitochondrial biogenesis, which is influenced by mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn). We previously developed an<i> in situ<\/i> hybridization method to quantify mtDNAcn in specific cell compartments in relation to normal physiological functioning and disease processes. We reported marked cell type heterogeneity across normal tissues including relatively higher mtDNAcn in a number of stem\/proliferative compartments in humans and mice (PMID: 32304697). More recently, we combined this<i> in situ<\/i> approach with immunohistochemistry and reported increased mtDNAcn along with widespread heterogeneity in prostate cancer (DOI: 10.1158\/1538-7445.AM2021-2404). We also found increased mtDNAcn in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, the main precursor to prostate cancer, as well as precursor lesions in the large intestine and pancreas. To interrogate the functional significance of this mtDNAcn alteration, we sought to determine whether increased and heterogeneous mtDNAcn levels are accompanied by corresponding changes in its gene expression (mtRNA). To establish an initial survey of the landscape of steady state mtRNA levels, we used the RNAscope HiPlex system for multiplex<i> in situ <\/i>hybridization for 4 different mtRNAs along with<i> in situ<\/i> hybridization for mtDNA and combined this with immunofluorescence. In normal prostatic epithelium, we observed that the overall mtRNA expression pattern correlated with mtDNAcn, with higher levels in the basal cell layer compared with the luminal cell layer. We also found that, similar to changes in mtDNAcn in invasive prostate cancer, the 4 mtRNAs were upregulated yet heterogeneous in cancer lesions. Among the invasive tumors, cribriform prostate cancer showed distinct mtDNA and mtRNAs expression patterns, with higher signals in the peripheral cells than central cells, suggesting underlying biological differences in this unique histologic pattern. This spatial pattern in cribriform lesions correlated with the pattern of MYC protein expression, which is known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. Overall, we present a novel approach that advances the ability to quantify mtDNAcn and mtRNAs simultaneously in specific cell types while preserving the tissue spatial context. These findings suggest that increased mitochondrial function accompanies prostate cancer development and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e6e9742d-1ec4-41e5-b86c-d56c6412e77e\/@A03B8ZHZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondrial DNA,Prostate cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12491"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiayu Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qizhi Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica L.

Although increased glycolytic flux in proliferating cells is well established, metabolic changes associated with mitochondria still remain elusive. Here, using various inducible quiescence models and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we directly compared mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle activity from the same cells in the proliferative and quiescent states. We found that mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle flux is significantly increased during proliferation in both transformed and non-transformed cell lines. This increase was supported by mitochondrial fusion rather than mitochondrial biogenesis. Notably, as cells transitioned from a quiescent state to a proliferative state, the elongation of mitochondria occurred as quickly as 3 hours. Our results reveal that the Warburg effect, which was originally associated with dysfunctional mitochondria, does not necessitate decreased mitochondrial respiration. Rather, in many proliferating cancer cells, mitochondrial respiration is actually elevated, underscoring the importance of mitochondrial respiration during proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b1502bc-80f8-402d-8076-76fa3e3ec393\/@A03B8ZHZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Cancer cell,Proliferation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12492"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yahui Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Conghui Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ethan Stancliffe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald Fowle-Grider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rencheng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michaela Schwaiger-Haber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leah P.

GBMrecurrence is in part due to self-renewing tumor initiating cells, often called glioma stemcells (GSCs), which are characterized by their proliferation and tumor formation capacity,as well as their metabolic features. Thus, mitochondrial function represents a potentiallink between cellular metabolism and differentiation state. Mitochondrial fission isindispensable for growing and dividing cells. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is essentialfor this process. In particular, there is cumulative evidence that links Drp1 with severaltypes of cancers, including GBM. Regulation of Drp1 is mainly controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs). Importantly, recent studies have shown CDK5-dependent phosphorylation at the activating site serine 616 of Drp1 enhancesmitochondrial fission. CDK5 plays a crucial role in the central nervous system as well as,in tumor progression. Therefore, our lab hypothesized that inhibition of CDK5 would targetmitochondrial function in order to decrease tumor growth and sensitize brain tumors toconventional therapies. Western blot analysis has shown that CDK5-dependentphosphorylation of Drp1 is present in GSCs and GBM cell lines but absent in non-stemtumor cells (NSTC) and astrocytes. Small-molecule CDK5 inhibitors or CDK5 knockdownthrough siRNA in GSCs and GBM cell lines decreased activating phosphorylation of Drp1,leading to elongation of mitochondria morphology and corresponding reductions in cellviability and cell proliferation. Additionally, CDK5 inhibition showed sensitization toionizing radiation (IR) in GSCs and GBM cells. Importantly, CDK5 inhibition or knockdowncombined with IR, showed increased levels of cleaved caspase-7 and cleaved PARPsuggesting a role for apoptosis in decreased cell proliferation and sensitization to IR.Interestingly, CDK5 inhibition also diminished mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.Overall, these findings highlight an important role for CDK5 in regulating mitochondrialfunction in GBM, and targeting CDK5 offers a novel strategy to sensitize tumors to chemo-and radiotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/08491f09-2b2d-4556-91fe-99f46d8fde64\/@B03B8ZJ1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Mitochondria,CDK,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12494"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adina Brett-Morris<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Mears<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristy Rochon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recent studies have shown that some forms of hematologic malignancies (Ashton et al., 2018) and solid tumors (Molina et al., 2018) have an energy metabolism highly dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Tigecycline, a US FDA approved antibiotic, has been shown to inhibit synthesis of mitochondrion-encoded proteins leading to selective lethality in hematologic malignancies reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (Norberg et al., 2017). Combination treatment with the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib and tigecycline eradicated therapy-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> (Kuntz et al., 2017).<br \/>We have previously reported that elatol,&nbsp;the major compound from algae&nbsp;<i>Laurencia microcladia<\/i>, is effective against several non-Hodgkin lymphomas and primary CML cells (Peters et al., 2018). <i>In vitro<\/i> studies showed that elatol inhibits eIF4A1 helicase activity, suppressing cytoplasmic cap-dependent translation initiation. Further assessments using <sup>35-<\/sup>S-methionine incorporation in HEK293T cells treated with single-digit micromolar concentrations of elatol for short periods revealed strong downregulation of mitochondrion-encoded proteins (no transcriptional effect). This was confirmed in CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines whose 24-hour elatol LD<sub>50 <\/sub>ranged from high nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations. This potency was 2-10x higher than for tigecycline in side-by-side comparisons across several leukemia cell lines. Through sedimentation property analysis using sucrose gradients, we established that elatol does not affect integrity of small and large mitochondrial ribosomal units. Although the specific target on the mitochondrial translation apparatus remains elusive, we have uncovered that its mechanism of action differs from that of chloramphenicol, which inhibits translation elongation. Moreover, elatol treatment leads to activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) evidenced by induction of ATF4 and CHOP. We found that elatol activates the ISR through mitochondrial stress in which cleaved DELE1 binds to HRI to phosphorylate eIF2&#945;, a mechanism described in Fessler et al., 2020.<br \/>In summary, we have performed proof-of-concept studies using HEK293T and HeLa cell lines, isolated mitochondria, and CML and ALL cell lines to reveal that elatol is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis and mechanistically different from chloramphenicol. Tigecycline&#8217;s compelling preclinical data in combination with TKI informed design of a pending clinical trial (NCT02883036). Elatol&#8217;s greatly improved potency provides a potential starting point for further optimization of this paradigm.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/604bca0e-72e8-497b-9336-7f33e20ce515\/@B03B8ZJ1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Stress response,Chronic myelogenous leukemia,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12495"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tyler A.

In the United States, there will be over 235,760 cases of lung cancer with an estimated death of 131,880 individuals in 2021. Despite significant improvement in multimodal therapeutic approaches, overall 5-year survival rate is only 21.7%. Lung cancer appears to be mitochondria enriched cancer, however, alteration pattern of hallmark molecular pathways associated with diverse mitochondrial functions remain largely unknown in lung tumorigenesis. Utilizing high-throughput genomic profiling, we identified altered copy number of a panel of 40 mitochondria targeted molecules in primary lung cancer patients and their histologically normal appearing follow up mucosal biopsies. These altered molecules are critical components of the mitochondrial protein carrier, OXPHOS, stress response, amino acid metabolism and apoptosis pathways. This finding suggests for clonal genetic relationship between multifocal lesions and potential role of these alterations in the evolution of second primary tumors, which is an existing problem among lung cancer patients. The Human Cancer Genome Atlas database was utilized to further assess the mRNA expression pattern of these 40 molecules and determine their clinico-pathological correlations. Immunohistochemistry and digital pathology system based evaluations were performed to validate expression pattern of key altered molecules. We identified overexpression of various critical mitochondria pathway molecules including <i>AARS2, AGMAT, SDHA, NDUFB7, LONP1, DGUOK, MRM1 <\/i>and <i>GCAT<\/i> in both lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC), predicting poor prognosis. Significant loss of expression of <i>ACSF2, ACSS1, MTCH1, SLC25A4, ACAD8 <\/i>and<i> NAGS<\/i> was evident<i> <\/i>in both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma subtypes.

Type 2 RTS patients with biallelic RECQL4 pathogenic variants have a significantly increased incidence of osteosarcoma. However, there is currently no available RTS model that recapitulates the bone malignancy phenotype in this disease, severely limiting the ability of researchers to explore new treatment avenues. Here, we generated RTS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to dissect the pathological signaling leading to RTS patient-associated osteosarcoma.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>iPSCs were reprogrammed from<b> <\/b>fibroblasts of four individuals from two RTS families, each with one affected RTS proband with<i> RECQL4<\/i> mutations and one unaffected parent. These patient iPSCs were differentiated to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and then to osteoblasts, the cell-of-origin of osteosarcoma. All of these MSCs and osteoblasts were subjected to transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq. Based on enriched mitochondrial respiratory gene signatures, we also systematically analyzed the enzymatic activities of the major mitochondrial respiratory protein complexes including complex I\/II\/III and citrate synthase enzyme activity in RTS osteoblasts by Seahorse assay. Finally, we tested the potential therapeutic effect of clinical oxidative phosphorylation complex I inhibitor IACS-010759 to treat RTS cells and dissect the pharmacological mechanisms involved.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RTS iPSC-derived osteoblasts showed defective osteogenic differentiation and a gain of <i>in vitro<\/i> tumorigenic ability. Transcriptome analysis of RTS osteoblasts revealed decreased bone morphogenesis gene expression but aberrantly upregulated mitochondrial complex I gene expression. Metabolic assays of RTS osteoblasts demonstrated elevated mitochondrial respiratory complex I function, increased oxidative phosphorylation, but decreased ATP production. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I activity by IACS-010759 selectively suppressed cellular respiration and cell viability of RTS osteoblasts. Furthermore, systems analysis of IACS-010759-induced changes to RTS osteoblasts suggested that inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in RTS osteoblasts leads to enhanced cell senescence, decreased MAPK signaling and cell cycle associated genes.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In summary, we established an RTS iPSC disease platform to dissect the pathological mechanisms involved in RTS-associated osteosarcoma.

Hence, a disruption in the balance is detrimental and has been associated with multiple pathologies including tumorigenesis. We noticed significant heterogeneity in mitochondrial morphology and function in ovarian cancer, which remains the deadliest gynecologic malignancy to date. We discovered that heterogenous mitochondrial dynamics in ovarian cancer cells were associated with specific transcript variant signatures of the fission protein Drp1 (encoded by the gene <i>DNM1L<\/i>), the primary GTPase responsible for mitochondrial fission. <i>While several Drp1 splice variants have been reported, few studies have linked expression and potential interplay of splice variants of Drp1 on mitochondrial dynamics and function with pathophysiology especially in ovarian cancer<\/i><i>. <\/i> We used 3&#8217;RACE, western blotting and LC-MS\/MS proteomics analysis to establish the identity of the major Drp1 splice variants expressed in ovarian cancer. We found ovarian cancer cell lines as well as patient-ascites derived cells, predominantly express two Drp1 variants: a transcript including both exons 16 and 17 (16\/17) and a transcript lacking exon 16 (-\/17). We also validated our findings in TCGA ovarian cancer specimens by analyzing Drp1 splice variant transcripts following annotation of TCGA raw RNAseq data and Salmon expression analysis. Our TCGA analysis of these variants highlighted significant difference in overall survival of ovarian cancer patients. Samples with high Drp1(-\/17) expression were associated with poorer overall survival compared to those predominantly expressing Drp1(16\/17). Furthermore, carrying out gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on TCGA specimens split by high expression of these two variants showed enrichment of distinct gene expression signatures. Overexpression and splice variant specific siRNA knockdown studies demonstrated that Drp1 variants have unique localization and effects on mitochondrial morphology and function. Furthermore, metabolic profiling and <sup>13<\/sup>C metabolic flux analysis highlighted variant specific alterations in mitochondrial metabolic pathways and the TCA cycle. Drp1(-\/17) expression enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function and as previously shown, Drp1(-\/17) associated with both mitochondria and microtubules, potentially implying a more regulated fission activity as a consequence of controlled subcellular localization. Additionally,<i> <\/i>Drp1(-\/17) was enriched and associated with quiescent phenotype compared to more proliferative phenotype of Drp1(16\/17). <i>Hence, expression of distinct Drp1 splice variants may be a novel mechanism to regulate mitochondrial fission<\/i><i>, and integral to ovarian cancer cell plasticity under different <\/i>selection pressures<i> during tumor progression<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/90df08a7-6d36-4304-956d-35a657b0f9be\/@B03B8ZJ1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Mitochondrial dynamics,Drp1\/DNM1L,metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12502"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zaineb Javed<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Hui Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weihua Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amal Taher Elhaw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priscilla Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Phaeton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed Trebak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vonn Walter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadine Hempel<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, we found that GSTO2 was exclusively expressed in airway basal cells, Clara cells and type II alveolar cells, which have self-renewal capacity in the lungs; however, its expression was lost in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In the present study, we restored GSTO2 expression in LSCC cell lines (LK-2 and H520) to clarify the significance of GSTO2 loss in LSCC. In both LSCC cell lines used, GSTO2 overexpression significantly inhibited cell growth and colony formation <i>in vitro<\/i>. In a subcutaneous xenograft model, GSTO2-transfected LK-2 cells formed smaller tumors in nude mice than mock-transfected cells. Upon intravenous injection into nude mice, the incidence of liver metastasis was lower in mice injected with GSTO2-transfected LK-2 cells than in those injected with mock-transfected cells. Metabolomic analyses using the XF96 extracellular flux analyzer revealed that GSTO2 overexpression suppressed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation but did not affect glycolysis. Upon JC-1 dye staining, GSTO2-transfected cells showed decreased mitochondrial membrane potential compared with mock-transfected cells. Since &#946;-catenin has been reported as a novel regulator of the OXPHOS in hepatocytes, we next examined the effect of GSTO2 expression on &#946;-catenin expression in LSCC and found that GSTO2 overexpression suppressed the expression of &#946;-catenin. Because p38 phosphorylation was accelerated in both GSTO2-transfected cells, we examined the involvement of the p38 signaling pathway in the GSTO2-mediated downregulation of &#946;-catenin as well as mitochondrial membrane potential in LSCC.When GSTO2-transfected cells were treated with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, &#946;-catenin expression and mitochondrial membrane potentialwere restored. Finally, we examine whether DNA methylation of the GSTO2 could explain the loss of GSTO2 expression in LSCC. When human LSCC cell lines were treated with 5-aza-2&#8242;-deoxycytidine, a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor, GSTO2 transcription was induced. Bisulfite sequencing showed that the promoter region of the GSTO2 was frequently methylated in LSCC tissues than that of normal tissue. Our study indicated that the loss of GSTO2 via DNA hypermethylation contributes to the cell growth and progression of LSCC, probably by modulating oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria via the p38\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c3cebeb7-f38c-4bc1-8e65-ab2c23f9d21f\/@B03B8ZJ1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Redox,Mitochondria,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12514"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryusuke Sumiya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masayoshi Terayama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teruki Hagiwara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuaki Nakata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Nagasaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuhiko Yamada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norihiro Kokudo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiromu Suzuki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kawamura I.

These pathways are emerging as important targets in oncology, and here we demonstrate that mitochondrial homeostatic pathways can be co-opted to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and complete tumor regression in xenograft and PDX models. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly heterogeneous tumor, for which novel therapies are needed. We recently described BTM-3566, a small molecule which induces apoptosis in DLBCL cell lines, including double- and triple-hit subtypes. In xenograft models BTM-3566 induces complete and durable regression in all tumor-bearing animals, importantly, no regrowth is seen through 21 days post therapy. In an expanded panel of high-risk human DLBCL PDX models BTM-3566 demonstrated a 100% response rate, and complete tumor regression in 6 of 8 PDX models. Molecular analysis revealed that BTM-3566 activates the mitochondrial protease OMA1, leading to activation of HRI kinase, phosphorylation of the eIF2a -ATF4 pathway and apoptosis in DLBCL cell lines. CRISPR-Cas9 depletion of OMA1 eliminates BTM-3566&#8217;s apoptotic activity. Substrates of OMA1 include dynamin, OPA1 and DELE1, a protein of unknown function but which has recently been shown to act as a sensor for mitochondrial dysfunction and signals through HRI kinase and ATF4. Transfection of BJAB cells with a cleavage resistant OPA1 mutant has no effect on BTM-3566 induced apoptosis. In contrast, KO of DELE1 suppresses BTM-3566 mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, knockout of the ATF4 gene has a partial effect, delaying onset of apoptosis. BTM-3566 activates OMA1 in a manner unrelated to changes in mitochondrial ATP synthesis, reactive oxygen species generation or electron transport chain inhibition. Instead, BTM-3566 induces OMA1 activity through a novel mechanism regulated by the mitochondrial protein FAM210B. FAM210B expression is negatively correlated with response to BTM-3566, and overexpression of FAM210B blocks OMA1 activation and causes complete resistance to BTM-3566 induced apoptosis. Thus, FAM210B expression is a strong predictor of sensitivity to BTM-3566 and reveals a novel mechanism of regulation of OMA1 activation. Taken together, these data support a novel antitumor mechanism in DLBCL, where BTM3566 induces mitochondrial stress, activating the OMA1-DELE1-HRI-eIF2a-ATF4 pathway leading to apoptosis and tumor regression. An Investigational New Drug application for BTM3566 in B-cell malignancies will be submitted by early Q1 2022 with initiation of first in human clinical trials the first half of 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Mitochondria,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13963"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adrian Schwarzer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matheus Oliveira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc-Jens Kleppa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andy Anantha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Cooper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todd Hembrough<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jedd Levine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Luther<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Stocum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Liesa-Roig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matt Kostura<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite chromosomal and genetic heterogeneity, AML are uniformly characterized by increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This key metabolic hallmark of leukemia was recently reported as a feature of resistance to Cytarabine (AraC)-based therapy. Also, an aggressive phenotype and poor response to chemotherapy is associated with increased levels of Bcl-2. Despite the introduction of the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN), the overall survival, particularly in older patients, remains poor. Thus, approaches to improve the sensitivity of leukemic cells to AraC-based or Bcl-2 based therapies are urgently needed.Here, we investigated the preclinical activity of ME-344, a novel isoflavone OXPHOS inhibitor, on AML cell lines and relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) patient samples <i>in vitro and<\/i> examined the efficacy of ME-344 in combination with VEN in Ara-C sensitive and resistant AML cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.ME-344 (0-300 nM, 24 hr) significantly reduced viability of AML cell lines with EC<sub>50 <\/sub>of 75-100 nM and R\/R AML patient samples with EC<sub>50 <\/sub>of 200-300 nM respectively. The cytotoxic response in AML was enhanced when ME-344 was combined with VEN, producing strong synergistic viability reduction and induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by Annexin V assay and an increased level of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP (immunoblotting). The dual inhibition of OXPHOS\/Bcl-2 reduced Mcl-1 levels and showed efficacy in Mcl-1 overexpressingand Ara-C resistant AML models.Functional metabolic characterization of AML by transcriptomics and mass spectrometry demonstrated that ME-344 effectively inhibited biosynthetic pathways of nucleotides uncovering the purine biosynthesis pathway as crucial for therapeutic efficacy. ME-344 induced a dose-dependent decrease in the oxygen consumption rate (by Seahorse assay), in both AraC-sensitive and -resistant AML cell lines, and in R\/R AML patient samples, which was further significantly potentiated by combination with VEN.Finally, in an aggressive AML xenograft model, ME-344 (200 mpk, i.v.) combined with subtherapeutic doses of VEN (25 mpk) reduced circulating leukemia burden and extended survival. Ongoing <i>in vivo<\/i> studies in AML PDX models will address the impact of ME-344 in the context of acquired AraC- and Bcl-2- resistance. In summary, our findings indicate ME-344 alone or in combination with Bcl-2 inhibition constitutes an important therapeutic modality that targets a unique metabolic vulnerability of AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9c8b87ab-916f-42f7-ab0d-04ae7cd234b4\/@B03B8ZJ1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Chemoresistance,Venetoclax,Mitochondria targeting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13965"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katie H.
