[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma (OAC) is the most strongly associated cancer with obesity. Approximately 75% of OAC patients are obese which results in chronic systemic low-grade inflammation, which is believed to drive carcinogenesis as well as influencing radiation treatment response. Adipose tissue is a regulatory organ with many downstream effects which are still not understood. This study aims to elucidate what influence adipose tissue metabolism and secretome have in treatment resistance and whether obesity alters this response.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Following patient consent, <i>ex-vivo <\/i>Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) explants were exposed to increasing doses of radiation with\/without Palmitate and Oleate. Agilent Seahorse Xfe24 was used to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in VAT explants and mitochondrial metabolic parameters in dendritic cells (DCs) following treatment with Adipose Conditioned Media (ACM). Levels of DC maturation following irradiated ACM exposure and Macrophage (M&#632;) polarisation following ACM or Tumour Conditioned Media (TCM) exposure were analyzed by flow cytometry. Irradiated ACM and TCM were analyzed via MSD 54plex ELISA to assess secreted factors on angiogenic, chemokine, cytokine, inflammatory, TH17 or vascular injury panels.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> VAT explant energy metabolism showed a significant increase for OCR and ECAR with obesity and increasing radiation exposure however OCR was significantly decreased following Palmitate treatment compared with untreated and Oleate treated adipose explants (p&#60;0.05). DCs treated with iACM showed decreased expression of CD11c, CD80, CD86, HLA-DR, CD40 and PD-L1 with increasing radiation in a dose-dependent manner and decreased HLA-DR and CD54 following ACM exposure from obese versus non-obese patients (p&#60;0.05). M&#632; showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers following ACM exposure but following TCM exposure only anti-inflammatory markers were increased (p&#60;0.05). DCs showed altered Proton Leak, Basal and ATP linked respiration following exposure to ACM (p&#60;0.05). Altered secretion of proinflammatory mediators was observed from the obese adipose secretome compared with non-obese patients and with increasing radiation doses (p&#60;0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b> We have demonstrated that obesity and increasing radiation doses can significantly alter the immune-metabolic influences of adipose tissue and further studies are profiling the lipidomic and metabolomic landscape of the adipose secretome. Alterations in the secretome of adipose tissue could potentiate the tumor microenvironment and deleteriously affect immune cell function therefore further interrogation is required to fully elucidate the influence adipose tissue may have in treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/80d8b9ea-616c-4359-a175-53640aae1f1c\/@x03B8ZC3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Metabolism,Immune cells,Obesity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16634"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fiona O'Connell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eimear Mylod<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ailsing B.

Current treatment options comprise maximal surgical resection followed by radiation and\/or chemotherapy with temozolomide. However, these therapies are not able to eliminate all tumor cells, which in turn inevitably leads to disease recurrence and an alteration of identified targets in the context of clonal evolution and potential hypermutation. T cell-based immunotherapy holds great promise to target malignant cells with CAR T cell and vaccination strategies, showing first promising results in glioblastoma. These therapies rely on the rejection of cancer cells through recognition of tumor antigens and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In previous work, we have characterized such tumor antigens in primary glioblastoma (Neidert <i>et al.<\/i>, <i>Acta Neuropathol<\/i>, 2018), nonetheless, alterations in relapsed disease have not been addressed thus far. This study investigated the whole exome, transcriptome, and mass-spectrometry-based immunopeptidome of 38 primary and 24 recurrent tumors, including 22 autologous glioblastoma pairs, to determine alterations that occur during glioblastoma progression on multiple comics levels. In concordance with Neftel <i>et al.<\/i>, <i>Cell<\/i>, 2019, we identified mutations that can be allocated to astrocyte- and mesenchymal-like classified genes. In addition, an increase in the mutation rate in recurrent glioblastoma was observed which is attributed to radiation and chemotherapy pretreatment of tumors. These newly arising tumor-specific mutations give rise to HLA-presented neoepitopes in the primary cohort. Moreover, we identified transcripts that are differentially expressed between the two cohorts, showing a higher expression of transcripts related to immune system responses in the recurrent cohort. Immunopeptidome analysis of the two cohorts revealed high frequent glioblastoma-exclusive HLA class I and class II ligands presented in both the primary and recurrent cohort, serving as universally applicable tumor antigens. Class I and II HLA ligands of each sample were analyzed and revealed 2,146 HLA class I- and 2,753 HLA class II presented antigens that were uniquely identified on primary glioblastoma. A total of 610 and 1,886 source proteins represent recurrence-exclusive antigens presented on HLA class I or II molecules, respectively. Together this work addressed differences in tumor antigen expression and presentation between primary and recurrent glioblastoma using these omics layers to create an overview of the alterations that occur during disease progression. Besides providing a deep insight into the glioblastoma (immuno-)biology during progression, this study yields targets for innovative immunotherapeutic approaches to eliminate residual cells and improve survival in glioblastoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a452c4f-7b35-450f-8341-f2f2c6d6c1d9\/@x03B8ZC3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Mass spectrometry,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16635"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marissa L.

Class I molecules play a central role in the immune system by presenting intracellular peptides derived from the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, enabling recognition by cytotoxic T cells. The heavy &#945; chain structure of HLA-A, encoded by the <i>HLA-A<\/i> gene, contains the leader peptide, the &#945;1 and &#945;2 domains that both bind the peptide, and the &#945;3 domain that binds CD8 molecules, the transmembrane region, and the cytoplasmic tail. Polymorphisms within &#945;1 and &#945;2 domains of the heavy chain are responsible for the peptide binding specificity of each class I molecule, while the light &#946;<sub>2<\/sub>-microglobulin (B2M) chain encoded by the <i>B2M <\/i>gene, is not known to be polymorphic. Among more than 6,000 HLA-A alleles, HLA-A2.1 is the most commonly expressed, and its peptide-binding motif is well understood. We developed MHC I humanized mice (B-HLA-A2.1 mice) expressing human HLA molecules to establish an <i>in vivo<\/i> experimental model for evaluating human HLA restricted T cell-mediated vaccine efficacy in oncology applications. Our strategy was to replace the <i>B2m<\/i> gene of the mouse with the sequences encompassing the human <i>B2M<\/i> CDS and <i>HLA-A2.1<\/i> gene that included leader sequence, &#945;1 and &#945;2 domains ligated to a fragment of the mouse<i> H-2D<sup>b<\/sup> <\/i>gene encoding the &#945;3, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Using flow cytometry analysis, human B2M and HLA-A2.1 were detected in splenocytes of homozygous B-HLA-A2.1 mice but not in wild type mice. Mouse B2M was detectable in splenocytes of wild type mice but not in homozygous B-HLA-A2.1 mice. The percentage of T cells, B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells within the spleens of homozygous B-HLA-A2.1 mice were similar to those in the wild type mice, demonstrating that introduction of human B2M and HLA-A2.1 does not change the overall development, differentiation, or distribution of these cell types. Next, <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy evaluation of two peptide vaccines (V1 and V2) under development was performed with the humanized mice. Mice were inoculated with vaccines by intramuscular injections into the inner thigh (L and R) muscles and sacrificed three weeks after the last immunization. The splenocytes were extracted, stimulated with individual peptides, and measured for IFN-&#947; secretion. HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL responses of the vaccines were successfully detected in B-HLA-A2.1 mice, and no significant difference in body weight was observed among groups. Our results show that B-HLA-2.1 mice provide a powerful preclinical mouse model for <i>in vivo <\/i>evaluation of peptide vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b19c151b-48c6-4001-aabc-22bcfc67b3e4\/@x03B8ZC3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Vaccines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16636"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jiawei Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chengzhang Shang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Shivam Madaan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanhui Nie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Yang<\/i><\/presenter>.

One way to generate a holistic view of both human papillomavirus positive (HPV+) and negative (HPV-) HNC is to study the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Since HPV+ HNC often results in more favorable outcomes than HPV- HNC, assessing differences between these two disease states may provide critical mechanistic insight into what causes discrepancies in treatment response. This study uses publicly available and in-house collected single-cell transcriptome (scRNA-seq) data from preclinical murine models and human HNC to assess the differences between HPV+ and HPV- HNC TIME. Recent scRNA-Seq data showed extensive characterization of infiltrating T and B cells between HPV+ and HPV- HNC, but little is known about the myeloid compartment. As myeloid cells with both pro- and anti-tumoral functions make up a bulk of the HNC TIME, we sought to identify the differences in myeloid cells between HPV+ vs. HPV- HNC and their roles in response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. We identified higher myeloid heterogeneity than previously reported from both published and our generated scRNA-Seq. In human HNC patients, we identified four macrophage, seven monocyte, and five dendritic cell subsets. One macrophage subset expressed high levels of CXCL9 in both humans and our murine HNC model. Interestingly, recent studies identified CXCL9 as a biomarker for immunotherapy response. Observing conserved Cxcl9-expressing macrophages between murine and human HNC could help assess treatment response in cancer patients. We will assess the translational value of murine HPV+ and HPV- HNC models compared to their human counterparts. To this end, we are generating scRNA-Seq data from different HNC murine models: MOC1, MOC2, mEERL. The MOC2 and MOC1 cell lines recapitulate a responsive and non-responsive HPV- HNC tumor phenotype, respectively. The mEERL cell line recapitulates an HPV+ HNC phenotype. Our analysis shows high concordance between mouse models with immunological cold TIME (MOC2) and a proportion of human HNCs. We also identified changes in myeloid landscapes between immunological cold-to-hot TIME mice receiving ICI (anti-PD1 + anti-CTL4) therapies. We will present an in-depth comparative analysis to provide mechanistic insights into observed differences in the TIME between mice and humans. We will also present a novel bioinformatics analysis to interrogate how cell-cell signaling interactions between myeloid and T cell subsets influence their downstream gene regulatory network and tumor immune phenotypes. This analysis provides a reference for future studies in HNC immunology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/44056990-6d16-404c-8301-afebebe0b0f8\/@y03B8ZC4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Macrophages,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16638"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Athena E.

Current chemotherapeutic regimens poorly control PDAC progression, and immunotherapy has yet to be widely successful against PDAC. Obesity promotes a potently protumor PDAC microenvironment including suppression of antitumor immune response. The purpose of our studies was to test whether dietary supplementation with &#946;-hydroxy-&#946;-methylbutyrate (HMB), shown to be safe and well tolerated in cancer patients, could offset obesity-mediated exacerbation of PDAC and promote antitumor immunosurveillance.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Lean and obese C57BL\/6 mice were treated with HMB alone or in combination with anti-PD1 immunotherapy following subcutaneous injection of Panc02 PDAC cells. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were treated with HMB in vitro with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Tumor\/ macrophage transcriptomic analysis using Affymetrix arrays followed by gene set enrichment was performed, and tumor microenvironment immune cell composition was determined by mass cytometry.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: a) HMB cooperates with obesity and immunotherapy to reduce PDAC progression, as indicated by reduced tumor growth with the combination regimen of HMB + anti-PD1 relative to obese or anti-PD1 immunotherapy treated mice without HMB supplementation; b) HMB mitigates PDAC immunosuppression and promotes tumor immune surveillance, as demonstrated by induction of an antitumor immune-related gene expression profile in response to HMB supplementation; c) HMB promotes pro-inflammatory polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and BMDM, as shown by increased CD38 positivity and reduced Arg1 positivity in tumor-associated macrophages from HMB supplemented mice relative to control. Further, BMDM transcriptional response to HMB alone or HMB in combination with LPS paralleled that of BMDM treated with LPS relative to untreated LPS.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Overall, our findings suggest HMB is an adjuvant for antitumor immune responses in PDAC. Moreover, HMB promotes immune surveillance in PDAC, synergizing with immunotherapy. Hence, HMB-induced suppression of PDAC tumor growth and promotion of immune surveillance may offer significant synergy with chemotherapies or immunotherapies in PDAC.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Funding:<\/b> This work was supported by R35CA197627 to SDH.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d0e7820-1a97-47a7-b893-6cc2ee6e140d\/@y03B8ZC4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diet,Obesity,Immunomodulation,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16640"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael F.

CRD5500 is a small molecule STING agonist that has demonstrated excellent systemic tolerability in primate GLP toxicology studies and is scheduled for IND filing with the US FDA in the first half of 2022. The compound binds to STING at a unique location that is outside the dimeric cleft that is the natural ligand binding site<sup>2<\/sup>. While this first-in class agent cross-reacts with cynomolgus monkey STING and activates all five major variants of human STING with similar potency, it does not cross-react with rodent STING. Here we demonstrate the potent anti-tumor activity of CRD5500 administered intravenously in a range of immunologically cold murine tumors implanted in human STING knock-in mice.<br \/>Methods: The functional potency of STING across species was evaluated in STING over-expressing HEK293T cells and PBMCs. Human STING KI mice (Genoway) were used to monitor anti-tumor effects of CRD5500 dosed IV or IT against the following tumors: B16F10 (melanoma), PANO2 (pancreatic), C1498 (acute myeloid leukemia) and LL2 (lung). Intravenous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation was carried out in cynomolgus monkeys.<br \/>Results: CRD5500&#8217;s activated the different variants of human STING with EC50 values that ranged from 10-70 nM in an pIRF3 reporter assay. Treatment of hSTING transfected cells, human tumor cell lines or hPBMC with CRD5500 led to dose dependent activation of STING. Further, CRD5500 treatment of human DCs and PBMCs led to the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN&#946; and TNF&#945;. Intravenous administration of CRD5500 in human STING knock-in mice caused tumor regression in several cold tumor models such as B16F10, PANO2, LL2, C1498. Further, CRD5500 demonstrated the abscopal effect in B16F10 tumors when administered via intratumoral route. The compound was well tolerated at high doses in the primate GLP study when administered intravenously and caused dose and exposure dependent increases in CXCL10.<br \/>Conclusion: The ability of CRD5500 to generate impressive anti-tumor immune responses in cold tumors as a single agent coupled with its excellent IV safety profile in non-human primates make it well suited for FIH investigations planned for mid-2022 under a US FDA IND.<br \/>References: 1.
