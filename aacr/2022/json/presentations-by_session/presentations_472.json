[{"Abstract":"The efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in solid tumors is limited by inefficient T-cell infiltration, localization and hypofunctionality within the tumor microenvironment. Prior studies demonstrated that stromal cell targeted CAR T cells, in particular CAR T cells that target fibroblast activation protein (FAP), can effectively infiltrate, and inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) due to their capacity to deplete stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) that otherwise present a barrier to adoptive cell therapies. However, the kinetics of tumor infiltration by FAP-CAR T cells, and the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions that contribute to their anti-tumor activity are poorly understood. A better understanding FAP-CAR T-cell kinetics and intratumoral interactions should provide insights into the requirements for successful adoptive cell therapies in solid tumors. By combining immunostaining and real-time two-photon microscopy in tumor fragments of PDAC, we found that stromal cell targeted FAP-CAR T cells can efficiently traffic into tumors. Initially (days 1-3) FAP-CAR T cells were enriched in the stroma surrounding tumor nests but excluded from the tumor nests per se. While associated with the stroma rich region, the CAR T cells appeared activated and T cell motility was observed in loose collagen regions, but T cells migrated poorly in dense matrix areas. Aligned collagen fibers in the tumor boarder dictated the migratory trajectory of T cells and restricted them from entering tumor nests. By day 5 we observed depletion of immunosuppressive stromal cells, dissolution of the fibrillar collagen network surrounding tumor nests and infiltration of FAP-CAR T cells into tumor nests. Treatment with hyaluronidase increased the ability of T cells to infiltrate the tumor nest. Thus, FAP-CAR T cell-mediated ablation of immunosuppressive FAP<sup>+<\/sup> stromal cells and disruption of the desmoplastic stroma they generate, can enhance accumulation and functionality of CAR-T cell therapy in the context of highly desmoplastic solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b736afd3-8413-4bf2-b86b-7ffc2f4ea2f2\/@m03B8ZNf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-04 Imaging of molecular and cellular events in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Fibroblasts,Immune cells,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11362"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zebin Xiao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leslie A.

Tumoral mesenchymal transformation is a hallmark of GBMs associated with alterations in cellular morphology and dynamic organization. However, little is known about the mechanisms that control this pathological process. Here, we report a comprehensive spatiotemporal study integrating novel intra-tumoral histopathological structures, &#8216;oncostreams&#8217;, with tumor dynamic properties, microenvironment assets and spatial molecular features. Cellular analyses of genetic engineered mouse models of glioma identified that oncostreams are heterogenous structures formed by elongated and aligned neoplastic cells enriched in non-neoplastic cells such as ACTA2+ mesenchymal like cells and CD68+ tumor associated microglia\/macrophages (TAM). Deep learning analysis of H&#38;E glioma histological samples from mouse and human gliomas identified that oncostream density correlates with tumor aggressiveness. To determine whether oncostreams fascicles are characterized by a specific gene expression profile, we performed transcriptomic analysis using laser capture microdissection coupled to RNA-sequencing. We found that oncostreams are defined by a transcriptomic signature enriched in mesenchymal genes. Network analyses identified that COL1A1 is a critical gene that regulates oncostream organization and function. Correspondingly, human and mouse high-grade gliomas with high oncostream densities showed prominent alignment of collagen fibers along these fascicles and higher COL1A1 expression compared to low-grade gliomas. To evaluate the functional role of COL1A1 in oncostream formation we generated a COL1A1-deficient GEMM of glioma. We observed that COL1A1 inhibition decreased oncostream formation, impaired tumor cell proliferation and remodeled the tumor microenvironment by diminishing CD68+ TAM cells, CD31+ endothelial vascular proliferation and ACTA2+ perivascular mesenchymal cells, thus increasing animal survival. Further studies, using time lapse confocal imaging in ex vivo glioma explants, and intravital imaging in vivo demonstrated that oncostreams are organized collective dynamic structures present at the tumor core and the invasive tumor border. Oncostreams dynamics increased the intra-tumoral spread of cells within the tumor and foster glioma aggressiveness through collective invasion of the normal brain parenchyma. The analysis of glioma invasion in COL1A1 knockdown tumors exhibited a reduction in collective migration patterns, strongly supporting its importance in tumor progression. We propose that oncostreams represent a novel pathological marker of potential value for diagnosis and COL1A1 depletion within oncostreams is a promising approach and reprogram mesenchymal transformation to reduce the tumor malignancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/edcf6469-ac87-4229-b047-6054bf14c6d4\/@m03B8ZNf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-05 Imaging of molecular and cellular events in tumors and tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),Migration,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11364"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrea Comba<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Syed Faisal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick J.

To improve efficacy, a variety of combination therapies are being studied. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used as a biomarker to guide many of those therapies. Non-invasive evaluation of therapy induced changes in PD-L1 levels in the whole body could provide insights to guide those therapies. Here, we investigated the potential of [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222, a novel PD-L1 binding positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent, to quantify PD-L1 levels and pharmacodynamics in humanized mouse modes.<br \/>Methods: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma (UC) and melanoma cell lines were screened by flow cytometry (FC) for PD-L1 expression and density. In vitro cell uptake assays, in vivo PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies were used to evaluate the specificity of [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 to bind PD-L1 (n=5-6\/tumor). To quantify immunotherapy induced changes in PD-L1, A375 melanoma xenografts were inoculated in NSG mice humanized with CD34+ cells. Mice were treated with either 5 mg\/kg anti- PD-1; (pembrolizumab) or 5 mg\/kg of anti-PD-1 + 4 mg\/kg of anti- CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) (n=5) and [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 PET was acquired before and 7 days after start of treatment. Tumor growth was monitored. FC of tumors was performed to measure changes in TME and immune cell infiltrates.<br \/>Results: In vitro uptake of [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 in NSCLC (H244 &#62; H226 &#62; A549) and UC (BFTC909 &#62; T24 &#62; SCaBER) correlated with PD-L1 density (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.96). [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 PET and biodistribution studies in mice with NSCLC and UC xenografts revealed high and variable tumor uptake at 60 min, which was in agreement with PD-L1 levels detected by IHC. These data established sensitivity of [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 PET to quantify variable PD-L1 levels in vivo. We next sought to quantify therapy induced changes in PD-L1 levels. We observed higher [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 uptake in tumors of mice treated with combination therapy compared to monotherapy (1.83 vs 0.47 %ID\/cc). A significant delay in tumor growth was observed with combination therapy compared to monotherapy. Two out of five mice with highest increase in [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 uptake in combination therapy group exhibited least tumor growth. Also, final tumor volumes negatively correlated with [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 uptake (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.33) irrespective of treatment regimen. FC analysis showed higher immune infiltrates (1320 vs 230 per milligram of tumor), PD-L1+ cells (6005 vs 2739 \/mg) and ratio of CD8+ to CD4+ cells (1.94 vs 0.47) in tumors treated with combination therapy compared with monotherapy. These observations confirmed that immunotherapy induced changes in PD-L1 levels in tumors can be quantified using [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 PET.<br \/>Conclusion: [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 PET can effectively quantify variable PD-L1 levels in tumors. Moreover, [<sup>18<\/sup>F]DK222 PET exhibits the sensitivity to quantify PD-L1 pharmacodynamics to inform on tumor response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f647e77-a85e-4856-8773-dcb318d77cb5\/@m03B8ZNf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-06 Imaging the immune response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,PET,Tumor microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11365"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akhilesh Mishra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhiraj Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kuldeep Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick M.

HIF2a is constitutively activated following von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene inactivation, which is the signature event of the most common type of kidney cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). HIF2a functions as a heterodimeric transcription factor in partnership with the constitutive HIF1b subunit and regulates a program of gene expression that promotes cell proliferation, stemness, and angiogenesis. While as a transcription factor HIF2a had escaped drug targeting, structural studies revealed an unusual cavity, which became the foundation for the development of small molecule inhibitors such as PT2385 (a first-in-class drug), or the related PT2399 tool compound and the recently FDA-approved PT2977 (also called belzutifan). PT drugs bind a small pocket in the PAS-B domain of HIF2a inducing a conformational change that triggers dissociation from its obligatory partner HIF1b. PT drugs are highly specific - they do not bind the close paralog HIF1a and do not induce changes in gene expression in cells devoid of HIF2a. Using an extensive library of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we previously showed that PT drugs have activity against 50% of ccRCCs implanted in mice, and similar observations were made in the clinic. Perhaps unsurprisingly, sensitive tumors showed higher HIF2a levels. Here, we leverage the specificity of PT2385 to develop a HIF2a tracer for positron emission tomography (PET). By substituting a native fluorine atom for 18F, we generated [18F]PT2385. [18F]PT2385 was able to discriminate HIF2a-expressing ccRCCs from tumors that did not express HIF2a in mice simultaneously implanted with both. These data set the foundation for an investigator new drug (IND) approval from the FDA, and a clinical trial that is currently accruing patients (NCT04989959). [18F]PT2385 PET may have applications in identifying kidney cancer patients most likely to respond to HIF2a-targeted therapies, the identification of other tumors relying on HIF2a, and beyond oncology. Reporting on a hypoxia sensor, a HIF2a radiotracer may be a useful ischemia probe. In summary, we report the development of a novel radiotracer with extensive potential applications currently being evaluated in humans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3eada95e-6cb8-47b6-a71a-86f23f565aa5\/@m03B8ZNf\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-02 Application of imaging technology to the clinic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PET,Hypoxia-inducible factor,Clinical trial,Hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11366"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sashi Debnath<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Stevens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Brandenburg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Sovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paulina Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian (Janie) Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sydney Haldeman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanina Toffessi Tcheuyap<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alana Christie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pawan Thapa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ning Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aditi Mulgaonkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guiyang Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Miyata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deyssy Carrillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Cadeddu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Payal Kapur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jon Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Pedrosa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianna Dakanali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Orhan Oz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiankai Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Brugarolas<\/i><\/presenter>.

Total radiolabeled <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-BMS-986279 binding to intact DMS79 cells was &#8776;15-fold higher than to H520 control cells in vitro and was almost completely blocked by coincubation with a 1000-fold excess of BMS-986012.

While liquid biopsy may indicate the presence of cancer and possibly provide the tissue of origin, it cannot pinpoint the exact location of cancer and its metastases. Furthermore, current imaging techniques lack the sensitivity to locate early-stage tumors, diminishing the ability for early clinical intervention. Current imaging approaches using <sup>18<\/sup>F-FDG rely on increased metabolic rates of tumors vs. surrounding non-tumor tissue, often resulting in high background and inability to detect low-metabolic tumors. Earli is developing a highly sensitive, orthogonal approach that uses genetic constructs to usurp dysregulated cancer pathways to force the tumor to produce a synthetic biomarker used to detect and localize the malignancy. We previously demonstrated the utility of cancer-activated expression of blood-based biomarkers in preclinical cancer models, which are currently in an ongoing clinical study.<br \/>EARLI-201 is novel genetic imaging probe comprised of a DNA construct containing a cancer-activated promoter to drive the expression of a PET Reporter Gene (PRG). The HSV-sr39TK PRG product specifically sequesters the <sup>18<\/sup>F-FHBG tracer inside the cell, enabling detection by PET imaging. Initial studies for sensitivity combined H1299 lung cancer cells engineered with only two copies of the PRG were implanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice followed by the administration of the <sup>18<\/sup>F-FHBG tracer. Results demonstrate a robust signal from as few as 62,000 injected cells. Given that a 1 mm<sup>3<\/sup> tumor contains ~1,000,000 cells, suggests that we can localize tumors as small as 6.25mm<sup>3<\/sup> with only a 1% transfection efficiency. EARLI-201 was tested in a variety of murine models including the metastatic &#8220;Lung Trap&#8221; and spontaneous HCC-MYC\/Twist1, which produce discrete tumor nodules in the lungs or liver, respectively. A single intravenous injection of EARLI-201 given at Day 1 results in cancer-activated expression and accumulation of the PRG in tumors. <sup>18<\/sup>F-FHBG PET imaging three days post dosing revealed distinct tumor foci that co-register with tumors detected by CT. Additional <i>ex vivo<\/i> techniques confirmed PRG expression only in tumor-containing tissues and not in healthy tissue. Imaging the same animals with <sup>18<\/sup>F-FDG failed to produce any appreciable signal in the same tumors, likely because they are of low metabolic nature.<br \/>These pre-clinical results clearly demonstrate the potential of Earli&#8217;s approach to detect and localize very small tumors currently outside the sensitivity of existing imaging modalities. Additional experiments to evaluate EARLI-201 in companion dogs diagnosed with cancer are currently in progress and provides the ability to validate the platform in larger body masses with spontaneously formed tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/df47563a-84ae-4e1b-af41-f08d901d8968\/@m03B8ZNf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-01 Advanced nanotechnology and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,PET Imaging,Cancer activated gene expression,DNA nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11368"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Alex Harwig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morgan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ling Tong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Regina Nieu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vy Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dean Felsher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>David Suhy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Molecular imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) could fulfill an unmet need and enable an early diagnosis of PDAC to potentially improve survival. EphA2, a member of Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptors, plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenesis and development of an immune suppressive microenvironment in PDAC. We therefore developed a peptide-based PET imaging agent for EphA2, [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]AJ201, and evaluated its pharmacokinetics and potential to non-invasively quantify variable EphA2 expression in PDAC.<br \/>Methods: A Gallium-68 labeled EphA2 binding peptide, [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]AJ201, was synthesized in high radiochemical yields and purity. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was carried out to measure binding affinity. EphA2 expression was assessed in PDAC cell lines and tissues in CCLE and TCGA. EphA2 expression in seven PDAC cell lines (Panc1, AsPC1 BxPC3, CFPAC1, Hs766T, Panc1005, and SU8686) was validated by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry. Those cell lines were then used for <i>in vitro<\/i> binding assays and the corresponding xenografts in NSG mice for PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies (n=4-5\/tumor). Specificity of [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]AJ201 was confirmed by co-injection of a blocking dose of non-radioactive AJ201 (1 mg\/kg).<br \/>Results: SPR analysis showed that AJ201 binds EphA2 with a high affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub>) of 0.2 nM. TCGA analysis revealed higher expression of EphA2 in PDAC vs healthy tissues. Flow cytometry analysis revealed high and variable EphA2 expression in all the PDAC cell lines tested with Panc1 exhibiting the highest levels. <i>In vitro<\/i> binding assays showed high and variable [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]AJ201 uptake in all the PDAC cell lines and low uptake in the presence of 1&#181;M non-radioactive AJ201 and in EphA2 negative Jurkat cells. Pharmacokinetics of [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]AJ201 in mice with Panc1 tumors showed high contrast images of EphA2 expression at 60 minutes with a tumor\/muscle ratio of 25.9&#177;6.7. That high tumor uptake was significantly reduced in mice receiving blocking dose confirming the specificity of the radiotracer. Also, [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]AJ201 PET quantified variable EphA2 expression in all the seven PDAC xenografts tested, with highest uptake observed in Panc1 tumor, followed by SU8686, and lowest in CFPAC1. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> biodistribution studies corroborated PET imaging findings.<br \/>Conclusion: [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]AJ201 is a EphA2 specific high affinity peptide-based PET imaging agent that provides high contrast PET images of PDAC by 60 minutes. [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]AJ201 PET has the potential to non-invasively detect PDAC in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/56c97642-1d83-4ba1-b0c7-c58b81b95526\/@n03B8ZNg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-03 Imaging in animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,EphA2,Imaging,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11369"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kuldeep Gupta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Kumar Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akhilesh Mishra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia Y.

While first generation STING agonists have advanced to multiple clinical trials, their application is restricted to intratumoral administration and these agents have shown limited therapeutic efficacy. In contrast, recently developed second generation STING agonists allow for systemic administration and have been shown to exert highly potent anti-tumor effects in animal models of cancer. However, STING is expressed in a wide array of cell types and tissues, and the effects of systemic activation of this pattern recognition receptor are poorly understood. This highlights the need for the development of pharmacodynamic companion biomarkers that can be used to guide the clinical development of newly developed systemic STING agonists. Here, we show that systemic administration of the STING agonist diABZI triggers alterations in glucose metabolism in immune cells which can be detected non-invasively using [<sup>18<\/sup>F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET). Accordingly, systemic STING activation significantly upregulated [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FDG uptake in secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and lymph nodes, as indicated by PET imaging <i>in vivo<\/i> and confirmed by gamma counter measurements of isolated splenocytes <i>ex vivo<\/i>. Importantly, STING agonist-induced changes in [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FDG uptake in the spleen and lymph nodes were highly predictive of therapeutic responses to STING agonist mono- and combination therapies in animal models of pancreatic cancer. Using single-cell RNA sequencing we found that systemic STING activation triggers profound transcriptional alterations in T and B lymphocytes indicative of a metabolic shift towards enhanced glycolysis. We then explored whether metabolic alterations indicated by increased [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FDG uptake are associated with changes in the functional phenotypes of T and B cells. We found that systemic STING activation induced the upregulation of the early activation marker CD69 and immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1. Furthermore, CD69 and PD-L1 upregulation occurred in a STING agonist dose-dependent manner that correlated with [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FDG uptake as measured non-invasively by PET. In interferon receptor knockout mice, CD69 and PD-L1 expression was partially attenuated; however, [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FDG uptake was still induced following STING activation, suggesting that an interferon-independent mechanism mediates the observed glycolytic switch in lymphocytes. In summary, [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FDG-PET provides a novel non-invasive and widely applicable pharmacodynamic biomarker which has potential to guide and accelerate the clinical development of systemic STING agonist-based immunotherapies in immunologically cold malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2ba57fa8-b087-494a-83e3-29bcec66a17f\/@n03B8ZNg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-06 Imaging the immune response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Immune response,Glucose metabolism,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11371"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hailey R.

Additionally, resistance to AVA therapy is nearly ubiquitous given the occurrence of metabolic adaptations such as a dependence on glutamine metabolism via the enzyme glutaminase.<br \/><b>Objectives<\/b><b>:<\/b> To examine the metabolic vulnerability of AVA-resistant cancer with glutaminase inhibitor (GLSi) therapy and to test the utility of hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HP-MRS) for assessing changes in lactate metabolism associated with GLSi treatment following injection of hyperpolarized [1-<sup>13<\/sup>C] pyruvate.<br \/><sup> <\/sup> <b>Methods:<\/b><i> <\/i>We used a well-characterized SKOV3ip1 orthotopic mouse model of high-grade serous ovarian cancer with adaptive resistance to AVA (bevacizumab) treatment. Following three weeks of GLSi and bevacizumab treatment, we performed HP-MRS imaging to directly and non-invasively compare metabolic changes between the treatment groups of bevacizumab monotherapy versus a combined treatment of bevacizumab plus GLSi therapy. Upon injection of hyperpolarized [1-<sup>13<\/sup>C] pyruvate, we quantitatively assessed a normalized lactate ratio (nLac), defined as the <sup>13<\/sup>C resonance signal of lactate divided by the sum of the pyruvate and lactate signals, sixty seconds after injection. GLSi treatment effect was subsequently compared between GLSi monotherapy, bevacizumab monotherapy and control mice receiving no therapy. This was performed via gross necropsy to assess disease burden and quantification of tumor weight and nodule number.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><i> <\/i>Significance analysis microarrays (SAM) of bevacizumab treated tumors from the mouse models revealed greater glutamine and glutamate abundance in all tissues suggestive of a glutamine dependence in AVA resistant tumors that could be susceptible to glutaminase inhibition. The <i>in vivo<\/i> HP-MRS provided a direct and non-invasive investigation of pyruvate metabolism of tumors in situ. Our analysis indicated that the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion was significantly reduced <i>in vivo<\/i> by GLSi treatment (0.337 vs 0.178, <i>p<\/i>=0.0002), suggestive of therapeutic efficacy of GLSi in the setting of AVA-resistant tumors. Consistent with this, we observed a statistically significant reduction in tumor weight (0.05g vs 0.62g and 0.64g, p&#60;0.01) and tumor nodule number (n=3.3 vs n=12.8 and n=13.9, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05) in mice treated with a combination of bevacizumab and GLSi compared to the control group, or GLSi monotherapy, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<i> <\/i><\/b>Using HP-MRS <i>in vivo,<\/i> we directly monitored metabolic changes occurring after GLSi treatment. These findings are consistent with the notion of glutamine dependence being an important resistance mechanism to AVA therapy and imply potential future use of HP-MRS in monitoring therapeutic efficacy in a clinical realm.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/90d4ca58-2300-410d-bda2-837b3ca47df3\/@n03B8ZNg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-07 Imaging tumor metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glutamine metabolism,Magnetic resonance spectroscopy,Antiangiogenic therapy,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11372"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"e957fad2-eaff-474b-bb44-e7b5397d86b0","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e957fad2-eaff-474b-bb44-e7b5397d86b0\/@n03B8ZNg\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Deanna Glassman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark S.

Existing models being used to study breast cancer include the Patient-Derived Tumor Organoid (PDTO) Model and the Patient-Derived Tumor Xenograft (PDTX) Model. Both models involve the surgical removal of a tumor from a patient which then undergoes processing to grow an organoid or injected into mice to test different therapies outside the body. However, these models not only take a considerable amount of time to develop properly, but in many cases aren&#8217;t representative of the most aggressive tumor cells present within a heterogeneous tissue sample in order to draw the most clinically accurate conclusions of a tumor's response to therapy. In order to advance clinical research, more efficient culture systems that are faster growing and more representative of biological characteristics<i> <\/i><i>in-vivo <\/i>are needed. Previous work from the Karczmar Lab discovered that high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect regions of aggressive cancer in biopsy specimens from mouse models, and give additional information on characteristics including cell density, tissue composition, and cancer stage. With this recent discovery, it is hypothesized that<i> <\/i><i>ex-vivo <\/i>imaging could be used to identify aggressive tumor cells in human heterogeneous breast cancer tissue samples to produce higher quality and faster-growing models for testing new therapies and guiding individual patient therapy for breast cancer. The primary aim for this study was to specifically identify image-based markers for regions of aggressive cancer by comparing<i> <\/i><i>ex-vivo <\/i>high-resolution MRI with histology and immunohistochemistry in 3D. Distant normal (DN) and tumor (Tu) tissue samples from breast cancer patients were obtained and imaged using T2-weighted 3D Rapid Imaging with Refocused Echoes (RARE) and stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E), commonly used by pathologists to diagnose cancers. Then, the<i> <\/i><i>ex-vivo <\/i>T2-weighted 3D RARE images were correlated to the histopathological H&#38;E staining and confirmed by breast radiologists and pathologists. Preliminary results revealed that high-resolution MR imaging detects mammary glands, ducts, and white adipose tissue in DN tissue samples and regions of invasive cancer, including ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) and necrosis, in Tu tissue. Based on these results, aggressive cancer regions were proven to be identified using image-based guidance and potentially be extracted using core-needle biopsy to improve PDTO and PDTX models for studying breast cancer and advancing individual patient therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0b6268d6-7199-4e72-968f-096ef7bd1d26\/@n03B8ZNg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-08 New targets for imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Imaging,Early detection,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11373"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Corazon Avila<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Karczmar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Devkumar Mustafi<\/i><\/presenter>.

To monitor T cell infiltration and brain tumor growth <i>in vivo <\/i>in real time, we performed intravital microscopy of adoptively transferred and endogenous T cells in mouse models of intracranial melanoma. By spatio-temporal analysis of T cell infiltration dynamics in brain tumors we could identify a distinct type of venous blood vessels in the tumor vicinity, &#8220;peritumoral venous vessels&#8221; (PVVs). Intraluminal T cell attachment and T cell extravasation was increased at PVVs compared to intratumoral vessels. Moreover, PVVs were characterized by high perivascular T cell density, high T cell motility parameters and high expression of ICAM-1. PVVs were specifically exploited for the recruitment of T cells to melanoma brain tumors, whereas alternative T cell routes via brain structures such as brain capillaries, intratumoral blood vessels and parasagittal regions were not observed. Immune checkpoint inhibition increased T cell motility in the brain, facilitating the advance from PVV to tumor, which resulted in intracranial tumor growth inhibition.
