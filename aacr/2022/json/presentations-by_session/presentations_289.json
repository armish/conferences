While genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have contributed widely to our understanding of the underlying genetics and molecular mechanisms of the disease, major limitations exist. Most models of CRC lack flexibility to initiate focal adenocarcinomas with different genetic perturbations within the native microenvironment of the distal colon. Specifically, no autochthonous model of metastatic CRC compatible with <i>in vivo<\/i> CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering has been described. Therefore, we developed a novel split Cre-recombinase system restricting activation of oncogenic <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> and deletion of the tumor suppressor gene (TSG) <i>Trp53<\/i> to Lgr5<sup>+<\/sup> stem cells of the colon crypts. Importantly, these events are not only critical drivers of CRC progression and metastasis in mice and humans but can also lead to non-specific transformation of the surrounding colonic stroma. By expressing one half of Cre from the endogenous <i>Lgr5 <\/i>locus and other half via colonoscopy-guided submucosal injection of lentivirus, we restricted Cre-mediated recombination to enterocytes. Lentivirus was also engineered to express a single guide RNA (sgRNA) against <i>Apc<\/i>, facilitating tumor initiation via deletion of this critical CRC TSG in mice expressing Cas9. A second sgRNA was included to facilitate rapid interrogation of putative cancer driver genes. As proof-of-principle, we targeted <i>Smad4<\/i>, a critical suppressor of metastasis in CRC, and observed adenocarcinoma formation and liver metastases with complete recombination and editing of all targeted genes. To prioritize candidate TSGs for future <i>in vivo<\/i> interrogation, we applied MutSigCV to large human sequencing datasets and identified genes significantly co-mutated with <i>APC<\/i> and <i>KRAS<\/i> in CRC. Altogether, this faithful and tractable model of CRC can be used for rapid functional interrogation of TSGs and should accelerate downstream mechanistic and preclinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Tumor suppressor gene,Colorectal cancer,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Westcott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santiago Naranjo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haley Hauck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Rideout<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nate Sacks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arjun Bhutkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Patten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norihiro Goto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Sedlak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tyler Jacks<\/i><\/presenter>.

As RAS mutations could arise from selection of an ideal level (quantitative) or type (qualitative) of oncogenic signaling, we generated four conditional <i>Kras<\/i> alleles with different oncogenic mutations, G<sub>12<\/sub>D or Q<sub>61<\/sub>R, coded with native rare or common codons to induce low or high protein expression to separate these two types of signaling. These alleles were crossed into a <i>Rosa26-CreER<\/i> background and globally activated, revealing tissues sensitive to quantitative signaling regulated by the RAS biochemical activity, qualitative signaling regulated by the specific mutation, and either both or none of these two types of signaling. Bulk RNAseq analysis further revealed that each allele induced a different cellular response, with the weakest allele induce transcriptional features of a plastic state while the strongest allele had all the transcriptional hallmarks of high oncogenic signaling and a stress response. In conclusion, this approach provides a mutational atlas of tissues dependent upon quantitative signaling, qualitative signaling, or both forms of signaling for tumorigenesis, as well as tissues generally resistant to oncogenic RAS. This tissue atlas can thus serve to define how specific cancers are initiated, and in turn, how to prevent such initiation events from taking hold to lead a normal cell down the path of tumorigenesis, which has important clinical implications for early cancer detection and prevention measures.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras oncogene,Tumorigenesis,KRAS,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ozgun Erdogan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Counter<\/i><\/presenter>.

While molecular characterization of tens of thousands of primary tumors has solidified estimates of how frequently specific genomic alterations occur, identifying genetic interactions from co-mutation rates alone remains limited by the vast number of possible combinations as well as inherent biases and confounding effects. Conversely, genetically engineered mouse models can reliably uncover causal effects of specific genetic alterations but are not sufficiently high throughput to generate broad insights into the interplay between genetic alterations in tumors. Therefore, how the effects of one alteration on tumor growth change in the context of other alterations remains largely unknown. We previously addressed these technical limitations by combining CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated gene editing, tumor barcoding, and ultra-deep barcode sequencing methods with genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer, which together enable multiplexing of tumor genotypes in individual mice and precise, high-throughput quantification of <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor fitness. Here, we leverage this platform to systematically quantify the growth effects of over 45 known and putative tumor suppressor gene alterations across different common oncogenic point mutations in <i>Kras<\/i> and <i>Braf<\/i>.<br \/>While the set of genes we identified as tumor suppressive in Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>- and Kras<sup>G12C<\/sup>-driven lung cancers was largely consistent, inactivation of those genes typically resulted in larger tumor growth advantages in the Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> model. Inactivation of most genes in Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>-driven lung tumors had a strikingly different growth effect than in tumors with either Kras<i> <\/i>variant, and effects were generally far less pronounced in the Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup> context. Interestingly, loss of genes upstream of Braf within the Ras pathway often had strong effects in the <i>Kras<\/i><i><sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> or <i>Kras<\/i><i><sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>models&#8212;loss of Nf1, a negative regulator of Kras, or loss of the wildtype Kras allele enhanced oncogenic Kras-driven tumor growth, while loss of Shp2, a positive regulator of Kras, was mildly detrimental&#8212;but had little or no effects in the Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup> model.<br \/>We assessed translatability of our experimental cause-and-effect data through comparisons to correlative data from publicly available human lung cancer genomics databases, and found that genetic interactions predicted by our models and gene co-mutation rates in patient tumors largely align. Together, these findings underscore the need for a contextual understanding of the ways in which tumors are influenced by their genetics and highlight the utility of high-throughput, quantitative autochthonous mouse models in pursuing this endeavor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,KRAS,BRAF,Tumor suppressor gene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ian Winters<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lily Blair<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lafia Sebastian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriel Grenot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edwin Apilado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wensheng Nie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vy Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Lai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Wall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitri Petrov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monte Winslow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Juan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Rosen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Using these models, it was uncovered that APOBEC3B expression is detrimental at tumor initiation when expressed continuously in a p53 wildtype background. This detrimental effect is likely due to elevated chromosomal instability, which was observed to increase significantly with APOBEC3B expression in an EGFR mutant TP53 deficient mouse model. Induction of subclonal expression of APOBEC3B in an EGFR mutant mouse model with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy resulted in a significant increase in resistant tumor development. Significant downregulation of the base excision repair gene uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) was also observed in APOBEC3B expressing mice, which paralleled findings in patient tumors and cell lines treated with TKI therapy. Finally, a mouse mutational signature was identified in APOBEC3B expressing cell lines, reinforcing the idea that APOBEC driven mutagenesis contributes to TKI resistance.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study demonstrates a unique principle by which targeted therapy induces changes within tumors ideal for APOBEC driven tumor evolution, fueling therapy resistance.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Lung adenocarcinoma,Mouse models,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Manasi Mayekar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Deborah Caswell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Vokes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily K.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of thousands of human tumors have revealed &#8220;mutational signatures&#8221; that provide a molecular footprint of cancer origins. Whether such signatures exist for modifiable cancer risk factors remains unclear. We studied the impact of lifestyle risk factors using a compendium of 107 mouse tumors that model obesity, high fat diet, wounding, chronic inflammation, or chemotherapy. We used a well-established 2-step skin carcinogenesis model composed of exposure to mutagen DMBA followed by tumor promoter TPA, generating squamous carcinomas that were analysed by WGS for identification of mutational signatures. In addition to recapitulating many COSMIC human signatures, we identified a novel SNV signature induced by a single treatment with DMBA (SBS.DMBA) which explains the majority of all detected mutations. While a single exposure of normal skin to DMBA induces a highly variable number of carcinogen-specific mutations, a very high mutation burden is insufficient for tumorigenesis. SNVs attributable to reactive oxygen species (ROS) are broadly found in about 25% of all mouse tumors, but are most prominent in tumors from mice that are exposed to DMBA in utero, suggesting that the developmental age of mutagen exposure may impact the repair of ROS generated mutations and that the timing of exposure is a poorly understudied component of carcinogenesis. In mouse tumor models of genetic and dietary obesity, the total mutational load and mutational signatures in tumors from obese mice were indistinguishable from those of lean mice despite dramatic differences in tumor latency and progression as well transcriptomic differences in immune activation. We found an enrichment in deleterious <i>Tgfrb2<\/i> mutations in tumors from mice with low compared to high body mass index (BMI) (p&#60;0.016). Using a conditionally activated RAS mouse model, we also show that a non-mutagenic inflammatory signal such as a chronic wound can act as the rate-limiting step for full tumor development. Surprisingly these tumors can be evoked even in somatic genomes with very few mutations apart from the initiating Ras driver. Finally, together with the Riva et al study, these chemically induced mouse tumors recapitulate &#62;50% of established human cancer driver genes. DMBA caused 91% of all <i>Hras\/Kras<\/i> mutations, but only a minority of other recurrent driver mutations in genes such as <i>Trp53<\/i> and Tert, suggesting that these occur later during the process of carcinogenesis. Taken together, we have analyzed the largest compendium of WGS data from nearly 300 mouse tumors, showing that while exogenous promotional factors do not increase mutation burden or induce novel mutational patterns, they have a major rate-limiting role in determining cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Mutations,Carcinogenesis,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yun Rose Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Halliwill<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eve Kandyba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reyno Delrosario<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quan Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nora Bayani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Di Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Mirzoeva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa McCreery Reeves<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mishu Islam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Riva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Bergstrom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Digiovanni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludmil Alexandrov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allan Balmain<\/i><\/presenter>.

In some individuals, this inflammation can cause gastric atrophy, metaplasia (conversion of one normal cell type to another), dysplasia (presence of abnormal cells) and finally cancer, but the specific mechanism(s) through which Hp triggers this cascade are not well understood. Similar preneoplastic changes are recapitulated in a mouse model through tamoxifen-induced expression of active KRAS in the chief cells of the stomach (KRAS+ mice). We found that Hp infection of KRAS+ mice exacerbated disease: compared to Hp-KRAS+ mice, Hp+KRAS+ mice had an altered trajectory of metaplasia and accelerated dysplasia. In accordance with the hypothesis that Hp causes cancer through eliciting chronic inflammation, Hp+KRAS+ mice had severe inflammation marked by a ten-fold increase in T cells compared to Hp-KRAS+ mice. To understand gene expression changes in gastric cells in the context of metaplasia with and without active Hp infection, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on eight mouse stomachs (+\/- Hp, +\/- KRAS) using the 10x Chromium platform. Cluster analyses followed by UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) visualization allowed us to identify 25 clusters, including epithelial and immune cell types. Hp+KRAS+ mice had a striking expansion of a population of metaplastic cells (most similar to surface mucus-producing &#8220;pit&#8221; cells), which comprised ~40% of epithelial cells in these mice. Metaplastic pit cells expressed markers of intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer, and their abundance in the stomach was correlated with helper T cell abundance. Analysis of RNA velocity suggested that metaplastic pit cells arose from a progenitor cell type, rather than arising from pit cells directly. As well, a 10x Visium spatial gene expression experiment revealed the spatial organization of metaplastic pit cells near the lumen of the gastric epithelium. Finally, antibiotic eradication of Hp prevented metaplastic pit cell development and other disease phenotypes. Taken together, these studies provide new understanding of how Hp infection and inflammation cause gastric preneoplastic progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Helicobacter pylori,Gastric cancer,Single cell,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Valerie Phoebe O'Brien<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William C.

Single-cell analysis of a cohort of late stage castration-resistant human prostate cancers (CRPC) revealed a greater degree of plasticity than previously appreciated, with multiple distinct neuroendocrine (NEPC), mesenchymal (EMT-like), and other subpopulations detected within single biopsies. To explore the steps responsible for initiation of this process, we utilized two genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer that recapitulate progression from adenocarcinoma to neuroendocrine disease. Time course studies reveal expansion of stem-like luminal epithelial cells (<i>Sca1<\/i>+, <i>Psca<\/i>+, called L2) that, based on trajectories, gave rise to at least 4 distinct subpopulations, NEPC (<i>Ascl1<\/i>+), POU2F3 (<i>Pou2f3<\/i>+), TFF3 (<i>Tff3<\/i>+) and EMT-like (<i>Vim<\/i>+, <i>Ncam1<\/i>+). Such populations are also seen in human prostate and small cell lung cancers. Furthermore, transformed L2-like cells express stem-like and gastrointestinal endoderm-like transcriptional programs, indicative of reemerging developmental plasticity programs, as well as elevated Jak\/Stat, interferon, and FGF pathways. Strikingly pharmacologic inhibition of Jak\/Stat and FGFR results in reversal of plasticity states and subsequent sensitivity to androgen receptor inhibitors (ARSIs). In sum, while the magnitude of multilineage heterogeneity, both within and across patients, raises considerable treatment challenges, the identification of highly plastic luminal cells as the likely source of this heterogeneity provides a target for more focused therapeutic intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Single cell,Human,Retinoblastoma protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samir Zaidi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jimmy Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roudier Martine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristine Wadosky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anuradha Gopalan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wouter Karthaus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Watson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lawrence True<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Nelson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Howard Scher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Morris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Haffner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Goodrich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dana Pe'er<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Sawyers<\/i><\/presenter>.
