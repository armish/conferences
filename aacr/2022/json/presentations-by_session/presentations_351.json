[{"Abstract":"Obesity-associated chronic inflammation and adipokine increase the cancer risk through promotion of tumor growth and malfunction of immune cells. Leptin, an adipokine abundantly found in obesity, is positively correlated with PD-1 expression and up-regulation of PD-1 on immune cells leads to immune cell exhaustion. PD-1 blockade (checkpoint inhibitor) has shown promising anti-tumor efficacy in patients with obesity through direct effects on the up-regulated PD-1. However, there are still need for improving the response rate and the efficacy of PD-1 blockage. In our previous study, we have verified that prohibitin binding peptide (PBP) inhibits glucose metabolism of cancer cells, resulting in alterations in pro-tumor tumor microenvironment (TME) to pro-immune TME. The pro-immune TME reinvigorates anti-cancer activity of immune cells and results in better suppression of tumor growth. Based these findings, we hypothesized that PBP would improve the anti-cancer effect of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor on cancer with obesity. Melanoma was embedded in lean or obese mice, then the mice were assigned to one of following groups: i) PBS, ii) PBP, iii) anti-PD-1 antibody (aPD-1) and iv) combination of PBP and aPD-1 (PBP+aPD-1). The PBP+aPD-1 group showed improved anti-cancer efficacy in tumor-bearing obese mice (not in lean mice) compared to single aPD-1 injection. Immune cells in PBP+aPD-1 injected obese mice showed the more activated characteristics in terms of its cytokine secretion and phenotype. In addition, the serum leptin level was decreased upon PBP treatment, indicating that the PBP-mediated decrease in the serum leptin level attributed the rejuvenation of immune cells through the balanced PD-1 expression on immune cells. PBP improves the anti-cancer efficacy of aPD-1 on tumor with obesity through recovering anti-cancer activity of immune cells that is driven, at least in part, by a decrease in the glucose metabolism of cancer cells and the circulating leptin levels. Consequently, combination of PBP and aPD-1 would have the great potential to treat cancer patients with obesity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/74328ac8-973e-4f09-bc23-f93b33578075\/@w03B8ZDT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synergism,PD-1 blockade,Peptides,Obesity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12211"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seungmin Han<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelsey E.

Among the tight junction proteins, claudin-3 (CLDN3) is overexpressed in many types of solid cancers, such as breast, ovarian, colorectal, and gastric cancers. Although CLDN3 can be potential therapeutic target due to the overexpression in various types of cancers, high homology with other CLDN family members is a hurdle to develop antibodies specifically targeting CLDN3. In this study, human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (ABN501) against CLDN3 was developed by scFv phage display using CLDN3-overexpressing stable cells and CLDN3-embedded lipoparticles as antigens. It was confirmed that ABN501 specifically bound to human and mouse CLDN3 without cross-reactivity to other CLDN family members. Sub-nanomolar affinity in binding kinetics of ABN501 was measured in CLDN3 expressing cell lines. We observed the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of ABN501 with human NK cells expressing CD16a (NK-92MI-CD16a), in various cancer cell lines according to CLDN3 expression levels. We also confirmed that ABN501 specifically targeted CLDN3-expressing tumors in biodistribution assay using fluorescence-conjugated ABN501. In addition, ABN501 showed anti-tumor effects when treated with NK-92MI-CD16a in xenograft mice bearing CLDN3 expressing tumors. Taken these results together, we suggest that ABN501, specifically recognizing to CLDN3, can be used as therapeutic agents for CLDN3 positive cancer, and developed in many different forms to treat cancers with its specificity for cancer diagnosis, antibody-drug conjugates, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7fcbdd67-9b7b-482f-9922-4f0ecfc59dcf\/@w03B8ZDT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human monoclonal antibodies,Tight junctions,Antitumor activity,Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12206"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hong-Seok Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Euni Sim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Jin Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sae Hyung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hayeon Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hobin Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiwon Jo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myeung-Ryun Seo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heegeon Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Hye Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sungyoul Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Kee Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jun-Young Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

While there are hundreds of T cell engagers (TCEs) in development, there is only one approved and marketed CD3-binding TCE. The high rate of attrition is largely attributable to dose-limiting toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, due in part to the small pool of high affinity CD3-binding antibodies that are commonly used. The discovery of safe and effective TCEs is limited because diverse panels of parental CD3 antibodies are hard to produce, the pairing of parentals is hard to perfect, and the sheer complexity and volume of data is hard to action. In this study, we will present a panel of functionally diverse, fully human CD3-binding parental antibodies. We will present data characterizing the diversity of our panel across multiple parameters, including sequence diversity, CD3 affinity, epitope binding, T cell activation, cytokine release, and tumor cell killing. Using OrthoMab<sup>TM<\/sup>, our clinically-validated bispecific engineering platform, allows this panel to be tested with a series of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) in a matrix format. Results from high-throughput production and characterization of bispecific antibodies will be presented. These multidimensional datasets of TCE composition and function allow for the identification of pairs that are optimal candidates for clinical development. This work will show how the diversity of our CD3-binding panel, combined with a robust bispecific protein engineering technology, can be used to quickly assess large and diverse TAA-binding panels discovered through our technology stack. An integrated workflow that doubles the data with diverse panels of parentals, assembles stable, safe, and manufacturable TCEs, and visualizes multidimensional datasets are critical to successfully identifying lead therapeutic candidates to bring the next generation of cancer therapies to patients sooner.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49f54264-1ccf-445f-95da-6c67d5cf1aac\/@w03B8ZDT\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Bispecific antibody,CD3,Antibody discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12214"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lindsay DeVorkin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim M.

Due to its ubiquitous nature, MIF can be considered as an inappropriate target for therapeutic intervention. However, we discovered oxidized MIF (oxMIF) as the disease-related isoform of MIF, which is specifically present in tumor tissue (Schinagl A et al., 2016). A 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation anti-oxMIF monoclonal antibody (mAb) demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and efficacy signal in a phase 1 clinical trial (Mahalingam D et al., 2020). Two bioengineered 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation anti-oxMIF mAbs with highly improved biophysicochemical and biological properties were generated and compared to the 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation anti-oxMIF mAb. Both bioengineered mAbs share identical variable domains, but distinct heavy-chain constant regions, to increase effector functions and efficacy of the therapeutic mAb ON203 and to reduce interactions with Fc&#947;Rs for the radio diagnostic mAb ON102.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Hydrophobicity and stability were determined by HIC and SEC. ADCC and ADCP activity were investigated by reporter and PBMC-mediated cell killing assays. Tumor penetration was assessed using IRDye 800CW or Zr<sup>89<\/sup>-labeled mAb in tumor-bearing Balb\/c or Balb\/c nude mice. PK and bioavailability were assessed in Balb\/c nude mice. Efficacy was determined in PC3 xenograft models in NMRI nude mice.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Bioengineering significantly reduced hydrophobicity of ON203 and ON102, leading to improved stability and strongly reduced aggregation but retaining the low nM affinity for oxMIF. This further resulted in a two-fold improved bioavailability and tumor accumulation after 24-48h and a three-fold enhanced retention on day 7 in mice harboring solid tumors of the colon, when compared to the 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation anti-oxMIF mAb. In contrast to previously described anti-oxMIF reference, ON203 and ON102 did not mediate any unspecific release of MCP-1, IL-6, or TNF-&#945; from PBMCs. Reporter and PBMC-mediated cell killing assays proved ADCC activity of ON203 with EC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.1-0.8 nM and ADCP activity with EC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 2.3 nM, whereas the 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation anti-oxMIF mAb was at least 10-fold less potent. Our findings for ON203 translated into abolishment of tumor growth in NMRI nude mice harboring human PC3 prostate cancer cells, showing superior efficacy compared to the 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation anti-oxMIF mAb.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> ON203 has a high potential to significantly improve efficacy compared to the 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation anti-oxMIF mAb, with Zr<sup>89<\/sup>-ON102 as companion diagnostic for patient stratification. We aim to develop these anti-oxMIF mAbs together for clinical use to create new treatment options for patients with solid tumors, with a clear rationale to combine ON203 with other immunotherapies or checkpoint inhibitors (Noe and Mitchell, 2020).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ebae207e-140c-4008-83ea-a3a2219fffbe\/@w03B8ZDT\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Microenvironment,Radioimmune diagnostic,Theranostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12208"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander Schinagl<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Thiele<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irina Mirkina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregor Rossmueller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandro A.

However, clinical development of cyclic-dinucleotide (CDN) STING agonists is mostly limited to intratumoral administration because of the undesirable pharmacological properties of CDN. This limits their applications in treating metastasis, hematologic malignancies, and hard-to-reach solid tumor. Here, we aim to develop a pharmacological formulation that facilitate systemic delivery of CDN STING agonist to broaden its applications for cancer treatment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Nutritional metal ions physiologically mediate various immune processes, which could potentially be utilized for modulating the STING pathway. By screening different nutritional metal ions, we discovered manganese ion (Mn<sup>2+<\/sup>) and cobalt ion (Co<sup>2+<\/sup>) synergize with CDN STING agonists and significantly enhance type-I interferon (IFN-I) responses.

In addition, Mn<sup>2+<\/sup> interact with CDNs and self-assemble into nanocrystals that could be stabilized as uniform nanoparticles (~120 nm) through lipid layer coating (CDN-Mn Particle, CMP). After either intratumoral or intravenous administrations, CMP effectively elevate the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-&#946;, TNF-&#945;, CXCL-9, and CXCL-10), mitigates the suppressive functions of myeloid cells, relieve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and induce antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expansion. Minute dose of CMP given intravenously exert remarkable antitumor efficacy in CT26, B16F10, and immune checkpoint blocker (ICB)-resistance tobacco-associated NOOC1 murine tumor models, leading to efficient tumor regression. Furthermore, the systemic biodistribution of CMP could be modulated by changing the composition of the lipid layer coating, allowing for organ-specific delivery of CMP to target tumor malignancies in certain organs.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> CMP provides a novel and versatile platform for local and systemic cancer treatment.

B7H3 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, but the protein is expressed at low levels, suggesting a tight post-transcriptional regulation. By contrast, B7H3 protein is overexpressed in several solid tumors and often correlates with poor survival, higher tumor grade, and metastasis independently of immune regulation. A few studies also have reported an association between B7H3 overexpression and therapy resistance. Since B7H3 protein is preferentially expressed on cancer cells and tumor vasculature, it is an attractive target for developing novel cancer therapies.<br \/>Here we analyzed the expression of B7H3 in 26 mCRPC organoid models and examined whether B7H3 can serve as a novel therapeutic target for advanced mPCa patients that fail current treatment regimens. The B7H3 protein expression in PDXOs of various lineages including adenocarcinoma (n=19), double-negative (DNPC, n= 2), and neuroendocrine (NE, n =5) lineages, was analyzed using simple western&#8482; assay, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. We tested the ex-vivo drug response of PDXOs and performed PDX preclinical trials using humanized B7H3-ADC armed with a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) warhead. PBD dimers are DNA interstrand cross-linking agents and are a poor substrate of P-gp drug transporters.<br \/>Our results showed that B7-H3 was overexpressed in several PDX derived organoids of mPCa. Organoids with adenocarcinoma phenotype (n=19) demonstrated a range of B7H3 protein expression whereas RB1\/TP53 mutated small cell neuroendocrine or double negative prostate cancer showed a relatively more uniform and low expression. Nonetheless, PDXOs of neuroendocrine, double negative or adenocarcinoma origin responded with maximum efficacy to B7H3-ADC ex vivo. Adenocarcinoma organoid models (n=19) displayed a wide range of responses, which was only partially correlated with B7H3 protein levels. Genetically-engineered loss of B7-H3 converted a responder to a non-responder phenotype. Our investigation for potential biomarkers of B7H3-PBD sensitivity suggested that RB1-deficiency induced replication stress and\/or expression of SLFN11, an interferon pathway transcriptional target, to be the strong predictors of B7H3-PBD response, independent of tumor lineage. We further performed preclinical trials using four PDX models based on their RB1 and SLFN11 status, including a model of advanced adenocarcinoma lineage with low B7H3 expression. B7H3-PBD eradicated large established subcutaneous tumors and metastases and improved long-term overall survival in either RB1 deficient and\/or SLFN11HIGH models, but showed no response in RB1+\/SLFN11- tumors.<br \/>In conclusion, B7H3-PBD treatment has potential to produce complete and durable response in appropriately-selected, heavily-pretreated metastatic CRPC and NEPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e13718fd-2735-4a7a-86d5-6625784bdb96\/@x03B8ZDU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Prostate cancer,CD276,INTERFERON SIGNALING,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12199"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Supreet Agarwal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Juan Yin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elaine Hurt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathleen Kelly<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the majority of antibodies in clinical development or approved for cancer therapy address protein targets that are only overexpressed on cancer cells and yet often show significant expression in healthy organs. Glycans tend to elicit superior tumor specificity as compared to proteins, since glycosylation is strongly altered in cancer, reflecting the drastic changes in tumor metabolism. The changes in glycosylation are mostly due to mutated or mislocated glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, giving rise to highly fucosylated, highly sialylated and truncated glycans. Therefore, proteins expressed in cancer cells can carry tumor-associated carbohydrates like the Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) and the Thomsen novelle (Tn) antigen as well as their respective sialylated forms sTF and sTn. To increase the tumor-specificity of protein-targeting antibodies, we have developed antibodies against several different protein\/carbohydrate combined epitopes (GlycoTargets). Targeting these specific antigens offers reduced on-target\/off tumor toxicity, which is key for highly potent therapies.<br \/>Methods: The specificity and glycosylation dependency of our antibodies were shown using differentially glycosylated proteins or carbohydrate PAA-conjugates in an ELISA format. Binding to several tumor cell lines and healthy human leukocytes was analyzed via flow cytometry. Binding to different cancer indications as well as related healthy tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.<br \/>Results: We have generated antibodies that bind to their target protein only if a specific tumor-associated carbohydrate is present and do not cross-react with the non-glycosylated protein itself, or the carbohydrate structure on different carrier-proteins. Due to the carbohydrate-dependent binding, our antibodies show markedly decreased on-target\/off-tumor binding. We will show that our antibodies mediate no binding of different healthy immune cell subsets in comparison to simple protein binding antibodies in flow cytometric analyses. Further, IHC studies reveal that our antibodies stain tumor tissue of different cancer indications but do not stain related normal tissues.<br \/>Conclusions: We successfully used the fact that glycosylation is strongly altered in cancer for the generation of highly tumor-specific antibodies that target neither glycan nor protein alone, but the potent combination thereof - a tumor-specific protein\/carbohydrate epitope. We could show that by using this approach we were able to reduce on-target\/off-tumor binding towards different healthy tissues and healthy immune cell subsets making these antibodies ideal candidates for a therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fce0ddcb-4665-4f68-bdab-277b537c64d7\/@x03B8ZDU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Glycosylation,Tumor antigen,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12212"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Patrik Kehler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anika Jaekel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antje Danielczyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Goletz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timo Lischke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evelyn Hartung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Weiß<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manon Weis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Gurka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Marinoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naomi Kast<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manon Weiske<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianne Morche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johanna Gellert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Theresa Neumann<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Nevertheless, many multipass membrane proteins are largely inaccessible as antibody targets due to their poor expression, membrane-dependent structure, small extracellular regions, and high sequence conservation between humans and rodents. Integral Molecular&#8217;s MPS Antibody Discovery platform specifically addresses each of these challenges. A key enabling feature of MPS is the use of chickens as an evolutionarily divergent host species for immunization, allowing a more robust immune response for targets that are highly conserved in mammals. We will present on antibodies isolated against challenging membrane protein targets in oncology including Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2).CLDN18.2 is a transmembrane adhesion protein undetectable in most adult healthy tissues but highly expressed in gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, and lung cancers. Antibody discovery efforts against this validated target are challenging due to the abundant expression of the splice isoform CLDN18.1 differing by only 8 amino acids in the extracellular domain. As part of the MPS platform, we used virus-like particles (Lipoparticles) to immunize chickens with a high concentration of native CLDN18.2 protein and obtain high-titer immune responses. This enabled us to generate and isolate a large and diverse collection of MAbs (48 unique clones) and select candidates for optimization. We present a panel of three highly specific, humanized CLDN18.2 MAbs with picomolar affinities that are superior to the clinical-stage benchmark. We will show in-depth profiling data for the MAb panel that were used for lead selection and de-risking clinical development. These data include biosensor binding kinetics, amino-acid resolution epitope mapping, and specificity testing against the Membrane Proteome Array (MPA) consisting of 6,000 membrane proteins. This panel of preclinical antibodies are being developed for therapeutic use in various formats, including bispecifics, antibody-drug conjugates, and CAR-T applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b3374dfc-6045-4450-bd7b-26500e2fefeb\/@x03B8ZDU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Monoclonal antibodies,Gastric cancer,Targeted therapy,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12205"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Brad Screnci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trevor Barnes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Shema<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Rimkunas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shruthi Kannan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Phillips<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Navia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Azuelos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Charpentier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Houtmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Miller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Lewis J.

Despite their potential as cancer therapeutics, very few CLDN6 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are in development, because MAbs with high affinity and specificity for CLDN6 are difficult to isolate. CLDN6 is structurally complex, with 4 transmembrane domains and 95% extracellular sequence conservation between human and mouse. Achieving MAb specificity for CLDN6 is especially challenging because its extracellular region strongly resembles those of 23 other human CLDN family members. In particular, the widely expressed CLDN9 differs from CLDN6 by only 3 extracellular residues. Using MAb discovery strategies specifically tailored to complex membrane proteins, including the use of virus-like particles (Lipoparticles), divergent species (chicken) immunization, and optimized phage display panning, we isolated 6 rare MAbs that recognize the native structure of CLDN6 with as low as picomolar affinity. The MAbs were screened against a Membrane Proteome Array containing ~6,000 membrane proteins and demonstrated specificity for CLDN6 with minimal cross-reactivity for CLDN9 or other CLDN family members. Epitope mapping using Shotgun Mutagenesis alanine scanning across the 220 residue CLDN6 sequence distinguished the binding sites of the MAbs from clinical-stage benchmarks. Atomic-level epitope mapping using comprehensive site-specific mutagenesis identified the &#947; carbon on CLDN6 residue Q156 as the critical structural mechanism enabling these MAbs to differentiate between CLDN6 and CLDN9 with high specificity. The CLDN6 MAbs identified here can be used to study CLDN6-positive cancers, including ovarian, endometrial, lung, and testicular cancer, and have the potential to be developed into highly selective therapeutics.<br\/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{89BE6D37-B7DA-43BA-9071-CF16B242B5CA}\"><caption>Characterization of highly specific CLDN6 MAbs isolated for treatment of solid tumors<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>MAb <\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\">IM301<\/span><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\">IM302<\/span><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Benchmark<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/b><\/p>  <b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-ansi-language: EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\">(IMAB027, Astellas)<\/span><\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">VH CDR3 length (Kabat)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>CLDN protein binding: Biosensor K<sub>D<\/sub> ± error, nM<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CLDN6 (target)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.6 ± 0.03<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt; 0.001<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.5 ± 0.01<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CLDN9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No binding<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No binding<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3.6 ± .09<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CLDN3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No binding<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No binding<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No binding<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CLDN4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No binding<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">146 ± 20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">153 ± 6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mouse CLDN6 binding<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cyno CLDN6 binding<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Conformational epitope<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Epitope topology<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Critical CLDN6 epitope residues<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">E48, E154, R158<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">E154, R158<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">F35, G37, S39<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95b2e037-9cc0-4f19-b01f-980d119baab4\/@x03B8ZDU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Therapeutics,Ovarian cancer,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12202"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Brad Screnci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lewis J.

Chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for metastatic disease and results in only modest improvements in median overall survival, typically with significant toxicity. We previously reported a novel treatment approach with the combination of the imipridone ONC212 and the MEK inhibitor trametinib. This combination demonstrated synergy in multiple <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutated and <i>KRAS<\/i> wild-type pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC3, PANC1, HPAF-II, AsPC-1). Using Western Blot, we assessed markers of autophagy, including Beclin-1 and LC3B, as well as key second messenger pathway activation\/suppression with p-AKT\/AKT and p-ERK\/ERK. The mechanism of this synergy appears to be heterogeneous, working through autophagy inhibition, MAPK\/PI3K pathway perturbation, activation of the integrated stress response and increased cell surface expression of death receptor 5. Further investigation has revealed that ONC212 also appears to synergize with various autophagy inhibitors including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. We hypothesized that combining trametinib and ONC212 may also induce cell death in-part through immune cell-mediated mechanisms. To explore this, we performed immune cell co-culture experiments using HPAF-II PDAC cells and natural killer (NK-92) cells at a 1:1 effector-to-target cell ratio<b> <\/b>with or without ONC212, trametinib, or the combination of the two at different concentrations. We assessed the levels of NK cell mediated-tumor cell death 4, 8, and 24-hours after simultaneous treatment and initiation of co-culture using fluorescent microscopy. Compared to trametinib, ONC212 only treated co-culture showed greater NK cell-mediated tumor cell death. At 24-hours, we also observed an increase in NK cell-mediated killing of PDAC cells with dual treatment as compared to single agent alone or vehicle controls. Importantly, this combination did not appear to have any effect on NK or tumor cell viability. Thus, this combination may represent a potential therapeutic modality for PDAC and may hold promise if combined with immunotherapy. Further <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments will be conducted to evaluate the effect of ONC212, trametinib, and other autophagy inhibitors on the PDAC tumor microenvironment using a T cell co-culture system. Similarly, <i>in vivo<\/i> murine studies will also be performed to assess the translational potential of this combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4c19e900-7ea6-4e4d-9ecf-b80a6ebebcc6\/@x03B8ZDU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Natural killer cells,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12213"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Alexander G.

Single-agent immune modulators targeting immune checkpoint blockade and multi-modal therapies including target immunotherapy have been proven to be clinically ineffective. Intensive research to explore novel targeted therapeutic strategies is undoubtedly required. Recently, nucleic acid nanotechnology has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment as it is highly programmable. Our previous results demonstrated that a replicable single-strand RNA origami (RNA-OG) technology stimulates a potent innate response primarily through a Toll-like receptor (TLR3) pathway to activate NK- and CD8-dependent antitumor immunity and counteract the peritoneal immunosuppressive environment in a murine peritoneal color cancer model. In this study, inspired by the robust innate immune suppressor cell types including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tumor-associated macrophages M2 (TAM2) in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer, we designed a combined single-strand RNA (ssRNA) origami integrated with 5FU immunochemotherapeutic strategy to efficiently target pancreatic cancer cells and TAM in tumor microenvironments. The ssRNA is designed to fold from a long ssRNA molecule in a programmable manner. In pancreatic cancer cell lines, the ssRNA combined with 5FU significantly inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth by growth curve and colony formation assay. We found that the combined ssRNA with 5FU dramatically induced pancreatic cancer cell death using pancreatic cell line and Raw264.7 in 2D cultures compared with 5FU. In 2D culture pancreatic cancer and Raw264.7 cell lines, 90% of the RNA origami was internalized in Raw264.7 cells within an hour. We also found that ssRNA origami triggered Raw264.7 cell death. In the xenograft model, ssRNA origami used with 5FU demonstrated high antitumor efficacy against pancreatic cancer. The Arg1 expression, which is the marker of TAM M2 and MDSC, was analyzed in xenograft tumor tissues using immunohistochemistry. We found that ssRNA implemented alongside 5FU significantly decreases the amount of Arg 1 positive TAM2 and MDSC cells in xenograft tumor tissue. We hypothesize that the ssRNA origami induced cell death of TAM M2 and MDSC cells in tumor microenvironments used alongside 5FU to target pancreatic cancer cells synergistically increases antitumor efficacy based on immunochemotherapy. Our integrated strategy is a promising approach to synergistically kill and remove the innate immune-suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment, improving the therapeutic efficacy against pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ab9d9724-430b-4c27-8e42-da1b9fa86fc8\/@x03B8ZDU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutic target,Pancreatic cancer,Nanoparticle,Tumor associated macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12210"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yang Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangbao Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chen Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaodong Qi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Yan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Inhibition of CD39 enzymatic activity can promote anti-tumor immune responses by increasing the immunostimulatory substrate ATP and decreasing the formation of the product AMP, a precursor to immunoinhibitory adenosine. CD39 inhibition has been shown to have an anti-tumor effect by activating dendritic cells, macrophages, and NK cells in the TME to promote antigen presentation and inflammatory cytokine release.<br \/>AB598 is a novel antibody, highly specific for human and cynomolgus CD39. AB598 potently binds to CD39 expressed on human primary myeloid cells and tumor cells and potently inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound CD39 enzymatic activity.<br \/>CD39 inhibition results in increased extracellular ATP (eATP) in the TME and subsequent activation of P2X and P2Y receptors. Myeloid cells highly express both CD39 and P2X7, the P2X receptor with the weakest ligand affinity for ATP (greater than 100 &#956;M), and most likely to be specifically activated by very high levels of eATP resulting from CD39 inhibition. Thus, the myeloid compartment has emerged as a key target associated with the therapeutic effects of CD39 inhibition. AB598 retains the ability to bind and inhibit membrane bound CD39 in the presence of high ATP (400 &#956;M). AB598 promotes maturation of human dendritic cells in the presence of ATP, as determined by increased expression of CD83 and CD86 and decreased expression of CD14. In human macrophages treated with ATP, AB598 activates the inflammasome, resulting in the secretion of pro-inflammatory IL-18 and IL-1&#946;. The ATP-dependent effects of AB598 support a therapeutic rationale of combining it with immunogenic therapies that induce release of ATP, such as chemotherapy and radiation, which might represent a new paradigm in the treatment of advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/21abc855-f632-4768-9a74-c6a5861269af\/@x03B8ZDU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Immunogenic cell death,Immuno-oncology,Adenosine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12198"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christine E.

Recent research indicates that UBQLN4 contributes to genomic stability through interactions with ubiquitylated MRE11. In a dysregulated state, UBQLN4 can shift double-strand break repair toward the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway or canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) pathway. The latter pathway is associated with an overexpression of UBQLN4 and can be suggestive of a sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitors.<br \/>As with any protein with diagnostic or therapeutic implications, having trustworthy antibodies is required to generate actionable and repeatable data. To help standardize the validation of these antibodies, the International Working Group for Antibody Validation was created in correlation with a 2016 Nature publication by Uhlen et al. In this publication, a series of &#8220;validation pillars&#8221; were proposed to give guidance on validating antibodies for scientific use. In response to that publication, we have institutionally adapted that language and many of those principles to supplement our existing validation scheme of antibodies produced on site, including a novel monoclonal antibody against UBQLN4.<br \/>Four UBQLN4 peptides or full-length UBQLN4 were synthesized and purified internally and used for rabbit immunization, B-cell sorting, and screening for activity via ELISA. Variable regions were sequenced to avoid clonal redundancy, and a subset of these clones were selected to be characterized via a strip-style western blot. Clones were also assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using tissue microarrays with multiple tissue and cell types, and specificity was determined via reciprocal IPs and western blot.<br \/>Over 200 clones were sequenced and screened by ELISA. These results allowed us to narrow the set down to 153 clones that were screened by strip-style western blot. 74 of these were assessed by IHC, 9 clones were screened by reciprocal IPs, and finally, 6 clones by western blot. Specificity was assessed throughout the process by the utilizing independent antibodies, complementary assays, a UBQLN4 knockout cell line, and UBQLN4-overexpressing cells.<br \/>Over the course of narrowing this clone set from 200 clones to a single antibody, we were able to meet the pillar requirements outlined in our validation scheme, empowering us to identify a superior antibody useable in several assays, including WB, IP, IHC, and ICC. Going forward, to further detail the use of this target's role in DNA repair, multiplex immunofluorescent studies will be performed in conjunction with Co-IP to identify additional protein binding partners unique to the DNA repair process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fb00d8ed-3c88-4b5d-9024-b98efae90f46\/@x03B8ZDU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody engineering,DNA damage,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17443"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian D.

TROP2 has pleiotropic functions including formation of cell-cell junctions by mediating interactions with extracellular and intracellular proteins. In situations of TROP2 deficiency its role in normal tissues appears to be compensated by expression of EpCAM, a highly related family member. In cancer, the levels of TROP2 are increased in many epithelial tumor types. Overexpression of TROP2 confer oncogenic behavior in several <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. Both its extracellular and intracellular domains play a role in modulating interactions with ligands and\/or receptors and with intracellular signaling partners to result in an oncogenic phenotype. In many solid tumors TROP2 upregulation is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and decreased survival in large groups of difficult-to-treat cancers, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. TROP2-based ADCs have been developed and one has been approved for therapeutic use in triple negative breast cancer and advanced bladder cancer. The toxicity associated with the toxin payload limits their use including in combination with chemotherapy in the earlier lines of treatment, and by the development of resistance to the payload. We isolated several anti-TROP2 heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAb) by immunization of a proprietary transgenic HCAb mouse. In this abstract, we describe the properties and activity of several of these antibodies. These antibodies are characterized by potent <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity in established tumor models in NCG mice in the absence of ADCC, and by the inhibition of tumor cell viability <i>in vitro<\/i>, directly and in the absence of any effector cells. In NCG mice, which are characterized by a short antibody half-life, anti-TROP2 HCAbs displayed a T1\/2 of approximately 3.5 days. These antibodies displayed very potent anti-tumor activity in established tumor xenograft models, causing tumor regression at 2 mg\/kg and 80% TGI at 0.5 mg\/kg in NCG mice when administered once per week. They also caused tumor regression when dosed once every three weeks in NCG mice and in tumors of very large sizes. Therefore, these antibodies directly target one or more aspects of TROP2 tumor biology that have a profound and long-lasting effect on the cancer cells. Upon glycoengineering, the afucosylated version of the antibodies displayed a strongly enhanced ADCC activity. <i>In vitro<\/i> they are characterized by different internalization rates which define several non-overlapping epitopes on TROP2. They are characterized by picomolar binding affinity to recombinant human TROP2 as determined by SPR. These antibodies bind with greater affinity to human and cyno but bind poorly to mouse, rat and rabbit. These potent naked TROP2 antibodies represent new opportunities to address TROP2 expressing cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/62163001-900b-4111-aca8-f4d6a552dd5c\/@y03B8ZDV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Trop-2,Antitumor agents,Cancer therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20878"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Israel Matos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yahya Ashraf<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiba Zahreddine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liying Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Baumholtz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claire Bonfils<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aniel Moya-Torres<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Cui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaowei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Wargachuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiffany Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elijus Undzys<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shugang Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacynthe Linda Tolouse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominic Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gordon Ngan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis DaCruz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Young<\/i><\/presenter>.
