[{"Abstract":"Engineered toxin bodies (ETBs) are comprised of a proprietarily engineered form of Shiga-like Toxin A subunit (SLT-A) genetically fused to antibody-like binding domains. ETBs work through novel mechanisms of action and are capable of forced internalization, undergoing retrograde translocation to the cytosol, and inducing potent cell-kill via the enzymatic and permanent inactivation of ribosomes resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis and induction of apoptosis through ribotoxic stress mechanisms.<br \/>Additionally, Molecular Templates has developed the Antigen Seeding Technology (AST) platform to generate ETBs with the unique ability to deliver foreign protein antigen to targeted populations of tumor cells. This MOA allows for the intracellular processing of antigen and subsequent surface MHC-I presentation required for activation of a re-directed T lymphocyte response and the capacity to restore a functional immune clearance program against the tumor.<br \/>Three ETBs are in clinical development (MT-5111 targeting HER2, MT-0169 targeting CD38, and AST enabled MT-6402 targeting PD-L1). The novel mechanisms of action have potential benefit in different indications including in the relapsed setting, when disease has progressed after chemotherapies and other targeted therapies, and additionally may be able to combine with standard of care.<br \/>ETBs are being developed that target other cell surface receptors expressed on solid tumors including tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (Trop2). Trop2 is a clinically validated target of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) and other cancers such as metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC).<br \/>In vitro, tumor cells expressing Trop2 are effectively, specifically, and directly killed with picomolar activity by targeted ETBs. AST enabled Trop2 targeted ETBs are capable of delivering viral antigens for multiple HLA types and inducing cytokine secretion and T-cell mediated killing in a co-culture assay of Trop2 target cells with antigen matched HLA type and antigen specific T-cells. These pre-clinical in vitro data suggest AST enabled Trop2 targeted ETBs have the potential to deplete Trop2 positive malignancies through multiple unique mechanisms of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/69af9408-fef9-440f-a6b0-dbe46e72e895\/@s03B8ZFd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Trop-2,Immunotoxin,Cytotoxicity,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13273"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Garrett L.

Amplification of <i>CCNE1<\/i>, which encodes cyclin E, has been proposed as a mechanism of resistance to HER2-targeted therapies. The Wee1 kinase inhibitor adavosertib (AZD1775) has demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity in the setting of cyclin E overexpression. We investigated the efficacy of T-DXd in combination with adavosertib in HER2-expressing cancers with and without co-amplification of <i>CCNE1<\/i>.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Frequency of<b> <\/b><i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification was determined among patients with <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification in a clinical genomic database at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Sulforhodamine B assay, western blotting, and Annexin V staining were used to determine the effects of T-DXd and DXd in combination with adavosertib <i>in vitro<\/i>. Four HER2-expressing gastric\/GEJ patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with or without co-amplification of <i>CCNE1<\/i> were tested with T-DXd in combination with adavosertib <i>in vivo<\/i>. Tumor volume and body weights were measured twice weekly and treatment responses were assessed by the relative treatment-to-control ratio, waterfall plots, and event-free survival (event defined as the day which tumors doubled in size from baseline).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of 515 patients identified at MDACC with <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification, 60 (11.6%) had co-amplification of <i>CCNE1<\/i>. Of the 405 patients identified within the TCGA with <i>ERBB2 <\/i>amplification, 43 (10.6%) had co-amplification of <i>CCNE1<\/i>. Tumor types with the highest frequency of <i>ERBB2<\/i>\/<i>CCNE1<\/i> co-amplification were gastric\/GEJ (38.1% MDACC, 31.0% TCGA), endometrial (25.0% MDACC, 29.6% TCGA), and ovarian (15.4% MDACC, 15.4% TCGA). Adavosertib was synergistic in combination with DXd in four cell lines with <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification, <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification, or <i>ERBB2<\/i>\/<i>CCNE1<\/i> co-amplification. Both DXd and T-DXd upregulated cyclin E and &#947;H2AX protein expression at 24 and 96 hours, and the combination of DXd or T-DXd with adavosertib enhanced apoptosis. T-DXd induced durable tumor regression in two HER2 amplified and HER2 overexpressing gastroesophageal PDX cancer models with HER2 amplification\/3+ overexpression and concomitant cyclin E amplification\/expression. Adavosertib enhanced the antitumor activity of T-DXd in two HER2 low, cyclin E amplified gastroesophageal cancer PDX models (one with an ERBB2 G778A mutation).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b><i>ERBB2<\/i> and <i>CCNE1<\/i> are frequently co-amplified.

LCB84 was prepared using<i> <\/i>ConjuAll<sup>TM<\/sup>, a proprietary site-directed conjugation technology of LegoChem Biosciences, which incorporates a conjugation &#8216;handle&#8217; joined by enzymatic prenylation to a specifically engineered recognition sequence (CaaX) on antibody light chains. This conjugation handle facilitates simple versatile chemical conjugation to the linker-payload. A proprietary plasma-stable cleavable linker that is recognized and cleaved by a cancer-associated lysosomal enzyme, &#946;-glucuronidase, was used to enable efficient and traceless payload release in a cancer-specific manner. LCB84 has been evaluated for anti-tumor activity and showed superior anticancer efficacy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), gastric cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models compared to the ADC competitors Trodelvy and DS-1062. The LCB84 treatments were well tolerated, with no changes in body weight compared to control animals, for all dosing groups. LCB84 has robust cross-reactivity against primate Trop-2, which allows rigorous toxicity studies in monkeys. Remarkably, preliminary toxicity studies using cynomolgus monkeys showed that LCB84 is well tolerated, with calculated therapeutic index (TI, MTD \/ MED) of ~30 for single dosing and ~40 for repeat dosing. In conclusion, LCB84 is highly effective against Trop-2-positive CDX models in mice at doses that are well tolerated in mice and in primate models. Use of this proprietary plasma-stable cancer-selective linker technology and the Hu2G10 anti-Trop-2 monoclonal antibody that targets cancer-activated Trop-2 has led to a greatly improved next generation ADC for the treatment of various Trop-2-positive solid cancers including TNBC, PDAC, NSCLC and gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae28c566-4f13-41c4-bb2c-697e7ed4f646\/@s03B8ZFd\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Anticancer therapy,Trop-2,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13275"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hyejung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emanuela Guerra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunji Baek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeojin Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyogeun You<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byeongjun Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taeik Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberti Saverio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chul-Woong Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Changsik Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Approximately, 40% of IBC cases are classified as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), meaning they test negative for hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and the amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which leads to no effective targeted therapies availability. However, 17&#946;-estrogen (E2) has been found to enhance the migration and invasion phenotypes of TN-IBC cells and it has been associated with the presence of a membrane G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPR30) and a novel cytoplasmic estrogen receptor (ER&#945;36 isoform) that can undergo an estrogen non-genomic (rapid) cell&#8217;s response. Recent studies have also reported a crosstalk between these estrogen non-genomic receptors and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in the presence of E2, inducing phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1\/2) and promoting oncogenic phenotypes (migration &#38; invasion) in TN-IBC cells. However, the exact role of GPR30 and ER&#945;36 in the non-genomic signaling pathway remains elusive in TN-IBC. We hypothesis that GPR30 and ER&#945;36 are necessary to undergo de estrogen non-genomic signaling and promote oncogenic phenotypes in TN-IBC SUM149 cells after E2 treatment.<br \/>Methods: We have measured migratory activity and tumor emboli formation of SUM149 cells (by wound-healing and 3D-cell proliferation assay), and phosphorylation levels of ERK1\/2 and AKT kinases (by western-blot) after treatments in time-points with E2 alone and in combination with G15 (GPR30 antagonist drug). We are also working to identify protein partners of GPR30 (by Ip and Mass-spec) after E2 treatment, including physical interaction with ER&#945;36, in TN-IBC and other types of breast cancers.<br \/>Results: G15 treatment in Sum149 cells significantly reduced E2-induced ERK1\/2 phosphorylation, indicating that GPR30 is necessary for the estrogen non-genomic signaling pathway and has direct involvement with the EGFR signaling cascade. Data acquired from these experiments will contribute to a better understanding of TN-IBC&#8217;s molecular structure and create new opportunities to develop novel targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aaf8b7ae-92f1-4b29-8087-f34520995dd3\/@s03B8ZFd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),Extracellular-regulated kinase 1\/2,Estrogen,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13276"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xavier S.

In 2021, it is estimated that 248,530 men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 34,130 will die from the disease. Although current treatments have success initially, development of resistance commonly leads to recurrence of an incurable castrate-resistant form of the disease. Thus, significant need for novel therapies to improve the outcome of castrate-resistant prostate cancer remains. B7-H3 (CD276), a member of the B7 family of immunomodulatory molecules, is overexpressed in primary and metastatic prostate cancer, and correlates with disease severity and poor clinical outcome. MGC018, a duocarmycin-based B7-H3 antibody-drug conjugate, is currently being evaluated in clinical studies. Here, MGC018 was explored preclinically to assess the potential for targeting B7-H3 in prostate cancer.<br \/>Methods: Immunohistochemistry studies were performed to define the expression of B7-H3 in prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMA). <i>In<\/i><i> vivo<\/i> efficacy studies were conducted with human prostate cancer cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models to explore the antitumor activity of MGC018 as a single agent and in combination with Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors. Based on the results in the CDX studies, <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy studies were extended to a panel of metastatic prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, which exhibit heterogenous expression of B7-H3 and more closely mimic the biological characteristics of patient tumors.<br \/>Results: Staining of prostate tumor TMAs revealed high expression of B7-H3 in primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Of the prostate samples evaluated, 95% (38\/40) of the tumor samples were positive for B7-H3 (H-score &#8805; 20): 65% had H-scores greater than 200, while 20% and 10% had H-scores between 101-200 and 1-100, respectively. MGC018 demonstrated <i>in vitro <\/i>cytotoxicity toward B7-H3-positive human prostate cancer cell lines. The <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity translated to potent antitumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i> toward prostate cancer CDX models, and the antitumor activity of MGC018 was enhanced when combined with inhibitors of PARP or AR.

Amphiregulin is a single-pass transmembrane protein proteolytically processed by TACE\/ADAM17 to release the soluble EGFR ligand, leaving a residual transmembrane stalk that is subsequently internalized. Here, we report the development of an antibody drug conjugate, GMF-1A3-MMAE, targeting an AREG neo-epitope revealed following ADAM17-mediated cleavage. The antibody does not interact with uncleaved Amphiregulin, providing a novel means of targeting cells with high rates of Amphiregulin shedding. Using fluorescent dye conjugation, we demonstrated that the antibody is internalized by cancer cells in a manner dependent on the presence of cell surface cleaved Amphiregulin. Antibodies conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) were cytotoxic in vitro and induced rapid regression of established breast tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice. We also show that these antibodies recognize the Amphiregulin neo-epitope in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue, suggesting their utility as a companion diagnostic for patient selection. Among ER-positive (n = 88) and ER-negative (n = 50) tumors evaluated, the proportions of tumors exhibiting medium\/high intensity staining with 1A3 were essentially equivalent (69.3% v 70%, respectively). These data provide proof-of-principle that cell surface proteolytic cleavage products can represent good targets for antibody drug conjugate development and highlight the potential of using this antibody drug conjugate against tumors shedding high levels of Amphiregulin.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bcec05bd-7dc0-4fed-9f47-00b0d5d8d18a\/@t03B8ZFe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Breast cancer,Preclinical testing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13278"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"d72dfe24-8cc4-4bdd-a5f5-4674e14b7c36","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d72dfe24-8cc4-4bdd-a5f5-4674e14b7c36\/@t03B8ZFe\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kristopher A.

The 18.2 isoform of claudin 18 (CLDN18.2) is expressed in healthy gastric mucosa cells and largely absent from other normal adult cell types. In contrast to the low expression in healthy tissues, CLDN18.2 is highly overexpressed in many cancer types including gastric and pancreatic malignancies at high frequencies (50-80%). The high tumor-normal expression differential of CLDN18.2 make it an attractive target for both therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody drug conjugate (ADCs). Here, we describe the preclinical development of a novel therapeutic CLDN18.2 mAb and ADC.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> CLDN18.2 specific mAbs were generated through a multiplexed immunization strategy by which mice were immunized with either peptides spanning loop 2 of the CLDN18.2 extracellular domain or mouse NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the full length CLDN18.2 protein. Antibody clones were screened by flow cytometry for selective binding to cell surface CLDN18.2. A CLDN18.2-directed ADC was generated from the fully humanized clinical candidate CLDN18.2 mAb by MMAE conjugation with a cleavable linker. CLDN18.2 positivity in cell line (CDX) and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models was determined by IHC assay.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Selective binding of the CLDN18.2-mAb to CLDN18.2, without cross reactivity to the more widely expressed CLDN18.1 isoform, was confirmed in human cancer cell lines and cells engineered to overexpress each isoform. The CLDN18.2-mAb demonstrated strong induction of both antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) in <i>in vitro<\/i> assays; suggesting that Fc effector function is a key component of the mechanism of action of the mAb. Treatment of CLDN18.2 positive gastric and pancreatic CDXs with CLDN18.2-mAb monotherapy induced significant inhibition of tumor growth in CD-1 nude mice. Binding of CLDN18.2-mAb or CLDN18.2-ADC to the cell surface CLDN18.2 induced internalization of the protein-antibody complex. Complete regression of CDX tumors was observed in response to treatment with the CLDN18.2-ADC in three separate CLDN18.2 positive models (two pancreas, one gastric). Moreover, complete loss of xenograft tumor burden was also observed in 4\/5 CLDN18.2 positive pancreas PDX models. No impact on xenograft tumor growth as observed in response to treatment with either the CLDN18.2-mAb or CLDN18.2-ADC in CLDN18.2 negative CDX\/PDX models.<br \/><b>Discussion:<\/b> These data support the clinical development of this CLDN18.2-mAb and CLDN18.2-ADC for the treatment of CLDN18.2 positive cancers. Each of these molecules will begin phase 1 clinical testing in early 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63957a63-cf0b-4373-b203-ebdac6602d87\/@t03B8ZFe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Pancreatic cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Monoclonal antibodies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13279"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Neil A.

BCY6033 contains a bicyclic peptide targeting EphA2, linked to the cytotoxin Monomethyl auristatin E via a molecular spacer and cleavable linker designed to target EphA2 expressing tumors. BCY6033 is analogous to BT5528, a BTC&#8482; currently in phase I\/II clinical trial in patients with advanced malignancies associated with EphA2 expression. Recent literature indicate that tumor EphA2 expression may be up regulated in EGFR mutant lung models following 1<sup>st<\/sup>, 2<sup>nd <\/sup>and possibly 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation EGFR inhibitors. Here we report on EphA2 expression in well characterized and clinically annotated patient derived xenografts (PDX) of NSCLC including <i>EGFR <\/i>mutant NSCLC derived either from erlotinib or osimertinib resistant patients. <i>In vivo<\/i> activity of BCY6033 is presented in two EphA2 expressing PDX models.<br \/>Experimental procedures: <i>In vivo<\/i>, an initial tolerability study was conducted with once weekly administration of BCY6033 by intravenous injection in NSG mice. The activity of BCY6033 was evaluated in EphA2 expressing EGFR mutant PDX models, DFCI-161 and DFCI-220 in NSG mice. A TMA was constructed containing FFPE derived from 69 PDX models (NSCLC n=61, SCLC-transformed n=5, de novo SCLC n=3). Of the 69 models, 35 were EGFR mutant. The TMA was subsequently stained via immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an &#945;-EphA2 (R&#38;D Systems) primary antibody. Tumor membranous H-score was assigned by a pathologist and a score of &#8805;50 was considered positive.<br \/>Results: Of the 69 PDXs, 16 were determined to be EphA2 positive. No correlation with genotype or clinical history was observed with EphA2 expression. EphA2 IHC was repeated on at least 5 different tumors for 5 PDX models with fast and robust <i>in vivo<\/i> growth latency. Two models, DFCI-161 and DFCI-220 with the most reproducible EphA2 staining were selected. Treatment with BCY6033 showed that a dose of 3 mg\/kg once weekly administered intravenously was well tolerated in female NSG mice. BCY6033 treatment led to significant tumor growth inhibition with &#62;80% tumor regressions in both DFCI-161 and DFCI-220 PDX models. Re-challenge of tumor out-growth showed that they retain sensitivity to BCY6033 treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: BCY6033 is a potentially promising drug effective against EphA2 expressing PDX models. Future studies and clinical trials will seek to determine the efficacy of BT5528 in EphA2 expressing tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4d844e51-5c41-49cf-8e90-71504e096088\/@t03B8ZFe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,NSCLC,Peptides,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13280"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kenneth Ngo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena V.

Two EGFR targeting ADCs include first generation Depatux-M, with an antimitotic toxin monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), and ABBV-321, with a DNA crosslinking agent pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (PBD) toxin. Due to the large molecular weight, poor drug distribution across the blood-brain barrier significantly limits the efficacy in EGFR-amplified GBM. We studied whether convection enhanced delivery (CED) can be used to safely infuse these two EGFR-targeted ADCs in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of EGFR-amplified GBM.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The efficacy of Depatux-M and ABBV-321 was evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> in two EGFRviii-amplified PDXs (GBM6 and GBM108). Immunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate drug distribution along with pharmacodynamics of the ADCs. CED was performed by stereotactic placement of an infusion catheter in the same location as the original tumor implantation. Immunohistochemistry was used to explore mechanisms of normal cell toxicity.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Despite potent activity <i>in vitro<\/i> (high ng\/ml IC50), systemic administration of either ADC conferred minimal extension in survival for either GBM6 or GBM108. In contrast, CED significantly enhanced ADC delivery to tumor and peri-tumoral regions and extended survival. In a pilot study in GBM6 with n=3 mice per group, a single CED infusion of 0.002mg ABBV-321 resulted in extended survival beyond 365 days for two mice, while other doses and placebo were associated with shorter median survival (0 mg - 39 days; 0.03 mg - 105 days; 0.3 mg - 49 days). In a subsequent trial evaluating serial infusions performed every 21 days, four infusions at 0.002 mg ABBV-321 resulted in lethal toxicity. In contrast, limiting ABBV-321 to only two serial CED infusions in GBM108 was associated with extended survival of more than 300 days vs. 53 days for AB095 antibody control infusion. In contrast, serial infusion with Depatux-M was much better tolerated. In a single infusion in GBM6, a 0.06 mg dose was well tolerated and associated with a 49-day extension in median survival. Further, four serial infusions at 0.06 mg given every 21 days in GBM6 and GBM108 was associated with 100 day and more than 250-day extension in survival as compared to AB095 antibody control infusion. To investigate the mechanism of toxicity, infusion of non-tumor bearing C57Bl6 mice with ABBV-321 resulted in a marked loss in NeuN staining and elevated CD68 and GFAP staining 7 days later; Depatux-M infusion was only associated with modest elevation in GFAP without loss of NeuN staining or elevated CD68-positive cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Depatux-M is well tolerated when infused into normal brain and results in extended survival in orthotopic GBM PDXs. In contrast, ABBV-321, with a distinct PBD toxin, had a much narrower therapeutic window when delivered by CED.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec652368-e511-414c-96b1-6784a5d5209b\/@t03B8ZFe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Glioblastoma,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13281"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kendra A.

SLTA has been engineered to reduce innate immunogenicity and therefore increase the safety of ETBs whilst retaining potent cytotoxic properties. When targeted via a binding domain, SLTA is internalized and routes to the cytosol leading to irreversible ribosome inactivation and ultimately cell death.<br \/>ETBs have been developed to treat a wide variety of cancers, including breast, lymphoma, multiple myeloma and PD-L1 positive solid tumors. This technology holds promise for non-oncology indications as well, particularly as a targeted and non-genotoxic conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) ablation to prepare patients for autologous stem cell transplant.<br \/>c-KIT (CD117) is a well-known marker of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and is overexpressed in a high percentage of certain cancers including GIST, SCLC and AML. While tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib are effective therapies for c-KIT mutant GIST, resistance often occurs by the development of secondary mutations in the intracellular signaling domains. Thus, c-KIT represents a potential ETB target for both oncological and HSC transplant conditioning indications. Here we present data highlighting the in vitro potency and efficacy of CD117-targeting ETBs on cancer cell lines as well as on primary human CD34+ HSCs. CD117-targeted ETBs demonstrate exquisite specificity in vitro by killing only target positive CD34+ cells at picomolar potency while sparing the progenitors that lack CD117 expression. However, relatively low CD117 receptor levels on CD34+ HSCs prevent complete killing in vitro, limiting the observed efficacy. To overcome this challenge, an additional cytotoxic payload was conjugated to the ETB molecule to capitalize on ETBs&#8217; unique internalization and routing properties to deliver a secondary mechanism of action. ETB-drug conjugates (ETB-DCs) exhibited improved cytotoxicity in vitro, especially in CD117-low target cells. Moving forward, we plan to explore both the ETB and the ETB-DC therapeutic index in vivo with a series of CD117+ tumor efficacy and HSC depletion models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8cc712ff-2244-480b-b7bb-9f375f41c3c3\/@t03B8ZFe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"c-Kit,Stem cells,Gastrointestinal stromal tumor,Immunotoxin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13282"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Caleigh Howard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shu Wiley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenzhao Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Mendiola<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Partridge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara LeMar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Amador<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amit K.

We developed a fusion protein (GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub>) composed of granzyme B, VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> (a naturally-occurring isoform of the VEGF-A family that binds to VEGF receptors R-1 and R-2), and a human IgG heavy chain fragment (for dimerization and to augment in vivo circulation and anti-tumor efficacy). GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> was transiently expressed in HEK-293E cells under serum-free conditions purified with a final yield of approximately 40 mg\/L. Comparison of GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> with its expected molecular weight suggests significant glycosylation when produced in HEK-293E cells. The enzymatic activity of granzyme B in GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> was comparable to that of commercially available human granzyme B. GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> readily internalized into VEGFR-2+ cells within 2 hours of treatment while untargeted granzyme B was not internalized, demonstrating that internalization was receptor-mediated. Cytotoxicity studies against a panel of tumor and endothelial cells indicated cytotoxicity in the nanomolar range against cell lines expressing high levels of VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 while control (receptor-negative) cells demonstrated IC<sub>50<\/sub> levels in the high micromolar range. Treatment of VEGFR-2+ endothelial and tumor cells with GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> resulted in robust cell death via apoptosis and\/or necrosis. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> serum stability of GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> indicated a gradual protein loss of GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub>, with an overall loss of about 50% over 96 hours. The maximum tolerated dose of GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> was not reached when BALB\/c mice were treated with a total 475 mg\/kg given every other day over 5 doses. Treatment of mice bearing OVCAR8 tumor xenografts with GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> (100 mg\/kg over 5 doses) resulted in significant growth inhibition of established tumors compared to vehicle controls. Treated tumors showed a significant decrease in the number of CD31+ blood vessels and Ki-67+ proliferating tumor cells compared to controls, when assessed at the end of the study. These studies clearly indicate that GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> has significant anti-tumor effects <i>in vivo<\/i> with virtually no toxicity against normal tissues at doses 4-5 times higher than therapeutic levels.

For this reason, there is a need for a new angiogenesis inhibitor that can specifically target the tumor vasculature. In our previous study, we revealed that doppel, a prion-like protein, was overexpressed specifically in the tumor vasculatures, but not in normal endothelium, and its expression enhanced blood vessel formation. To develop our new anti-angiogenic agent, we produced monoclonal antibodies which target doppel as the antigen.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We evaluated whether the doppel antibody inhibits angiogenesis by a spheroid assay. We cultured human colonic tumor-associated endothelial cells (HCTEC) and collected the cells by a hanging drop method. After producing compact aggregates, the spheroids were collected and embedded into collagen-based 3D cultures. The culture media\/growth factor\/doppel antibody mixture was added to each well that contained 3D spheroid cultures. After 24 hours, the number of sprouts was counted and analyzed. Further, HCTECs were incubated with culture media, growth factor, and doppel antibodies for investigating the underlying mechanisms. Each well was lysed, and we conducted western blot and microarray experiments using the lysates. In addition, we injected fluorescent dye-conjugated doppel antibody into tumor xenograft mouse models and visualized the tumor-targeting efficacy using in vivo imaging system (IVIS).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In spheroid assays, we found that doppel antibody SNU-H01 and SNU-H02 inhibit angiogenesis (by 32% and 29%, respectively) compared to control. In anti-phosphorylation assays using western blot, the amount of phosphorylated VEGFR2 and phosphorylated FGFR1 was decreased in doppel antibody SNU-H01 and SNU-H02-treated groups. Also, when SNU-H02-treated lysate was added to the microarray kit, STAT5A and beta-catenin were inhibited. Inhibition of STAT5A may promote apoptosis and increase sensitivity to anticancer drugs, and inhibition of beta-catenin may further increase suppression of angiogenesis. In addition, doppel antibody SNU-H04 accumulates in the tumor significantly higher compared to IgG injected mouse group.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Doppel antibodies in development, SNU-H01, -H02, -H03, -H04, will be screened and selected for their anti-angiogenic efficacy and favorable pharmacodynamic features. We hope that doppel antibody is expected to be a new and superior tumor vasculature-specific angiogenesis inhibitor that can overcome the limitations of existing anti-angiogenic agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b52d7756-a2e7-4fdb-adf9-f0e2b64734d9\/@t03B8ZFe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Targeted drug delivery,Angiogenesis inhibitor,Tumor neovasculature,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13288"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ha Kyeong Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruby Maharjan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeojin Jeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong Uk Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngro Byun<\/i><\/presenter>.

We discovered that Trop-2 cleavage by ADAM10 is an activator switch for induction of cancer growth and metastatic diffusion (2). This cleavage causes a spatial rearrangement of the extracellular portion of Trop-2 and exposes protein sites that would normally be inaccessible.We devised a strategy to obtain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) capable of recognizing these cancer-exposed sites.Most Trop-2-targeted approaches are based on anti-Trop-2 mAbs that recognize a single immunodominant epitope poised between the globular and stem regions. Such mAbs have limited therapeutic index.We removed the immunodominant epitope by deletion mutagenesis. To optimize breadth of immune response, mice were immunized with target proteins produced in cells with different end-glycosylation patterns, including tumor cells, insect, yeast, bacterial cells. Screening for cancer-specific mAbs were performed by cell-based ELISA assays, ELISA assays on recombinant target proteins, bio-layer interferometry, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy on cleaved, wild-type and glycosylation-site mutagenized Trop-2. mAbs were obtained that efficiently bound Trop-2 expressing cancer cells and were able to inhibit cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i>. We humanized the 2G10 mAb as the IgG1 Hu2G10 antibody with an affinity for recombinant, cancer-specific, cleaved Trop-2 that is several orders of magnitude higher than for the wtTrop-2. <i>In vivo<\/i> the naked Hu2G10 antibody was effective at inhibiting the growth of breast, colon, ovary and prostate cancers. In the ADC setting Hu2G10 drove high anticancer effectiveness with unprecedented specificity, for best-in-class anticancer therapy. (1) E.

Lack of early symptoms and a poor response to current therapies make PDAC the deadliest of all major cancers. PDAC is characterized by a dense fibroinflammatory stroma which is composed of fibroblasts and immune cells and has been implicated to influence tumor progression and therapeutic outcome. In this study, we aim to disrupt cellular signaling pathways by targeting ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17). ADAM17 is a membrane bound enzyme which cleaves cell surface proteins. Its function is closely linked with autocrine and paracrine signaling of immunomodulation as well as activation of EGFR, which is a central molecule for pancreatic tumorigenesis. To investigate whether EGFR is activated via a paracrine manner from macrophages, the most abundant immune-related stromal cells in pancreas cancers, we generated a pancreatic tumor mouse model with ADAM17 deletion in myeloid cells by using a dual recombinase strategy. We observed that lack of ADAM17 in the myeloid cells resulted in a delay of acinar cell transformation and an associated decrease in EGFR activation. To further examine the tumor supportive role of ADAM17, systemic inhibition of ADAM17 using anti-ADAM17 antibody, MEDI3622, was tested in orthotopic tumor bearing mice. Tumor regression was observed in the mice treated with MEDI3622 and was accompanied by high infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and low infiltration of G-MDSC (granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells). In addition, activation of EGFR and STAT3, which are associated with two pro-tumoral signaling pathways, were reduced by MEDI3622. These results demonstrate a pronounced anti-tumor effect by ADAM17 blockage and indicate ADAM17 as a therapeutic target of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/50ede742-b1e6-4db9-b1e8-0482baf138a8\/@u03B8ZFf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,ADAM17,EGFR,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13291"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hui-Ju Wen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Howard Crawford<\/i><\/presenter>.

Conversely it has little or no expression in normal tissues. This expression profile makes CLDN6 an ideal target for development of potential therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). This study describes the generation and preclinical characterization of an anti-CLDN6 ADC consisting of a humanized anti-CLDN6 monoclonal antibody coupled to MMAE via a cleavable linker.<br \/>Materials and Methods: A fully humanized anti-CLDN6 antibody was initially characterized for binding affinity, selectivity\/specificity, internalization characteristics and in vivo efficacy. It was then conjugated to MMAE resulting in the potential therapeutic anti-CLDN6 ADC. The anti-tumor efficacy of the ADC was next assessed for anti-tumor efficacy in CLDN6 positive (CLDN6+) and negative (CLDN6-) xenografts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of specific cancers including ovarian and endometrial cancer.<br \/>Results: Selective binding of the ADC to CLDN6, without cross reactivity to other CLDN family members CLDN3, CLDN4 and CLDN9, was confirmed in human cancer cell lines and cells engineered to overexpress each protein. The ADC was also shown to rapidly internalize in CLDN6+ cells. Robust tumor regressions following treatment with the ADC were observed in CLDN6+ xenografts that were sustained beyond the treatment window. Conversely, there was limited to no activity of the ADC in CLDN6- xenografts models. In addition, the prevalence of CLDN6 expression in human ovarian and endometrial cancers was assessed by IHC in tissue microarrays and found to be 28% (ovarian epithelial carcinomas) and 11% (endometrial carcinomas), respectively.<br \/>Discussion: Overall, these data suggest that our anti-CLDN6 ADC may be a promising treatment for patients with CLDN6+ tumors and it is currently in Phase I clinical testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f19ff35-cda8-4175-86a2-b8d987e92cc0\/@u03B8ZFf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Targeted therapy,CLDN,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13292"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Martina S.

The correlation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) activity and breast cancer is evident from the amplification of S6K1 localized chromosomal region 17q23 in 20% of primary breast cancers. S6K1 is a conserved serine\/threonine protein kinase, is the principal kinase effector downstream of the PI3K\/mTOR regulatory signaling pathway. Over-expression of S6K1 has been associated with cell transformation and elevated proliferation rates in tumors, poor prognosis and an increased risk of local recurrence. S6K1 has been found to play an important role in the progression of ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer, HER2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer and node-negative premenopausal breast cancer. Inhibition of this kinase can prove to be beneficial for the treatment of several types of breast cancer. Our group has identified new molecules that are derivatives of 6-amido-4-aminoisoindoline-1,3-dione core structure as S6K1 inhibitors with low micromolar inhibition potency (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 2-5 &#956;M). These compounds also inhibited the growth of HER2+ (SKBR3 and HER2&#916;16), ER+ and triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) with a range of EC<sub>50<\/sub> values (2 - 2000 &#956;M). The EC<sub>50<\/sub> values of growth inhibition of these compounds varied by the type of breast cancer cells and were in direct correlation with the expression levels of S6K1 in those cell lines. <i>These results clearly indicate that high efficacy S6K1 inhibitors can function as potential therapeutics for multiple types of breast cancer. <\/i>Future work involves <i>in-vivo<\/i> studies to understand the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the three compounds.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ac366e9c-8df8-4c2a-8786-3f7a60795e3e\/@u03B8ZFf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Small molecule inhibitor,Kinase inhibitors,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18163"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Satyendra Kumar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajesh Komati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shahensha Shaik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melyssa Bratton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linh Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rion Sam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elijah Johnson-Henderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Breyanah Graham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher WIlliams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayalakshmi Sridhar<\/i><\/presenter>.

Due to its heterogeneity, clinical biomarkers and targeted therapies for this disease remain elusive, and chemotherapy has been the standard of care for early and metastatic TNBC. ErbB-2 is classically located at the membrane of BC cells, where it triggers signalling cascades and promotes oncogenesis. However, we have demonstrated that ErbB-2 is also localized in the nucleus (NErbB-2) of TNBC cells and primary tumors, from where it drives growth. We also discovered that TNBC expresses both wild-type ErbB-2 (WTErbB-2) and alternative ErbB-2 isoform c (ErbB-2c). ErbB-2 migrates to the nucleus via retrograde transport. The small molecule Retro-2 is a non-toxic inhibitor of the retrograde transport route that protects cells from the deleterious effects of toxins and viruses. Here, we revealed that Retro-2 evicts both WTErbB-2 and ErbB-2c from the nuclei. Using BC models from several molecular subtypes, we demonstrated that Retro-2 specifically halts the proliferation of cells expressing NErbB-2 in a dose-dependent manner, whilst did not inhibit cell proliferation in the ErbB-2-negative MCF10A normal breast cell line. Additionally, Retro-2 decreased the expression of genes induced by NErbB-2 (cyclin D1 and Erk5) and promoted cell cycle arrest at G0\/G1 phase and apoptosis. Even more, in preclinical models (including xenografts and tumor explants), Retro-2 treatment resulted in the eviction of NErbB-2 and abrogation of tumor growth. Our mechanistic studies demonstrated that Retro-2 induces a differential accumulation of WTErbB-2 at the early endosomes and plasma membrane, and of ErbB-2c at the Golgi, further preventing its sorting to the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings shed light both on Retro-2 action on endogenous protein cargoes undergoing retrograde transport and on the biology of ErbB-2 splicing variants. Together, our present discoveries provide evidence for the rational repurposing of Retro-2 as a novel therapeutic agent for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a536cf3-7101-4125-9b0e-fb44a716be4d\/@u03B8ZFf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Nuclear ErbB2,Nuclear translocation,Retrograde Transport,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18164"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Santiago Madera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Franco Izzo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria F.

Activated nuclear &#946;-catenin forms a complex with TCF\/LEF (T-cell factor\/lymphoid enhancer binding factor) and drives the transcription of genes essential for cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Blocking the &#946;-catenin-TCF\/LEF interaction offers an attractive therapeutic strategy to treat a large population of patients with WNT pathway mutations. However, &#946;-catenin is considered as an &#8220;undruggable&#8221; target because it lacks tractable hydrophobic pockets for small-molecule binding. To address this challenge, we have successfully discovered and developed Helicon<sup>TM<\/sup> peptides targeting the &#946;-catenin-TCF\/LEF interaction. Using this novel modality, linear peptides are locked in a helical structure via a proprietary tethering technology to yield macrocyclic stapled peptides.<br \/>Our helicon&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;s exhibit picomolar &#946;-catenin binding affinity and nanomolar anti-proliferative cell-based activity. Cells treated with lead helicons followed by unbiased RNAseq GSEA indicate that the WNT\/&#946;-catenin pathways represent the top downregulated transcriptional signatures after treatment. Furthermore, PRISM cell line screening of more than 900 cell lines reveals that the most sensitive lines are enriched with APC and CTNNB1 mutations. Mechanistically, helicon treatment reduces nuclear &#946;-catenin and alters the levels of cyclin D2\/D3 and p27 in the sensitive lines. In vivo, our helicons display favorable pharmacokinetic properties, broad tissue distribution, and potent anti-tumor effects. Taken together, our data demonstrate &#946;-catenin-targeting Helicon<sup>TM<\/sup> peptides have the potential to become the next-generation class of therapeutics to treat cancers with defined genetic mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/60198943-af92-4c65-a450-857da88489a1\/@u03B8ZFf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt pathway,Drug discovery,&#946;-catenin,Peptides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18165"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yaguang Si<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian White<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Cappucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Ramirez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Ponthier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erica Visness<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Ling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peicheng Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minjung Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ty Thomson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josue Alfaro-Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pieter Beerepoot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sorabh Agarwal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paula Ortet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miroslaw Lech<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhi Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Voké Olokpa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Jewett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel La<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lihua Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John McGee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Tremblay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Hurov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Greg Verdine<\/i><\/presenter>.

That selectivity is limited, and toxicity to normal cells remains a major limitation to the success of chemotherapy. To increase selectivity by exploiting cancer cell genetic instability, we demonstrated that the small molecule IBR2 (an inhibitor of the DNA repair protein RAD51) enhanced cytotoxicity of numerous anticancer drugs including agents that do not directly target DNA (J Pharmacol Expt Ther, 364: 46-54, 2018. doi.org\/10.1124\/jpet.117.241661). We demonstrated the ability of IBR2 and a derivative [IBR120, (R)-3-(2-(benzylsulfonyl)isoindolin-1-yl)-1h-indole] to synergistically inhibit proliferation of a wider range of cancer cell lines in combination with a broad range of anticancer drugs (Proc. Amer. Assoc. Cancer Res., 60: Abst. 3057, 2019). To improve the activity and potentially increase selectivity for inhibiting RAD51, modifications were made to the structure of IBR120 using a virtual drug-protein docking program, yielding the compound JKYN-1. JKYN-1 inhibits proliferation of cancer cell lines approximately 5 times more strongly than IBR120. Given the potential importance of combining JKYN-1 with targeted anticancer drugs to increase therapeutic index, and the synergy previously observed between IBR120 and agents targeted against specific tumor types, JKYN-1 was tested in combination with targeted agents against a panel of tumor cell lines. Four- to five-day drug exposures were conducted in 96-well plates. Relative cell density determined using vital stains (alamarBlue&#169;, neutral red) was reported as a percent of the fluorescence\/absorbance of control cultures. Cell lines were representative of tumors from breast (MCF-7), prostate (DU145, LNCaP), stomach (N87), pancreas (PANC-1, Capan-1, Capan-2) and lung (A549b, H1650). The chemotherapy agents included inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (osimertinib, afatinib), other tyrosine kinases (regorafenib, imatinib), sex steroid receptors (4-OH-tamoxifen, enzalutamide), and microtubule function (docetaxel). To improve solubility, a methylsulfonate salt of JKYN-1 was used for most experiments. JKYN-1-mesylate decreased the concentration of drugs that inhibited proliferation by 50% (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) by up to 90%, depending on the drug and cell line, indicating synergy between the agents. There were some combinations in which additivity but no synergy was observed, indicating selectivity for this interaction. Individual combinations will be presented. The ability of JKYN-1 to enhance antiproliferative activity of a wide variety of anticancer agents, and its potential selectivity for cancer cells, make possible the future use of RAD51 inhibitors as systemic therapy potentiators to improve clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/39a584a6-ba49-4a4e-89bb-94071dd2026d\/@u03B8ZFf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RAD51,Synergism,Antitumor agents,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18166"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peter J.

Therefore, we focus on targeting the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, key drivers of the primary steps of metastasis: cell migration and invasion. We developed MBQ-167 as a small molecule dual inhibitor for Rac1 and Cdc42 activation with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of 103 and 78 nM, respectively. In metastatic human breast cancer cells, MBQ-167 inhibits the Rac\/Cdc42 downstream effector p21-activated kinase (PAK)\/LIM kinase\/Cofilin signaling, lamellipodia extension, and thus, cell polarity, and migration. In addition, in metastatic breast cancer cells, MBQ-167 inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression to ultimately induce apoptosis via anoikis. MBQ-167 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in experimental and spontaneous HER-positive and Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse models. MBQ-167 has 35% bioavailability and is not toxic in rodent or canine models up to 1000 mg\/kg. Therefore, we are further developing MBQ-167 as a lead anti metastatic cancer compound. The objective in this study is to elucidate potential activity of MBQ-167 metabolites. Prior work has identified MBQ-167 metabolites via LC MS\/MS from a mammalian liver microsome (rats and human) assay. Four of the MBQ-167 metabolites with the highest MS peak area, were analyzed in metastatic breast cancer cell lines, for cell viability via MTT assays and apoptosis via caspase 3\/7 assays. We report that the metabolites M6, M7, M8, and M9 did not inhibit cell viability or induce apoptosis at 250 or 500 nM in HER2-type MDA-MB-435, and TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines, compared to MBQ-167. We next analyzed whether these metabolites could inhibit the activation of Rac and Cdc42 by analyzing the phosphorylation status of its downstream effector p-21 activated kinase isoforms 1\/2\/3 (PAK1\/2\/3). When MBQ-167 and metabolites at 250nM were incubated for 24h in HER2-type MDA-MB-435 metastatic cancer cells, and the lysates western blotted with antibodies to total PAK1\/2\/3 or phospho-Pak1\/2\/3, we found a decrease in the phosphorylation levels of PAK in response to MBQ-167 and metabolite M6. However, since the peak area of M6 in the microsome assay is only 6% compared to MBQ-167, we conclude that MBQ-167 is the major active compound with anti-metastatic cancer properties.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b2d2e1f7-31d1-4fbd-928a-a6ff18a39595\/@u03B8ZFf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Rac,GTPase,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18168"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia I.

Although kinase inhibitors have proven to be efficient with promising clinical results, the development of drug resistance is one of the major issues in targeted therapy. CD133, also known asProminin-1, is a membrane glycoprotein studied extensively as a cell surface marker for cancer stem cells. In our previous studies, mebendazole, a repurposed broad spectrum anti-helminthic agent, inhibited the growth of NRAS mutant melanoma cells in combination with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor. However, a CD133-positive cancer stem cell population remain resistant to this targeted therapy. Use of RNA aptamers in diagnostic as well as therapeutics has been studied recently in different types of cancer cells. Drug delivery of aCD133 aptamer coupled with doxorubicin has been found to inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells. In this study, we targeted the cancer stem cells expressing CD133 with RNA aptamers, in combination with trametinib and mebendazole to sensitize the cells to the combination treatment. Patient derived melanoma cell lines, BAKP and POT, harboring BRAF<sup>WT<\/sup>\/NRAS<sup>Q61K<\/sup> and BRAF<sup>WT<\/sup>\/NRAS<sup>Q61R<\/sup> driver mutations, were co-transduced with aTet-on vector expressing CD133 and a Tet activator. The doxycycline-induced and uninduced cells were subjected to single agent treatment with 100 nM trametinib, 100 nM mebendazole or 100 nM CD133 RNA aptamer, as well as dual and triple agent combinations for 24 or 48 hours. XTT cell viability and apoptotic assays such as AnnexinV-PI flow cytometry analysis revealed that the triple combination with trametinib, mebendazole and the CD133 aptamer was the most effective in inducing apoptotic cell death, even in the doxycycline-induced CD133-overexpressing melanoma cells. Further studies will use preclinical<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vivo<\/i> mouse xenograft models to investigate the effects on tumor growth of CD133 RNA aptamers in combination treatments, potentially making it available for clinical trials aiming to improve patient response to therapeutics against drug-resistant melanoma cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9fbb4631-1e6c-46b5-867e-4d7f324daea5\/@v03B8ZFg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aptamer,CD133,Targeted therapy,Ras oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18170"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yoga Haribabu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raymond Chien<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryyan Alobaidi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li-Wei Kuo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nusrat Islam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cynthia M.

Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) mediate chromatin compaction and are frequently overexpressed in GBM. Hence, over the last decade, there has been considerable interest in HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) for the treatment of malignant brain tumors. However, to date almost all HDACi tested clinically have failed to provide significant therapeutic benefit to primary and recurrent GBM patients. These HDACi are broad-spectrum with poor or unknown pharmacokinetic profiles and have narrow therapeutic window. Isoform specificity for HDACi is important given that not all HDAC enzymes are equally expressed in GBM. Recently, we uncovered the functional importance of HDAC1 in therapy-resistant glioma stem cells, where we found that its expression increases with brain tumor grade and is correlated with decreased survival. While no class I HDAC isoform-specific inhibitors are currently available, the second-generation HDACi, quisinostat harbors high specificity for HDAC1. In this study, we assessed the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and radiosensitizing properties of quisinostat in preclinical models of human GBM. <i>In vitro<\/i> analyses conducted in patient-derived glioma stem cell (GSC) lines revealed that quisinostat exhibited potent growth inhibition in multiple GSC lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub> ~ 50-86 nM), and induced global histone hyperacetylation, elevated DNA damage, cell death, cell cycle arrest and decreased expression of multiple key stem cell proteins. To determine the efficacy and drug distribution profile of quisinostat <i>in vivo<\/i>, athymic mice with orthotopic or flank tumors were treated with an optimized treatment schedule. At various timepoints during treatment, plasma and brain\/tumor tissue were collected to measure total and unbound drug levels by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) and assess pharmacodynamic changes within tumor tissues. We found that quisinostat reduces tumor burden in flank and orthotopic models of GBM and extends survival when administered in combination with radiation therapy <i>in vivo<\/i>. Together, these results provide a rationale for developing quisinostat as a potential combination therapy with radiation in the treatment of GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e1b952b-5f38-4535-adc6-bac0a632433a\/@v03B8ZFg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,HDAC inhibitor,Pharmacokinetics,Radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20585"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Costanza Lo Cascio<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tigran Margaryan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ernesto Luna Melendez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James McNamara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Knight<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Himes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Connor White<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexis Giff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesus Peralta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nader Sanai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Artak Tovmasyan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shwetal Mehta<\/i><\/presenter>.
