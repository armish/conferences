[{"Abstract":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast subtype of breast cancer that lacks targeted therapies. We have previously identified several novel stilbene compounds that effectively decreased viability of TNBC. Stilbenes are natural defense compounds produced by plants and have been popularized in recent years due to general observed health benefits. Resveratrol, the most widely studied stilbene, has been revealed to possess significant antioxidant and anti-cancer effects. Many stilbenes are classified as phytoestrogens, but unlike estrogens, stilbenes do not appear to negatively impact normal breast tissue or reproductive organ health. Thus, these compounds represent new alternatives for cancer therapeutic development. The focus of this research was to identify stilbene compounds with anti-migration and\/or anti-invasive properties in TNBC cells and to determine the mechanism of these inhibitory effects. Two TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-157 and BT-549, were treated with stilbene compounds at sub-lethal doses and assessed for effects on migration and invasion using transwell assays. Cell morphology changes were evaluated with results suggestive of reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key contributor in the metastatic process and a common characteristic of many TNBC cells. Gene expression analysis confirmed stilbene-induced changes of EMT-related genes. These data indicate that stilbenes, like resveratrol and related analogues, reduce cell motility and invasion through regulation of EMT gene expression in TNBC cells. Development of synthetic analogs of natural compounds remains a viable drug development opportunity for new therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9786fe19-4696-4461-9c8c-8fbb3015985b\/@v03B8ZM1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Invasion,Natural products,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11754"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lyndsay V.

It displays both inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity which is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This program involves the acquisition of a mesenchymal-like phenotype allowing cells to disseminate from the primary tumor and metastasize. However, recent studies show that tumor cells do not need to undergo complete EMT to gain invasive potential; instead, co-expression of both epithelial and mesenchymal markers is critical for metastasis. Such tumor cells are thought to display epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which bestows them with enhanced fitness and flexibility to fulfill diverse requirements of the metastatic cascade. Additionally, hybrid EM phenotype has been linked to immunesuppression but has been understudied due to lack to suitable models with intact immune system. Thus, this necessitates the mechanistic dissection of tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in models with EM plasticity. To characterize the contribution of EMP to metastasis, we utilized syngeneic mouse mammary tumor cell lines, which are hybrid EM and investigated their proteomic and cytokine profile and identified several novel cytokines.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) was performed to determine the proteomic profile of tumors with EM plasticity. In addition, Luminex assay was performed to assess the cytokine\/chemokine profile in above tumor models.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The RPPA involved a panel of 450 antibodies and showed that tumors with EM plasticity were enriched in specific immunesuppressive proteins. At the same time, Luminex analysis was suggestive of recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in models with EM plasticity. Additionally, cells with EM plasticity showed the ability to induce tumor-promoting\/M2-like macrophages (in vitro).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our data indicates that cells\/tumors with EM plasticity show differential protein expression than E and M counterparts and are enriched in specific immunesuppressive proteins. Moreover, such cells have immune networks (cytokines\/chemokines) that promote recruitment of TAMs - the largest myeloid infiltrate in the microenvironment of solid tumors. Thus, our study invites more attention to investigate the mechanisms of immunesuppression and metastasis in tumors with EM plasticity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0f1c091-b1f7-4101-a7f5-dd862616c70b\/@v03B8ZM1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Macrophages,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11767"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tanvi H.

BNIP3L\/NIX is a mitophagy cargo receptor that integrates into the outer mitochondrial membrane where it interacts with processed LC3 at growing phagophore membranes to promote mitophagy. Our preliminary data shows that elevated BNIP3L\/NIX expression in basal-like breast cancers correlates with worse overall patient survival. However, the functional significance of BNIP3L\/NIX for growth and progression of breast cancer has not been determined. We generated a CRISPR\/Cas9 KO BNIP3L\/NIX 4T1 mouse mammary tumor model to determine how loss of BNIP3L\/NIX affected tumor progression and metastasis. We observed that loss of BNIP3L\/NIX decreased tumor cell growth and importantly attenuated metastasis to the lungs. By performing RNA-seq analysis, we found that these striking findings were associated with a decrease in molecular signatures expression of hypoxia-inducible genes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, including Twist and Vimentin. In addition, expression of Vimentin was complete ablated in 4T1 KO BNIP3L\/NIX tumors <i>in vivo<\/i> and 4T1 KO BNIP3L\/NIX tumor cells had significantly reduced ability to migrate and invade <i>in vitro<\/i>. Furthermore, CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated deletion of HIF1&#945; a in the 4T1 cell model reduced Vimentin expression in a manner dependent on BNIP3L\/NIX expression. These results indicate that BNIP3L\/NIX acts as an oncogene downstream of HIF1&#945; in breast cancer by promoting expression of key EMT genes, stimulating tumor cell proliferation and migration, and that targeting BNIP3L\/NIX might prove an effective strategy in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0361d9e2-93fa-4489-a24e-9d39d318c1e6\/@v03B8ZM1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Breast cancer,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11778"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Damian E.

Aberrant &#946;-catenin signaling is found to play a critical role in differentiation grades of HCC patients. Thus, attempts to find more potent and non-toxic &#946;-Catenin inhibitors is urgently needed for cancer therapy. Notably, ormeloxifene (ORM), clinically approved selective estrogen receptor modulator with therapeutic index, has shown excellent anticancer activity, rendering it as an ideal candidate for repurposing. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer potential of ORM against hepatocellular carcinoma.<br \/>Methodology: Cell proliferation and colony formation assays were performed to assess the therapeutic activity of ORM in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2, SK-HEP-1, Hep3B, and C3A) cells. Boyden chamber and Matrigel assays were carried out for investigating the effect of ORM on migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells, respectively. The effects of ORM on &#946;-catenin and EMT associated proteins were analyzed through Western blotting and qPCR. Confocal microscopy was used to determine the &#946;-catenin nuclear localization following ORM treatment in HCC cells.<br \/>Results: As compared to vehicle-treated group, ORM treatment (2.5-20 &#181;M) suppressed proliferation and colony formation in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Moreover, ORM treatment suppresses the migration and invasion of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells as shown by wound healing and Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. ORM effectively inhibited the protein levels and mRNA expression of total &#946;-catenin. Additionally, our confocal microscopy results further showed reduced nuclear translocation of &#946;-catenin following the ORM treatment. ORM treatment inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process as evident by repression of N-cadherin, Slug, Snail, vimentin, MMPs (MMP2 and MMP3), and induced the expression of pGSK3&#946;. Experiments are also being conducted to see how ORM affects epigenetic markers linked to EMT and &#946;-catenin signaling.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, ORM inhibited &#946;-catenin signaling and exhibited potent anticancer effects against HCC and could be investigated further as a novel therapeutic modality for HCC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,&#946;-catenin,Cancer progression,Cadherin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11779"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohammed Sikander<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shabnam Malik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anyssa Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Molly Vela<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Zubieta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivek K.

The metastatic process involves epithelial cells losing their cellular polarity, adhesion to the basement membrane, and acquiring migratory and invasive properties. Metastatic epithelial cells take on a mesenchymal phenotype, hence this process is termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is characterized by a reduction in epithelial cell marker expression (E-cadherin, cytokeratin 8, and cytokeratin 18), and an increased expression of mesenchymal cell markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin). Previous studies have demonstrated that dietary intake of &#947;-tocotrienol and\/or vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> may provide benefit in the preventing the growth and development of metastatic breast cancer. &#947;-Tocotrienol is a natural isoform of vitamin E that shows potent anticancer activity against a variety of cancer cell types at treatment doses that have little or no effect on normal cell growth or viability. Vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> has also been shown to display potent antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity against human breast cancer cells, particularly triple negative breast cancers. Studies were conducted here to examine the effects of &#947;-tocotrienol and vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> given alone or in combination on MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cellular proliferation, migration, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Treatment with 10-16 &#181;M &#947;-tocotrienol or 20-40 nM vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> induced a significant dose-responsive decrease in MDA-MB-231 growth after a 4-day culture period. Combined treatment with sub-effective doses of &#947;-tocotrienol (8 &#956;M) and vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> (10 nM) induced a synergistically inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell growth, as determined isobologram analysis. Studies using the matrigel invasion assay showed that similar combination treatment with subeffective doses of &#947;-tocotrienol and vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub>, significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 motility. These effects appear to result from a reversal in EMT. Western blot analysis shows that combined treatment resulted in an increased expression of the epithelial cell markers E-cadherin, cytokeratins 8 and cytokeratins 18 and a corresponding reduction in mesenchymal cell markers N-cadherin and vimentin.

The hallmark of ILC is the genetic loss of E-cadherin (<i>CDH1<\/i>) causing the disruption of adherens junctions and resulting in discohesive, linear growth of ILC cells in tissues. Beyond its effects on this unique histology, there is limited data on the role of E-cadherin loss in ILC metastasis. Therefore, we generated three ILC cell lines (MDA-MB-134, SUM44PE and BCK4) with inducible E-cadherin overexpression. Using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy we confirmed E-cadherin expression, re-expression of other adherens junction proteins including &#945; and &#946;-catenin, and re-localization of cytoplasmic p120-catenin to the membrane. Successful cell adhesion to E-cadherin coated plates suggested formation of functional junctions. E-cadherin expression had no effect on 2D growth but did diminish cell growth in ultra-low attachment (ULA) conditions consistent with its previously described role in anoikis. We confirmed increased cell death of MM134 with E-cadherin overexpression compared to control cells when grown in ULA. Overexpression of E-cadherin failed to rescue poor migratory and invasive ability of ILC cell lines as measured by transwell assays. However, E-cadherin expression in SUM44PE lead to decreased haptotaxis to collagen I, and altered morphology from loose grape-like structure to tight sphere-like formation when embedded in collagen I.In vivo analyses revealed reduced primary tumor formation in E-cadherin-overexpression SUM44PE cells after mammary fat pad injection. Additional studies aimed at understanding E-cadherin&#8217;s effect on in vivo metastasis are ongoing.Collectively, our studies using novel cell line models will lead to an improved understanding of the hallmark loss of E-cadherin and disease mechanisms in ILC, which we hope will ultimately enable the development of more effective therapies and improve the outcome of patients with this understudied histological subtype of breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a0200709-8cbd-4eb1-9f23-c19671c6327f\/@w03B8ZM2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,invasive lobular carcinoma,E-cadherin,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11796"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laura Savariau<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nilgun Tasdemir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashuvinee Elangovan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pooja Sree Tallapaneni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jagmohan Hooda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer M.

Recently, the heterogenous expression of the driving fusion gene EWS-FLI1, as well as canonical Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling activity has been increasingly recognized as a potential mediator of metastatic progression. However, targeting the pathway has been difficult due to its complexity and cross-activity, and not much is known of the mechanism of how ES cells maintain Wnt signaling heterogeneity. Cadherin-11 (CDH11) is a member of the cadherin super-family, which modulates calcium ion-dependent cell-cell adhesion and signal transduction, and is highly expressed in ES. CDH11 has been found to regulate the expression level of &#946;-catenin, and play a key role in enhancing the stem cell, migration and invasion in other carcinomas, however the relationship between CDH11 and &#946;-catenin in ES is not clear.<br \/>Methods: Wnt\/&#946;-catenin dependent transcriptional activity of ES cells in vitro and in vivo were assessed by flow cytometry, immune fluorescence, as well as single cell RNA-seq. &#946;-catenin and CDH11 knock-down cell lines were generated, and affected on invasion\/migration, and metastatic progression was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the interaction of CDH11 with &#946;-catenin, and the contribution of the protein-protein interaction to the heterogenous activation of Wnt\/&#946;-catenin was assessed by immunofluorescence, flowcytometry, Western blot, and co-immunoprecipitation.<br \/>Results: At baseline, only a small fraction of ES cells have activated Wnt\/&#946;-catenin dependent transcriptional activity both in vitro and in vivo, which can respond rapidly with Wnt ligand stimulation. &#946;-catenin knockdown reduced clonogenicity in vitro, and metastatic tumor burden in the orthotopic implantation amputation mouse model of ES. We further identified that most of the tested ES cells had abundant &#946;-catenin bound to CDH11 in the cell membrane, which would rapidly be released through the cytoplasm and into the nucleus within 2 hours of adding exogenous Wnt ligand. CDH11 knockdown reduced &#946;-catenin expression, rapid activation of signaling by Wnt ligands, and metastasis progression.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data suggests that the cell surface CDH11- &#946;-catenin complex contributes to the heterogenous and dynamic activation of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway in ES that drives ES metastasis. Targeting the CDH11- &#946;-catenin complex can present a novel strategy to interfere with Wnt driven metastasis in ES.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f3dbfe17-8807-4e9b-98ed-82b76b688170\/@w03B8ZM2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,&#946;-catenin,Cadherin,Wnt signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11798"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryota Shirai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tyler Biebighauser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Nelson-Taylor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avery Bodlak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Porfilio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deandra Walker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naoki Oike<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masanori Hayashi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recent studies document that tumour cells shed exosomes at considerably higher rates, and these exosomes play critical roles in several early and late events associated with tumour development and metastasis. Thus, circulating exosomes are emerging as a new paradigm of &#8216;liquid biopsy&#8217; for non-invasive cancer diagnosis. They have been reported to influence epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pathological states such as metastatic lung cancer. We successfully isolated exosomes from an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutated cell line (HCC827) and from serum of different lung cancer patients: EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma (N=5), wild-type adenocarcinoma (N=5), squamous (N=3) and serum of patients with no cancer (N=5) and analysed their effects on cells from an A549 cell line. By zymography, we observed that exosomes derived from the EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma patients contains significantly more MMP-9 and pro-MMP-9 than those derived from other patients. When incubated with A549 cells, all exosomes, derived from the EGFR mutated cell line and from patients (regardless of patient origin), induced an increase in MMP2 activity. However, the increase of MMP9 activity was seen only in A549 cells treated with exosomes derived from EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma patients and from the EGFR mutated cell line. MMPs are one of the major attributes that epithelial cells acquire after undergoing EMT. Respectively by a modified Boyden chamber assay and by wound healing assay, we showed, that EGFR-mutated exosomes treatment increases the invasive capacity (fold change of 1.7; p-value=0.0008) and the migratory capacity [CM1] of A549 and HBE4 E6\/E7 cells in an MMP-9 dependant pathway. By western blot and qPCR, we observed a significant increase of vimentin expression, a mesenchymal marker while retaining the epithelial characteristics as evidenced by the unaltered levels of E-cadherin and EPCAM. EMT is not a binary process but instead, cells often exhibit a spectrum of epithelial\/mesenchymal phenotype(s). Such hybrid cells can move collectively as clusters which is thought to enhance their invasive properties. By qPCR, we observed an increase of NRF2, P-cadherin and cytokeratin 14, markers of hybrid-EMT and collective migration. Our results suggest that exosomes derived from EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma serum could be a potential mediator of hybrid-EMT and tumour invasion and may provide insights into the mechanisms of lung cancer progression and metastasis. Further studies are required to precisely delineate these mechanisms and explore novel therapeutic avenues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e10f6c9b-981b-4640-b83a-0102d43886eb\/@w03B8ZM2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,EGFR,Invasion,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11799"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amina Jouida<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cormac McCarhty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurelie Fabre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allan Kelly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Parthiban Nadarajan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marissa O Callaghan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael P.

During EMT, epithelial cells lose apical-basal polarity, remodel intercellular junctions, and acquire migratory and invasive abilities as they become mesenchymal. Pathologically, EMT has been demonstrated to contribute to intravasation of metastatic tumor cells into the vasculature. Among the activators of EMT, TGF-&#946; has been shown to be most prevalent and is sufficient for experimental induction of EMT. Gap junctions, comprising connexin proteins, allow direct mechanical and metabolic coupling between adjacent cells, and represent a major intercellular structure altered during EMT. Connexin43 (Cx43) is a gap junction protein that has been implicated as both a tumor suppressor and enhancer depending on cancer stage. Our previous work revealed that despite losses in Cx43 gap junctions during EMT, mRNA and cytosolic levels of Cx43 protein increased. Such a shift of Cx43 to cytoplasmic pools has previously been observed in cancer progression and research suggests that non-junctional Cx43 can regulate the cytoskeleton, including microtubule stability. The C-terminus of Cx43 encompasses a tubulin binding domain which, while implicated in Cx43 trafficking, remains functionally poorly understood. We have identified a tumorigenic role for non-junctional Cx43 through its interaction with microtubules in glioma cancer stem cells. This led us to hypothesize that increased cytosolic Cx43 during EMT promotes Cx43-microtubule interaction to facilitate mobility and invasion of metastatic cancer cells. Using several independent TGF-&#946;-induced EMT models, we observe increased complexing of Cx43 and microtubules during EMT by super-resolution microscopy. To study the role of Cx43 interaction with microtubules during EMT, we generated Cx43 harboring mutations in the tubulin binding domain which were ectopically expressed by adenoviral transduction in Cx43 knockout CRISPR\/Cas9 epithelial cells. We find these Cx43 mutants fail to interact with microtubules compared to wild-type Cx43. Turning to TGF-&#946;-induced EMT, ablation of the Cx43\/microtubules interaction with these mutants is sufficient to decrease expression of mesenchymal markers and inhibit cell migration. We are currently investigating the effects of disrupting Cx43\/microtubule complexing <i>in vivo<\/i> with a breast cancer mouse model to further elucidate effects on tumor progression and metastasis. Given the complex relationship between connexins and cancer progression, our findings support targeting this pathological &#8216;non-junctional&#8217; Cx43 population specifically to limit metastatic disease, as Cx43 gap junction function is critical to normal tissue function and contributes to tumor suppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd8fb4b7-21f3-4d73-bc77-26be679e7453\/@w03B8ZM2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Microtubules,Metastasis,Cell migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11825"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aryo Sorayya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Wheeler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stacie Deaver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Young<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Zeitz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Smyth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samy Lamouille<\/i><\/presenter>.

Metastasis-initiating cells need to acquire beneficial traits including cell plasticity, immune evasion, dormancy state control and organ colonization. These characteristics can be summarized in broad terms into two main processes, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness. Hyaluronic acid (HA), an extracellular matrix component, is a crucial factor in regulating these processes in PDAC, but it is so far not successfully targetable. Analyzing publicly available databases by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a signature related to HA binding was enriched in tumor samples compared to normal tissue. Hyaluronan And Proteoglycan Link Protein 1 (HAPLN1) was the top contributor to the enrichment score, being the 8th most enriched gene overall. We found that higher HAPLN1 expression correlated with shorter overall survival and that HAPLN1high patients had both, basal subtype and EMT signatures enriched. Moreover, these patients had a signature for peritoneal metastasis significantly enriched, suggesting a higher risk for peritoneal carcinomatosis. To study the role of HAPLN1 on PDAC in vitro, we stably overexpressed HAPLN1 in the murine PDAC cell line KPC. KPC-HAPLN1 cells expressed more EMT markers, more stem-related genes and changed the proteoglycan production from Aggrecan to Versican, which is known to be pro-metastatic. We found that spheroid formation, a feature of stemness, was improved in KPC-HAPLN1 vs KPC. Additionally, embedding these spheroids into matrigel led to an increased invasion of KPC-HAPLN1 cells. KPC-HAPLN1 cells improved KPC cell invasion capacities when co-cultured, indicating a paracrine effect. In vivo, intraperitoneal injection of luciferase expressing KPC cells resulted in higher luciferase activity when tumor cells expressed HAPLN1. Analyzing the peritoneal lavage (PL) from these mice, we obtained significantly more tumor cells in KPC-HAPLN1 injected mice. RNAseq data of tumor cells isolated from tumor nodules and PL showed that KPC-HAPLN1 cells acquired an increased metastatic potential and a strong immunomodulatory phenotype. Thus, we evaluated the immune cell composition of the PL by flow cytometry. Neutrophil and monocyte percentages were drastically reduced in KPC-HAPLN1 bearing mice. On the contrary, these mice had a significant increase in macrophages, which showed a reduction in pro-inflammatory gene expression. We conclude that HAPLN1 expression in tumor cells promotes a hyperplastic phenotype that facilitates invasion and colonization of the peritoneum, among others by creation of a pro-tumoral immune microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b90cf22-149f-4ebe-b1ca-b5657b862b85\/@w03B8ZM2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hyaluronan,Tumor invasion,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Stemness,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11826"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lena Wiedmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca De Angelis Rigotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nuria Vaquero-Siguero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Donato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Espinet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Trumpp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Fischer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Juan Rodriguez-Vita<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

CSCs cause tumor recurrence, chemoresistance and metastasis. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotes tumor cell migration, invasion and cancer stem cell properties. The Wnt signaling pathway is a major driver of cancer stemness and is regulated by the TCF\/LEF family of transcription factors. Using loss and gain of function of TCF7 (TCF1) in mouse and human breast cancer cells, we were able to demonstrate that TCF7 promotes cancer stemness through striking regulation of the EMT process. TCF7 knockdown in PyMT mammary tumor cells induced luminal epithelial differentiation, resulting in inhibition of oncosphere formation, migration, tumor growth and lung colonization. However, in keeping with a changing view of EMT as a strictly binary process, we found that TCF7 shifts tumor cells towards a hybrid epithelial\/mesenchymal state (E\/M) rather than a mesenchymal (M) state. This E\/M population was shown to carry stemness and metastatic properties and to be interestingly represented by a small &#8220;stem-like&#8221; subpopulation in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Using CD44 and CD104 (integrin &#946;4) flow cytometry to isolate E\/M cells from normal MCF10A and basal-like MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, we show that TCF7, Snail, and GSK3&#946; phosphorylation were all highly enriched in this population whereas Zeb-1 (a marker of mesenchymal cells), was absent from E\/M cells. These data support a model whereby TCF7 potentiates Wnt signaling which in turn activates GSK3&#946; phosphorylation, resulting in Snail upregulation and enrichment of cells in the E\/M state that is conducive of stemness and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f361378e-c573-4d17-ae59-118d19e4f99c\/@w03B8ZM2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Cancer stem cells,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11827"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huizhi Liang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Outhiriaradjou Benard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zuen Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimita Suyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Larry Norton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel B.

Multiple EMT states and great phenotypic plasticity have also been described, indicating the need for in-depth characterization of biological properties associated with different EMT phenotypes. The so-called hybrid phenotype, characterized by presence of both mesenchymal and epithelial markers, might in fact identify cancer cells with enhanced metastatic propensity.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Materials and Methods: <\/b>To assess the metastatic potential of different EMT phenotypes, we exploited two lung cancer cell lines with different properties (A549\/epithelial and LT73\/hybrid) and generated their respective sublines through four sequential rounds of <i>in vitro<\/i> migration assay (named M4). TGF&#946; treatment was also used to induce EMT. With a previously validated score based on the ratio between expression of epithelial (CDH1) or mesenchymal genes (SNAI2), cells were classified as: epithelial (A549)&#62;hybrid (A549-M4, LT73)&#62;mesenchymal (LT73-M4, A549-TGF&#946;). The disseminating\/metastatic properties of the different lines were tested <i>in vivo<\/i> by subcutaneous and tail-vein injections in SCID mice. Interaction with NK cells (NKs), known to specifically target EMT cancer cells, was also assessed.<br \/><b>Results and Discussion: <\/b>Compared to parental cells, M4 cells showed up-regulation of EMT-associated genes, expansion of the subset of CD133+ lung cancer stem cells (CSC) and displayed <i>in vivo<\/i> higher ability to disseminate from primary tumors to murine lungs (2-fold change, p=0.004). However, hybrid cells (LT73 and A549-M4) showed an increased ability to generate overt lung metastases in experimental metastasis assays compared to either epithelial (A549) or mesenchymal cells (LT73-M4 and A549-TGF&#946;). The higher metastatic ability of hybrid cells was correlated with CSCs expansion and reduced NKs infiltration to the metastatic lungs. Expression of IL-8, a cytokine involved in NKs recruitment, was decreased in hybrid cells and they were less prone to chemoattract NKs <i>in vitro<\/i> compared to both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Finally, <i>in vivo<\/i> prevention of NKs recruitment to the lungs using a neutralizing antibody, massively increased metastasis formation and expansion of CSCs in mice injected i.v. with mesenchymal A549-TGF&#946; (p=0.0006), but had limited effects in groups injected with both epithelial A549 and hybrid A549-M4.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our data indicate that the hybrid phenotype correlates with the highest metastatic potential related to efficient cancer cell dissemination, increased induction of stemness features and ability to avoid NKs recruitment. Conversely, fully mesenchymal cells show limited metastatic potential, possibly due the control exerted by NKs on their CSC subsets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cab2419f-f61c-43b1-8d17-b006aba5b750\/@w03B8ZM2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Natural killer cells,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Metastatic potential,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11828"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Giulia Bertolini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Parodi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massimo Milione<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabio Murianni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Centonze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giulia Taiè<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriella Sozzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massimo Vitale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Luca Roz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, targeting EMT has been challenging due to the complex and redundant EMT signaling pathways. Moreover, EMT inhibition would unequivocally promote its reversed process, mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), which also favors malignancy progression. To solve this EMT targeting paradox, we proposed to target the ability of tumor cells to oscillate between epithelial and mesenchymal states, the epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), which encompasses both EMT and MET. Using a Snail<sup>Cre-ERT2<\/sup> mediated EMT lineage-tracing model, we confirmed the involvement of EMP in chemoresistant metastasis of breast cancer. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of tumor cells in the transitioning phases of EMT or MET consistently revealed that ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) was specifically elevated regardless of their destined phenotypical fates. Further analyses delineated that the upregulation of RiBi and the subsequent nascent protein synthesis via the intensified ERK and mTOR signalings were vital for cancer cells to transit between epithelial and mesenchymal states. Importantly, inhibiting the excessive RiBi by either genetic or pharmacological means impaired EMP, as both EMT and MET processes were impeded, leading to significantly reduced metastatic outgrowth of chemoresistant tumor cells. Our studies revealed that elevated RiBi is required for tumor cells to &#8220;Ping Pong&#8221; between epithelial and mesenchymal states. Targeting the EMP via RiBi inhibition provides a feasible strategy to improve therapies for advanced breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Chemoresistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11829"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yi Ban<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenjuan Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yue Zou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharrell B, Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianting Sheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuliang Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen T.C.

Individual tumor cells exhibit heterogeneous features and growth potentials within the same tumor that may influence metastasis formation. During the metastatic cascade, tumor cells adapt their phenotype to various microenvironments that are distinct from their original site resulting in heterogeneous metastatic cells that often are resistant to conventional treatment. The underlying mechanisms of why some tumor cells can give rise to metastases, whereas others cannot are remarkably poorly understood.<br \/>We established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of breast cancer with different metastatic potential and preserved tumor heterogeneity. We analyzed the intrinsic cellular programs of individual tumor cells that influence the metastatic potential of breast cancers using different single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols (MULTI-Seq and Smart-Seq2). Using gene expression profiling of matched primary tumor and metastatic cells of 13 human breast cancers, we demonstrated that while human tumors showed profound inter-patient heterogeneity, they also shared signatures of differentially expressed genes between primary tumor and metastatic cells. Tumors with similar metastatic capabilities shared similar signatures, suggesting potential targets to directly treat metastasis. Additionally, we found that the plasticity of tumor cells is a common feature across tumors that is beneficial for the formation of metastasis. Tumors with higher levels of plastic tumor cells have a greater ability to form metastases. Moreover, we identified a subset of tumor cells expressing both markers of epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, demonstrating <i>in-vivo<\/i> evidence for tumor epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) in the metastatic cascade. The EMP is a continuum of states with epithelial and mesenchymal cell states as the two extremes of this continuum. The identified transition cells express distinct markers suggesting that these cells may represent a novel and overlooked cell type within the EMP continuum. Given the importance of tumor plasticity in the metastatic cascade, inhibiting the subset of tumor cells that are currently undergoing EMP may represent a novel treatment strategy for metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/acd18f61-b51f-44dd-8097-9d6eb028724a\/@w03B8ZM2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11830"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juliane Winkler<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weilun Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela O.

Overexpression of <i>MCAM<\/i> is associated with triple-negative breast cancer, decreased patient survival, and induces vimentin and slug indicative of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, breast cancer cell lines overexpressing <i>MCAM<\/i> show an increase in migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis.<sup> <\/sup>Given that overexpressed MCAM causes increased migration and invasion in multiple cancer types, MCAM could be one of the major contributors to recent studies showing increased metastatic phenotypes with certain cancer treatments. Decitabine (5-Aza-dC) is a chemotherapeutic used for acute myeloid leukemias with clinical trials underway for breast cancer use. 5-Aza-dC results in the depletion of DNA methyltransferase and acts as a demethylating agent. In 2019, 5-Aza-dC was reported to increase mRNA and protein levels of MCAM in various breast cancer cell lines, followed by an increase in EMT markers. Studies suggest that 5-Aza-dC treatment in chemo-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines results in increased EMT markers as well as increased invasion and migration. Microtubules are a very common target of multiple cancer therapies. However, the impact of 5-Aza-dC and MCAM on the microtubule network and non-adherent cells has not been well studied. We set out to explore changes in microtentacle (McTN), cell attachment and clustering, and microtubule modifications due to 5-Aza-dC treatment and <i>MCAM<\/i> expression. Treatment of MCF10A, MCF10A variants, and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines with 5-Aza-dC showed consistent increases in the expression of <i>MCAM<\/i>. When exploring the effects of 5-Aza-dC treatment on the cytoskeleton, specifically microtubules, it was found that there is a significant increase in acetyl tubulin and detyrosinated tubulin, two common microtubule modifications correlated with an increase of McTNs. However, there was not a significant increase in the number of cells with McTNs in treated cells. Since McTNs can aid in attachment and cell clustering, attachment assays and clustering assays were performed after 5-Aza-dC treatment. These experiments showed that 5-Aza-dC decreased the ability of all cell lines to attach and impeded these cells' ability to form clusters. While there are emerging concerns that Decitabine can increase metastatic phenotypes of migration and invasion in adherent cells, our results indicate that within a non-adherent environment, Decitabine reduces the metastatic phenotypes of clustering and reattachment. Ongoing experiments focus on testing the impact of stable genetic alterations in these cell lines to examine the specific impact of <i>MCAM <\/i>overexpression<i> <\/i>on the microtubule network and metastatic potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6eaa55e8-08f7-46d0-b43f-177ea10c734a\/@o03B8ZM3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastatic potential,Microtubules,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11834"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Annis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keyata Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Makenzy Mull<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trevor Mathias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Vitolo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stuart Martin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite recent improvements in therapy, drug resistant populations emerge even in drug-sensitive tumors. The ability to adapt to multiple types of stress contributes to tumor progression and therapy resistance. We have found a subset of melanoma cells with high Wnt5A and wild type p53 expression can transition to a slow-cycling state, rendering them resistant to most targeted therapy. Multiple types of stress, including DNA damage, targeted therapy, and aging increase Wnt5A and p53 in these metastatic cells. Inhibiting p53 blocks the slow cycling phenotype and promotes sensitivity to targeted therapy. A single dose of a p53 inhibitor at the commencement of BRAF\/MEKi therapy was sufficient to prolong sensitivity to BRAF\/MEKi therapy in Yumm1.7 derived tumors grown in aged mice (&#62; 52 weeks). Upon analysis of PDX tumors with WTp53, treated with BRAF\/MEKi combination or BRAFi therapy, we observed an increase in p53 positive cells as well as an increase in Wnt5A expression, further linking Wnt5A and p53 with resistance to targeted therapy. These data suggest that melanoma cells require p53 to survive multiple types of stress and that taking the paradoxical approach of inhibiting rather than activating WTp53 may sensitize previously resistant metastatic melanoma cells to therapy by temporarily driving them into a rapidly cycling state. WTp53 is typically thought of as a tumor suppressor due to its ability to regulate cell proliferation, stress response, and cell death. However, in metastatic melanoma cells, p53 promotes the expression of EDIL3, FAP, MMP3, and netrin G1, which are associated with poor prognosis, increased angiogenesis, and metastasis in multiple types of cancer. These data suggest that p53, typically thought of as a tumor suppressor, may be promoting the survival of a subset of highly resistant metastatic cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a3364f6-d8d1-4c6d-9e1e-6c582ec7b4c0\/@o03B8ZM3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Metastasis,Therapy resistance,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11867"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jasmin Giles<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Biancaniello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Fane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gretchen Alicea<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Kossenkov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanpreet Kaur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vito Rebecca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaowei Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meenhard Herlyn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maureen Murphy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashani Weeraratna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Marie R.

The TNBC subtype has no effective molecular targeted therapies. Gene expression studies have identified a subset of TNBC that is enriched with androgen receptors (AR) and androgen receptor signaling. AR levels are most abundant in the luminal AR (LAR) molecular subtype of TNBC, but other non-LAR molecular TNBC subtypes also display high levels of AR expression and activity. Interference with androgen signaling in TNBC with AR-inhibiting drugs have shown a reduction in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal-like stem cells. Approximately one-third of TNBC expressed AR, and evaluation of AR-positive TNBC primary tumors shows nuclear localization of AR, an indication of transcriptionally active receptors. Previous studies have shown that AR inhibition or AR knockdown significantly reduces migration and invasion and EMT in different TNBC cell lines. &#947;-Tocotrienol is a member of the vitamin E family of compounds that displays potent anticancer effects and have little or no effect on normal cell viability. Studies show that treatment with 0-7 &#181;M &#947;-tocotrienol reduced AR levels, proliferation, migration and invasion in a dose-responsive manner in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA MB-453 cell lines. Results also show that treatment with 5 &#181;M (MDA-MB-231) and 7 &#181;M (MDA-MB-453) &#947;-tocotrienol induced a reversal in EMT cell biomarkers, as well as reversal in EMT morphological and behavioral characteristics in these TNBC cell lines. Western blot analysis show that similar treatment with &#947;-tocotrienol significantly decreased DHT-induced N-cadherin (mesenchymal cell biomarker) and increased expression in cytokeratin 18 and E-cadherin (epithelial cell biomarkers) in these cells. AR signaling is known to play an important role in stimulating DHT-induced EMT by stimulating the STAT3\/Snail signaling pathway in MDA-MB231. However, results in the present study shows that &#947;-tocotrienol treatment significantly inhibited activation of STAT3 and Snail proteins. Additional immunocytochemistry experiments showed that &#947;-tocotrienol treatment significantly inhibited DHT-induced cytoskeleton changes in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA MB-453 cell lines. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that &#947;-tocotrienol treatment inhibits AR expression and DHT-dependent EMT and cytoskeleton changes in TNBC cells. These findings suggest that AR may be a potential therapeutic target for treating both LAR and non-LAR TNBC subtypes.

Redox regulation of the tumor phenotype by GPx2 knockdown (KD) in breast cancer led us to uncover dramatic effects on spontaneous metastasis. Analysis of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from GPx2 KD tumor and control tumor, revealed that both tumors were comprised of several luminal-like tumor cell clusters and one mesenchymal-like cell cluster (cluster 3). Notably, GPx2 KD promoted a significant increase in the size of mesenchymal cells (cluster 3) relative to control, which might be due to the stimulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to GPx2 loss. In support of this view, GPx2 KD stimulated an increase in mRNA expression of basal\/mesenchymal (KRT5, KRT14, KRT17, Vimentin, Twist1, Twist2, CDH2) genes and a decrease in mRNA expression of epithelial\/luminal (Cldn7 and Epcam) genes, especially in cluster 3. Moreover, GPx2 KD upregulated mRNA expression of basal\/mesenchymal (Twist2, CDH2, and KRT14) genes in most luminal-like clusters expressing epithelial\/luminal (Epcam, Cldn3\/7, CDH1, KRT8\/18) genes, implying these clusters may be undergoing EMT transition in a hybrid epithelial\/mesenchymal state in response to GPx2 loss. Validation of these data in cell lines and tumors showed that GPx2 KD dramatically enhanced EMT via<i> <\/i>activation of ROS\/HIF1&#945;-mediated signaling. Importantly, these effects were reversed by GPx2 re-expression or HIF1&#945; inhibition, which was capable of suppressing EMT and metastasis. Collectively, these results indicate that GPx2 loss promotes breast cancer metastasis by stimulating EMT due to HIF1&#945; signaling, highlighting the impact of GPx2 and HIF1 on therapeutic intervention in metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10090d51-e6c6-468a-898f-301633d31a6b\/@o03B8ZM3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Redox,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11877"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zuen Ren<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huizhi Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malindrie Dharmaratne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miriam Morales-Gallego<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atefeh Taherian Fard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Mar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimita Suyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Outhiriaradjou Benard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael B.

Recently, it was shown that CTC clearance following specific therapies may predict chemosensitivity in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. However, a limited amount of CTC research is available in TNBC due to the inability of epitope-dependent CTC platforms to capture CTCs in a sufficient proportion of patients, especially when evaluating non-metastatic patients (Stage I-III). ANGLE has developed a Research Use Only (RUO) workflow including the Parsortix&#174; system, an epitope-independent micro&#64258;uidic device that isolates and harvests rare cells from blood based on their size and deformability, followed by an immunofluorescent (IF) assay for the identification and characterization of CTCs. This five-color multiplex IF assay enables the identification of both epithelial and mesenchymal CTCs as well as the investigation of other targets of interest on the CTCs.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 7.5mL of peripheral blood drawn into a Streck CellFree DNA Blood Collection Tube from 11 TNBC patients (four Stage IV and seven Stage IIIa) was processed on Parsortix&#174; system between 96 and 144 hours post collection. Harvested CTCs were cytospun onto a charged slide and immunofluorescently stained using an optimised antibody panel allowing for detection of epithelial and mesenchymal CTCs. Stained slides were imaged using a BioView Allegro Plus automated imaging system.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> CTCs were identified in 9 (82%) of the 11 TNBC patients, with a median of 6 and mean of 30 CTCs identified per patient. CTC clusters were harvested by the Parsortix&#174; system and were observed in the majority (8\/9) of the CTC-positive patients. Cluster size ranged from 2-68 CTCs per cluster, and the number of clusters per patient ranged from 1-50. Phenotypically, a large proportion of the CTCs identified expressed only mesenchymal markers (80%), with the remainder expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal markers (20%). In 6 of the 7 non-metastatic (Stage IIIa) patients, high numbers of CTC clusters were detected. Lower numbers of CTC clusters were detected in 3 (75%) of the 4 metastatic (Stage IV) patients.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This study demonstrated the ability of ANGLE&#8217;s multiplex IF assay to detect and phenotype CTCs. The proportion of non-metastatic TNBC patients found to have CTCs was much higher compared to previous reports using epitope-dependent systems (82% vs 25%). This highlights the advantages of epitope-independent CTC capture in TNBC. ANGLE&#8217;s RUO Parsortix&#174; system and multiplex IF assay provide an efficient solution for the harvesting and characterization of multiple CTC phenotypes, with the added advantage of being able to process the blood between 96 and 144 hours post collection, allowing for the shipment of samples at room temperature for centralised analysis in support of global clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f12aa412-7983-4be7-a068-5b94f6593075\/@o03B8ZM3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11890"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Amina Mezni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Hardy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mariacristina Ciccioli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Sophie Pailhes-Jimenez<\/i><\/presenter>.
