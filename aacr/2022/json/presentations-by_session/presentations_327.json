[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) regulate apoptosis and modulate NF-kB signaling, which in turn drives the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Xevinapant (XVT) (a.k.a Debio 1143) is an orally available IAP antagonist shown to enhance tumor response to radiation through the proapoptotic cytokine TNF&#945; and caspase activation. Results from a double-blind, multicenter, randomized, phase II trial in patients with high-risk locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN) revealed significant improvement in overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and duration of response with XVT in combination with high-dose cisplatin chemoradiotherapy (CRT) vs CRT alone (NCT02022098). We analyzed XVT pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker time-concentration profiles and explored the association of PD changes over time with clinical efficacy and safety parameters.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Three serum PD biomarkers were measured during cycle 1: caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 fragment (CKM30), a biomarker of epithelial apoptosis, MCP1 and TNF&#945;, both NF-kB target genes. Time course changes in PD biomarker exposure, measured by their Area Under the Curve (AUC), were tested for association with clinical efficacy and safety endpoints, by linear, logistic, and Cox Proportional Hazard models. Clinical response parameters included locoregional control (LRC) at 18 months from end of treatment (EOT), PFS, duration of LRC, time to distant relapse (TTDR), OS and complete response (CR) 6 months after EOT.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The biomarker analysis set was composed of all patients with baseline PD assessments and at least one post-baseline measurement and included 35 and 40 patients in the XVT and placebo (PBO) arms, respectively. All three serum PD biomarkers increased upon administration of CRT + XVT during cycle 1. The increase in CKM30 and MCP1 levels was significantly higher in the CRT + XVT arm vs the CRT + PBO arm, as tested by linear mixed effect models (CKM30: p = 0.0167; MCP1: p = 0.0135). Interestingly, CKM30 AUC appeared to be correlated with response in CRT + XVT but not CRT + PBO (based on LRC at month 18 or CR at month 6). No associations between any of the three biomarkers were observed with the safety endpoints explored.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Xevinapant has demonstrated promising activity in combination with CRT in LA-SCCHN. The outcome of the exploratory PD analyses indicates that XVT modulates NF-kB signaling, leading to serum increases in MCP1 and TNF&#945; while further augmenting CRT-induced apoptotic marker CKM30. Our findings further characterize the mechanism of action of XVT and how it may ultimately result in enhanced clinical responses to CRT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ea54de7-199f-4357-9805-cb833b79c15a\/@u03B8ZCi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacodynamics,IAP,Chemosensitization,Radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12116"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luke Piggott<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruno Gavillet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Franck Brichory<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathrin Gollmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florilene Bouisset<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregoire Vuagniaux<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, we hypothesized that defective antigen presentation contributes to immune resistance, and a sequential therapy comprising of ablative radiation therapy (RT) and agonist &#945;CD40 antibody can reprogram the tumor-infiltrating myeloid and dendritic cells for effective <i>in-situ<\/i> tumor antigen presentation and activation of T cells. Palpable B16-F10-<i>Res499<\/i> tumors in C57BL\/6 mice, resistant to the systemic effects of RT and &#945;CTLA-4 blockade, were treated with 3 fractions of 20Gy (RT) followed by agonist &#945;CD40 antibody (3x100&#956;g). Tumor growth, survival, and anti-tumoral immune memory after rechallenge was monitored. Mice were sacrificed on Day 16 post-RT, and immune cells from irradiated tumors and draining lymph nodes (DLN) were analyzed using flow cytometry. There was complete tumor regression and enhanced anti-tumoral immune memory in RT+&#945;CD40-treated animals. In a dual tumor model, combination therapy significantly delayed abscopal tumor growth by 64% on D30 (p&#60;0.0001). When compared to unirradiated or tumors treated with RT alone, there was a significant increase in cell surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40 and 4-1BBL) and TNF-&#945;, and iNOS in the CD103<sup>+ <\/sup>DCs and myeloid cells (p&#60;0.05) indicating a reprogramming of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory function in MDSCs. There was an increase in CD8+ T cells with reduced CD4\/CD8 ratio (p&#60;0.01) in abscopal tumors and DLN in the RT+&#945;CD40 group. Combination treatment enhanced the frequency of proliferating Ki67<sup>+<\/sup> (p&#60;0.001) and IFN&#947;<sup>+ <\/sup>(p&#60;0.01) CD8 T cells and an increase in the Ki67<sup>+ <\/sup>high GRZ<sup>+<\/sup> (granzyme secreting) population in the pool of early exhausted cells (PD1<sup>int<\/sup>EOMES<sup>low<\/sup>). Interestingly CD8 depletion by anti-CD8 only partially reversed the effect of the combination group. Furthermore, &#945;CD40 showed an increase in the CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>Ly6C population in the tumors. Also, Ly6C depletion completely reversed the effect of the IR+anti-CD40 treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Combination of ablative RT, followed by &#945;CD40 therapy, overcame immune resistance in murine melanoma by enhancing systemic anti-tumoral immunity, abscopal effects, survival, and anti-tumoral immune memory. The immunomodulatory effects of &#945;CD40 are dependent upon Ly6C<sup>+ <\/sup>cells and partially on CD8+ T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6457d3ab-07df-483a-a9bd-fd346b46e5fe\/@u03B8ZCi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-05 Radiation-immunotherapy and other radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioimmunotherapy,Resistance,CD40,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12117"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanjay Pandey<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia G.

We evaluated associations between IPLC radiotherapy and the risks of SPLC and overall mortality among lung cancer survivors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We identified 689,785 patients diagnosed with IPLC in 1988-2013 from SEER. We applied cause-specific Cox (CSC) regression to evaluate association between IPLC radiotherapy and SPLC risk, adjusting for age at IPLC diagnosis, IPLC stage and histology, and prior history of cancer. To allow a latency period of exposure to IPLC radiotherapy on SPLC risk, we performed subgroup analyses restricted to patients who survived &#8805;5 and &#8805;10 years after IPLC diagnosis. Using Cox regression, we evaluated association between IPLC radiotherapy and overall mortality, adjusting for the same covariates used in the CSC analysis. Mediation analysis quantified the indirect effect of IPLC radiotherapy on overall mortality mediated through radiotherapy-driven SPLC diagnosis. Validation utilized data from 7,758 IPLC patients (496 SPLCs) at Mayo Clinic.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of 689,785 IPLC patients, 18,818 (2.7%) developed SPLC in SEER. IPLC patients treated with radiotherapy had a reduced SPLC risk versus non-irradiated patients when evaluated at the time of initial diagnosis (cause-specific hazard ratio [csHR]=0.90, P&#60;1x10<sup>-6<\/sup>). However, the association between IPLC radiotherapy and SPLC risk was reversed when analyses were restricted to those who survived at least 5 years (csHR=1.08, P=0.01) and 10 years (csHR=1.16, P=0.009), thus long-term survivors treated with IPLC radiotherapy having a significantly increased risk of SPLC. Mayo Clinic data showed consistent results, with the effect of IPLC radiotherapy increasing from csHR of 2.41 (P&#60;1x10<sup>-6<\/sup>) to 3.38 (P=0.001) among 5-year and 10-year survivors, respectively. Similarly, compared to non-irradiated patients, those treated with IPLC radiotherapy showed a significantly increased risk of overall mortality among 10-year survivors (hazard ratio [HR]=1.46, P&#60;1x10<sup>-6<\/sup> in SEER and HR=1.54, P=5.1X10<sup>-5<\/sup> in Mayo Clinic). Mediation analysis showed that a substantial proportion of the total effect of IPLC radiotherapy on overall mortality&#8212;ranging from 32% to 59%&#8212;was due to radiotherapy-driven SPLC among 10-year survivors in SEER and Mayo Clinic.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> IPLC radiotherapy is associated with increased risks of SPLC and overall mortality, with its effects more pronounced among long-term survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eb8316eb-c530-46f3-91d0-df8171d066fa\/@u03B8ZCi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Radiation-induced late effects\/second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Radiotherapy,Survival,Second Primary Lung Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12118"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eunji Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vicky T.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is effective in a minority of patients whose tumors harbor a pre-existing lymphocytic response. However, most UPS tumors have a myeloid infiltrate, a highly plastic cellular population with the potential to serve as a substrate for immunotherapy. Radiotherapy (RT), a standard therapy for UPS, can also drive myeloid cells into the tumor. Based on abundant expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by myeloid cells, we hypothesized that intratumoral injection of a PRR agonist would leverage pre-existing and RT-associated myeloid cells by redirecting them to prime adaptive anti-tumor immunity.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We used BO-112, a nanoplexed double-stranded ribonucleic acid that activates PRRs, most of which are not typically activated by RT. We used an ICB-resistant mouse model, in which tumor cells derived from a Kras<sup>G12D\/-<\/sup>P53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> model of UPS are used to establish large tumors in flanks of C57BL\/6J mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with RT (8 Gy x 3 fractions daily) starting on day 8 &#177; BO-112 (30 ug\/dose) on days 8 and 10. Tumor growth and survival between groups were compared by ANOVA and log-rank test, respectively. To test the role of lymphocytes, the study was repeated in RAG<sup>-\/-<\/sup>gc<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice. Kinetic analysis of myeloid and T cells was performed in the tumors and lymph nodes (LN) on days 15, 21, 26 using high-dimensional flow cytometry. To evaluate the fate of monocytes, LysM-eGFP monocytes were intratumorally transferred following treatment, with subsequent analysis of tumors and LNs on days 16, 18, 21.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Tumor control was significantly improved in the combination group starting from day 16 with mean tumor volume of 240 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in the combination group compared to 490 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in BO112, 790 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in RT, and 875mm<sup>3<\/sup> in mock groups (p&#60;0.0001) which translated into a maximal survival advantage in the combination group (p&#60;0.005). However, in RAG<sup>-\/-<\/sup>gc<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice, this benefit of combination therapy was completely negated. This therapeutic combination appeared to drive an early reduction in Ly6C<sup>hi<\/sup>MHCII<sup>+<\/sup> cells (p&#60;0.05) within the tumor followed by a progressive increase of the same population in the draining LN over time (p=0.01). In parallel, we observed trafficking of adoptively transferred intratumoral eGFP+ monocytes from the tumor to dLNs in response to BO-112 and RT.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Local-only therapy of BO-112 and RT yields a lymphocyte-dependent anti-tumor immune response in an immunotherapy-resistant model of UPS. Longitudinal analysis of locoregional immune responses and adoptive transfer experiments indicate that combination BO-112 and RT induces tumor-to-dLN myeloid trafficking that may bridge an adaptive response and confer therapeutic effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/12a14e19-1f41-4847-a668-af46bb97edef\/@u03B8ZCi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-05 Radiation-immunotherapy and other radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Monocyte,Radioimmunotherapy,Preclinical testing,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12119"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jie Deng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott C.

Randomized data provide a strong rationale for the treatment of high grade gliomas using TTFields with individualized array placement that maximizes the dose at the tumor in a patient-specific manner: providing higher TTFields intensity (&#8805;1.0 V\/cm) and power density (&#8805;1.1 mW\/cm<sup>3<\/sup>) which are associated with improved overall survival (Ballo, et al. <i>Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys<\/i>. 2019;104:1106-11). Here for the first time, we present a case demonstrating the use of numerical simulations for patient-specific TTFields treatment planning for a spinal tumor.<br \/>Methods: Treatment planning was performed for a 48 year old patient following T10-L1 laminectomy, gross total resection, and postoperative chemoradiation for an anaplastic astrocytoma of the spinal cord. An MRI at 3 weeks following chemoradiation showed tumor recurrence. Based on the post-chemoradiation MRI, a patient-specific model was created. The model was created by modifying a realistic computational phantom of a healthy female. To mimic the laminectomy, the lamina in T10-L1 was removed and the region was assigned an electric conductivity similar to that of muscle. A virtual mass was introduced into the spinal cord. Virtual transducer arrays were placed on the model at multiple positions, and delivery of TTFields simulated. The dose delivered by different transducer array layouts was calculated, and the layouts that yielded maximal dose to the tumor and spine identified.<br \/>Results: Combinations of the best layouts targeting the tumor (all above 2.5 mW\/cm<sup>3<\/sup>) and the best layouts targeting the spinal cord were investigated. Transducer array layouts where the arrays were placed on the back of the patient with one above the tumor and one below yielded the highest doses at the tumor site. Such layouts yielded TTFields doses of over 2.5mW\/cm3, which is well above the threshold dose of 1.1 mW\/cm3. Three such layouts were presented as possibilities for a recommended treatment plan. As patient usage, or time on treatment, is correlated with improved patient outcomes, an interactive process was followed to adjust the treatment so that it incorporates both increased therapeutic dose to the tumor and increased overall patient usage and comfort.<br \/>Conclusions: These data represent the first ever study on utilizing numerical simulations to plan treatment for a spinal tumor in a patient-specific manner. This is an important milestone in the development of a framework for TTFields dosimetry and treatment planning. This framework will have the potential to increase dose delivery to the tumor bed while optimizing placement that may enhance comfort and encourage device usage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/35640763-b9b8-45e6-b487-686d918a749b\/@u03B8ZCi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Astrocytoma,Tumor Treating Fields,TTFields,Treatment Planning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12120"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer De Los Santos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Smadar Arvatz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oshrit Zeevi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shay Levi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noa Urman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Shackelford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ariel Naveh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tal Marciano<\/i><\/presenter>.

The cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS)-STimulator of InterferoN Genes (STING) pathway is an essential regulator of IFN signaling in response to aberrant cytosolic DNA, including from tumors, and has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target. TAK-676 is a systemically delivered novel synthetic STING agonist that binds to and activates STING along with downstream IFN signaling, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose escalation study of patients with advanced tumors (NCT04420884). In addition, focal radiation treatment of tumors leads to cell death coupled with innate cell activation and antigen presentation, suggesting that combining STING activation with radiotherapy (+\/- anti-PD1) could lead to improved tumor control. The combination of TAK-676 with radiation +\/- anti-PD1 was explored in immunocompetent EMT6 tumor-bearing BALB\/c mice. Fractionated focal radiation (8Gy X 3) followed by TAK-676 (1 mg\/kg dosed Q3D X 3) resulted in complete regression (CR) of tumors in 6\/8 mice, whereas no CRs were detected in groups treated with radiation alone or with TAK-676 as a single agent. These observations suggest that addition of TAK-676 to a radiation regimen leads to enhanced tumor growth control compared to either treatment alone. In contrast, adding anti-PD1 to TAK-676 + fractionated radiation did not further increase tumor growth inhibition in this anti-PD1 resistant tumor model, with 5\/8 CRs detected. Rechallenge of mice achieving CRs with EMT6 tumors resulted in rejection of the tumors in 3\/5 and 4\/5 mice from the double and triple combinations regimens, respectively, suggesting establishment of immunologic memory following primary challenge and treatment. Pharmacodynamic studies found both TAK-676 (1mg\/kg) and fractionated radiation (8Gy X 3) monotherapy led to increased T cell accumulation and activation in the lymph nodes. However, only TAK-676 with fractionated radiation enhanced local IFN-&#947; production within the tumor, suggesting an enhanced adaptive immune response to this combination that drives the increase in observed efficacy. These studies support the evaluation of TAK-676 in combination with pembrolizumab following fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in a dose escalation clinical trial in patients with select advanced tumors (NCT04879849).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e07a53ca-b614-4b52-be1f-0d2c41129071\/@u03B8ZCi\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-05 Radiation-immunotherapy and other radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,STING,Radiation therapy,Pharmacodynamics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12121"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Vicky A.

However, a significant subset of these patients either fails to respond or eventually relapses. Moreover, patients who are candidates for CART-19 therapy often have symptomatic disease that requires some form of treatment to support them during the manufacture period. An ideal bridging therapy would simultaneously both (1) sensitize the tumor to CART-19 attack to increase antitumor control and (2) debulk the disease during manufacture. Radiotherapy (RT) is an established curative and palliative cancer treatment regimen, with approximately half of cancer patients with solid tumors receiving RT some time during their disease. Several reports have underscored the existence of threshold doses (and regimens) that are able to switch on different damage programs that profoundly affect responses to therapy by eliciting potent immune modulatory effects, prompting immunologically mediated tumor cell death. These effects have been attributed to multiple pathways, including the activation of the cGMP-cAMP Synthetase (cGAS), Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway with Type I Interferons expression, and tumor associated antigen (TAA) cross priming with anti-tumor CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell elicitation, ultimately inducing &#8220;abscopal&#8221; effects. By virtue of the immunomodulatory effects of RT, we hypothesize that RT could serve as a successful bridging strategy for CAR T-cell therapy. To investigate this hypothesis we established the A20 Lymphoma CART-19 therapy mouse model in our lab and use it to perform preliminaries experiments. A20 cells <i>were implanted<\/i> into both flanks of the animals. Mimicking human immune adjuvant dose used in our institute for RT bridging, 20 days after the A20 challenge we RT treated one of the two tumors using a dose of 8Gy divided in two fractions of 4Gy each. Twenty-four hours later 1x10ep6 CART-19 cells were infused intravenously. While the effects of RT in combination with CART-19 have similar impact on the tumor growth of the irradiated mass a significant increase of the antitumor effects of the single therapy was observed on the non-irradiated tumor. FACS studies demonstrated heavy leukocytes infiltration with increased presence of infused CART-19 as well indigenous T cells. To investigate possible molecular mechanisms involved in the increased effects on the non-irradiated tumor, we perform a qPCR array and observed increased expression of genes linked to cross priming, including IFN type I and Batf3. A20 cells express the ectopic retroviral antigen gp70 with well characterized AH1 immune-dominant epitope. AH1 tetramer staining on infiltrating T cells demonstrated increase staining in tumor from mice treated with the combination. Overall these results suggest RT may serve as optimal debulking and adjuvant bridging therapy for CAR-T cells therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad7faec3-ebb0-40fa-b63e-a81701dca702\/@u03B8ZCi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-05 Radiation-immunotherapy and other radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Radiation therapy,Antigen presentation,Adjuvant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12123"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Nektarios Kostopoulos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Costanitnos Koumeins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John P.

A recent study combining clinical data and simulations demonstrated that the simulation-based dose estimation at the tumor level is directly correlated with patient survival (Ballo M, et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2019;104(5):1106-1113). This study highlights the importance of computer-modelling based TTFields treatment planning in the clinic. Performing such planning in a meaningful manner requires an understanding about how inaccuracies in the patient model influence calculated TTFields distributions. In this study we show the effect of local perturbations in the model, errors in tumor segmentation, and inaccuracy in the patient head model on TTFields dose estimation.<br \/>Methods: Computational studies were performed with Sim4Life software. 1) Local model uncertainty outside of tumor region: To create defects in the models, conductive spheres with varying conductivities and radii were placed into the model&#8217;s brains at different distances from the tumor. Virtual transducer arrays were placed on the models, and delivery of TTFields numerically simulated. The error in the electric field induced by the defects as a function of defect conductivity, radius, and distance to tumor was investigated. 2) Tumor segmentation uncertainty: For illustrating segmentation errors in tumors and necrotic cores, layered spheres with various conductivities and radii were placed in different head locations. Tumor conductivity uncertainty was defined as (&#963;-&#963;<sub>ref<\/sub>)\/&#963;<sub>ref<\/sub> where &#963;<sub>ref<\/sub> = 0.24 S\/m is the standard tumor conductivity and &#963; is the varied conductivity over the tumor. The normalized tumor radius was calculated when each of the varied radii was normalized to the results obtained by all the other combinations.<br \/>Results: The results show that that when a defect of radius R is placed at a distance, d, from the tumor that is larger than seven times R, the error is below 1% regardless of the defect conductivity.<br \/>Conclusions: Our models and results show the impact of uncertainty in segmentation of the tumor or other tissue distant from it on the TTFields dose estimation. These results could serve as a guideline for model creation and tissue segmentation that would lead to optimal dose estimation in TTFields treatment planning.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0a9eabc-e94c-41eb-87f3-8e445a3a7388\/@v03B8ZCj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor,Tumor Treating Fields,TTFields,Computational Study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12124"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tal Marciano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oshrit Zeevi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zeev Bomzon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Previous evidence showed that lung cancer cells (LUCs) may escape from host immunity to form distant metastases. We previously used an original imaging model of brain metastasis (IBrM) to show a heterogeneous interaction between microglia, the tissue macrophages in the brain, and LUCs in the brain niche. The findings confirmed that microglia can phagocytose metastatic cancer cells. Here, we show that genetic deletion of the &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signals of cancer cells can promote phagocytic activity of microglia against LUCs. We injected an adenocarcinoma lung cancer cell line expressing mCherry (CMT167mC) via the internal carotid artery of the CX3CR1-EGFP mice, whose microglia had been specifically labeled with EGFP. The microglia and LUCs were visualized <i>in vivo<\/i> simultaneously by two-photon microscopy for 14 days. The tumor fate and microglial response against cancer cells were evaluated at single cell resolution in the IBrM. CD24, CD47, and\/or PDL1 were deleted in CMT167mC cells using CRISPR\/Cas9 to examine the effect of the &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signals. The dynamic behavior of LUCs and the microglial phagocytosis activity against LUCs were visualized in living mice. Microglial phagocytosis was significantly increased by single deletion of CD47 or CD24 compared with WT cells. Combined deletion of CD47 and CD24 also synergically increased microglial phagocytosis, resulting in reduced IBrM and prolonged mouse survival. By contrast, deletion of PD-L1 did not enhance microglial phagocytosis or prolong survival. The pharmacological or genetic conditional depletion of microglia canceled both the increased phagocytosis and the extended survival time, suggesting that the effect of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signals was microglia-dependent. These results indicate that suppression of both CD24 and CD47 in LUCs enhances microglial phagocytic activity and suppresses the metastatic formation of LUCs. Furthermore, the combined use of CRISPR\/Cas9 in LUCs and <i>in vivo<\/i> imaging allows us to evaluate potential therapeutic targets associated with microglial phagocytosis. We are currently using single cell RNA-seq and cell-to-cell communication analysis of the brain tumor and surrounding niche to explore other signal pathways that regulate tumor phagocytosis by microglia and to identify potential therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4ce7b0de-5243-4f1f-bedf-22754d28890a\/@v03B8ZCj\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Macrophages,Innate immunity,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12125"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Takahiro Tsuji<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroaki Wake<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariko Shindo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daisuke Kato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroaki Ozasa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toyohiro Hirai<\/i><\/presenter>.

Prior work has found that brain-seeking breast tumor cells display altered proteomic profiles, leading to alterations in pathways related to cell signaling, cell cycle, metabolism, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Given the unique microenvironmental characteristics of brain and bone tissue, we hypothesized that brain- or bone-seeking TNBC cells may have altered morphologic or migratory phenotypes from each other, or from the parental TNBC cells, as a function of the biochemical or mechanical microenvironment. In this study, we utilized TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231) that were conditioned to metastasize solely to brain (MDA-BR) or bone (MDA-BO) tissue. We quantified characteristics such as cell morphology, migration, and stiffness in response to cues that partially mimic their final metastatic niche. We have shown that MDA-BO cells have a distinct protrusive morphology not found in MDA-P or MDA-BR. Further, MDA-BO cells migrate over a larger area when on a collagen I (abundant in bone tissue) substrate when compared to fibronectin (abundant in brain tissue). However, migration in highly confined environments was similar across the cell types. Modest differences were found in the stiffness of MDA-BR and MDA-BO cells plated on collagen I vs. fibronectin-coated surfaces. Lastly, MDA-BO cells were found to have larger focal adhesion area and density in comparison with the other two cell types. These results initiate a quantitative profile of mechanobiological phenotypes in TNBC, with future impacts in helping to predict metastatic propensities to organ-specific sites in a clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/732593f5-1ffe-47f3-9b7b-0f3262a14756\/@v03B8ZCj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic potential,Metastasis,Bone metastasis,Brain metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12127"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ariana Joy L.

Adenosine is produced at high levels in the TME as a result of hypoxia-driven tumor cell death. As a result, ATP is released from dying cells generating adenosine via enzymatic dephosphorylation, mainly by ectonucleotidases CD39 &#38; CD73. This results in high extracellular adenosine levels, being elevated 100-500x in the TME. The free adenosine proceeds to binding one of its four known receptors A1, A2a, A2b &#38; A3. The binding of adenosine to A2AR &#38; A2BR contributes to immunosuppression via cyclic AMP pathway. It has been observed that bound A2AR suppress T cell function (CD8+T &#38; NK) while A2BR dampens myeloid cell function and promotes chemotaxis. These concerted actions thereby enhance tumor growth and metastasis. Blocking the binding of adenosine to the A2AR &#38; A2BR results in T-cell activation and infiltration of immune cells in the TME. TT-10 &#38; TT-4 are potent and selective antagonists of A2AR &#38; A2BR. Both agents are being developed for the treatment of advanced cancers individually and as dual inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: Balb\/c mice were implanted with 5 x 10<sup>4<\/sup> 4T1 cells and randomly assigned to 6 groups per study; (1) Vehicle Control-VC, (2) TT-10, 1 mg\/kg, PO, BID (3) TT-4, 3 mg\/kg, PO, BID (4) Anti-mPD-1 , 200 ug, IP (D4, 8, 14) (5) 1 mg\/kg TT-10 + 200 ug Anti-mPD-1 (D4, 8, 14) and (6) TT-4, 3 mg\/kg, PO, BID + 200 ug Anti-mPD-1 (D4, 8, 14). Mice were dosed for 21 days, and tumor volume was measured 2x a week. After 21 days post initiation of treatment (31 days post 4T1 cell inoculation), mice were sacrificed, TIL populations were isolated from 4T1 induced tumors and interrogated via Flow. Markers for surface staining included CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD49, Ly6G.<br \/>Results: All implanted mice developed measurable tumors. Mean suppression of tumor growth was observed to be greater in single agent TT-10 (p&#60;0.05) &#38; TT-4 (p&#60;0.05), over single agent anti-PD-1 inhibitor when compared to the control on day 31, post 4T1 cell inoculation. Analysis of the TIL at the end of the study further supported the observation of tumor growth suppression, from increased T-cell activity seen for both TT-10 &#38; TT-4 when compared to the VC. Furthermore, striking reductions in MDSC populations were also observed in both TT-10 &#38; TT-4 treated mice, when compared to single agent anti-PD-1 and the VC.<br \/>Conclusions: TT-10 &#38; TT-4 alone was superior (p&#60;0.05) to the VC as well as single agent anti-PD-1 in slowing tumor growth, which was further supported by the increase in T-cell activity observed in the end of study TIL analysis. Lastly, striking reductions in MDSC populations were also observed in both TT-10 &#38; TT-4 treated mice, when compared to single agent anti-PD-1 and the VC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0fd6ddda-5273-4cbd-a0a1-8ba711b5d9b8\/@v03B8ZCj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,MDSC,T cell,ATP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12129"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Desa Rae E.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the migratory, invasive, and adhesive abilities of HGSOC cells, representing different stages of disease evolution, in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) organotypic assays. Five HGSOC cell lines, collected at different stages of disease progression were used throughout this study; PEO1, PEO4, and PEO6 cells were obtained from a first patient, whereas PEO14 and PEO23 cells were isolated from a second patient. Both wound healing (WH) and Boyden chamber (BC) assays were performed to study the migratory capacity of each cell line, while invasion was assessed by adding a layer of extracellular matrix to the BC assays. Finally, 2D adhesion assays were performed on fibronectin coated plates. On the other hand, 3D organotypic models composed of a mixture of collagen I and fibroblasts, topped with a monolayer of mesothelial cells, were constructed to further study the metastatic potential of all five HGSOC cell lines; HGSOC were plated on top of the mesothelial cells, and their adhesive behavior and capacity to displace mesothelial cells was followed by fluorescence microscopy. In 2D studies, the migratory and invasive capacities of the HGSOC cells decreased along disease evolution in both cell line series. Moreover, a distinct migration pattern was observed; cell lines representing early-stage disease had a tendency to migrate as individual cells, while cells representing late stage disease migrated in clusters. Also in 2D conditions, adhesion rates were found to be similar between all cell lines. Noteworthy, these results obtained in 2D conditions were somewhat contradicted by the results obtained in the 3D organotypic models, as both late-state disease PEO6 and PEO23 cells adhered more rapidly to the mesothelial cell monolayer than their early-stage counterparts. Furthermore, cell lines previously found to be tumorigenic <i>in vivo<\/i> such as PEO4, PEO6, and PEO14, demonstrated to trigger higher rates of mesothelial cell displacement in the 3D organotypic model system. This mesothelial cell displacement was also observed after exposure of mesothelial cells to conditioned media derived from PEO4, PEO6, or PEO14 cultures. In conclusion, 2D <i>in vitro<\/i> assays demonstrated lower migration and invasion capacities at late- rather than early-stage disease, while the opposite was observed in the organotypic models. Mesothelial cell displacement was found to be associated with tumorigenicity <i>in vivo<\/i> and to be independent of physical interactions between cancer cells and mesothelial cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a37a03d-7d1a-4dc1-97ba-e281a95d7edc\/@v03B8ZCj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic potential,Mesothelium,Ovarian cancer,Organotypic culture model system,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12131"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sabrina J.

Rebastinib, an investigational TIE2 inhibitor inhibits Tie2 receptor in endothelial cells and macrophages. M2-like Tie2+ macrophages, being pro-tumorigenic, are an attractive target for cancer therapy. Current clinical trials are testing rebastinib with chemotherapy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. However, the mechanism is not fully understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of rebastinib alone and combined with chemotherapy in preclinical models of ovarian cancer.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: RNA-Seq was carried out to determine rebastinib-induced gene expression in ID8 cells and PMJ2R murine peritoneal macrophages. To determine the pharmacodynamics of immune cells in ascites, syngeneic ID8 mice were pre-treated with 10 mg\/kg\/day rebastinib\/control for a week, followed by rebastinib with or without 20 mg\/kg carboplatin + 12 mg\/kg paclitaxel (chemo) for two weeks. Mice were sacrificed 24h after the last treatment to harvest ascites for flow cytometry. Cohorts of mice from syngeneic ID8 murine model and from a patient derived xenograft (PDX) model of ovarian cancer were used for survival analysis.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: RNA-Seq showed that in ID8 cells, 1528 genes were upregulated and 3115 genes were downregulated by rebastinib. In macrophages, 2302 genes were upregulated and 2970 genes were downregulated. Several ANGPT-like genes (ANGPTL2, ANGPTL4, ANGPTL6) involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, proliferation were downregulated 2X-10X (p&#60;0.001) in ID8 cells and macrophages. ANGPTL1, an anti-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic gene, was increased 10X in ID8 cells (p&#60;0.001) but not altered in macrophages. ANGPT2, a context-dependent agonist\/antagonist of TIE2 pathway, was increased 1.42X in ID8 (P&#60;0.05) cells and 4.6X in macrophages (p&#60;0.001). Flow studies showed that rebastinib significantly increased CD45+ macrophage (p&#60;0.03 vs. chemo; p&#60;0.02 vs. rebastinib+chemo), maintained Th leukocytes (p&#60;0.03, vs. chemo) and significantly increased cytotoxic T cells (p&#60;0.02 vs. control; p&#60;0.0004, p&#60;0.0001 vs. chemo and rebastinib+chemo, respectively). Rebastinib had no significant effect on regulatory T cells, Tie2+ macrophages or Tie2+ M2 macrophages. Rebastinib combined with chemotherapy improved median survival significantly in murine models of ovarian cancer - ID8 (p&#60;0.01) and PDX (p&#60;0.0001).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Rebastinib exerts differential effects on tumor cells and macrophages that could contribute to its mechanism of action. Rebastinib alters immune cells and increases cytotoxic T cells in ascites. Rebastinib combined with chemotherapy extends survival in PDX and syngeneic ID8 murine models of ovarian cancer. Further investigation using rational combinations of rebastinib and chemotherapy are underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3d8fdb46-0b37-4689-a961-7eb6f3acee79\/@v03B8ZCj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Angiogenesis,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12136"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vijayalaxmi G.

Normally, NME7 is only expressed and secreted by cells of a Day 3 to Day 5 human blastocyst. NME7 expression is then turned off and expression of self-regulating, adult forms of NME proteins is turned on. However, we found that NME7 expression is mistakenly turned on again in cancer cells. Cleavage of NME7 to NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> enables secretion from the cell, where it then binds to and dimerizes the MUC1* extracellular domain, which activates the MAP kinase signaling cascade.<br \/>Methods: Because NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> shares homology to other adult forms of NME proteins, which are required for normal cellular function, we needed to develop a monoclonal antibody that binds to NME7<sub>AB<\/sub>, but not to other NME proteins, and disrupts its interaction with the MUC1* growth factor receptor as well. To investigate the effects of NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> on cancer growth and metastasis, we generated populations of cancer cells that had been cultured in a serum-free media to which was added a recombinant NME7<sub>AB<\/sub>. The parent cells, the NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> grown progeny, or mixed populations were implanted into NSG mice to test the effect of novel anti-NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> antibodies on tumor growth and metastasis. Parent tumor cells and the NME7<sub>AB<\/sub>-grown cells were engineered to emit light at different wavelengths so that growth of each population could be separately tracked in live animals.<br \/>Results: Cancer cells that were cultured in a serum-free media containing recombinant NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> for 10 days acquired characteristics of more metastatic cells, often called cancer stem cells (referred to here as NME7<sub>AB<\/sub>-CSCs). They upregulated metastatic markers by up to 100-fold, became non-adherent, entered dormancy and formed tumors from injection of as few as 10,000 cells. The addition of an anti-NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> antibody during the 10-day culture period blocked this transition. NME7<sub>AB<\/sub>-CSCs that were injected into the tail vein of NSG mice induced widespread metastasis in 6-10 days, after which an anti-NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> antibody was i.v. administered. The anti-NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> antibody greatly reduced or cleared the metastasis. Animals implanted sub-cutaneously with NME7<sub>AB<\/sub>-CSCs, then administered anti-NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> antibody, showed a significant reduction in the spread of breast cancer cells to the liver. Mixed populations of parent cells plus NME7<sub>AB<\/sub>-CSCs, which emitted light at different wavelengths, were implanted sub-cutaneously and allowed to become established. The percent of the implanted tumor that was NME7<sub>AB<\/sub>-CSCs determined the growth rate of the entire tumor. An anti-NME7<sub>AB<\/sub> antibody inhibited growth of the parent cells as well as the NME7<sub>AB<\/sub>-CSCs.<br \/>Conclusion: These data support further pre-clinical development to allow for a clinical candidate to be tested in a metastatic as well as an adjuvant setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/33aa87c6-a7de-4e6a-87cd-d82ba081f63c\/@v03B8ZCj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic potential,Antibody,Therapeutic target,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12138"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cynthia Carol Bamdad<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benoit J.

In glioblastoma (GBM), interactions with HA mediate tumor cell invasion. An improved knowledge of the biological underpinnings of HA-dependent GBM cell migration can facilitate the development of efficacious therapeutics. To better study how HA in the tumor matrix affects invasion, we have developed a tunable, 3D culture system in which to study gliomaspheres (GSs) of patient-derived tumor cells. Photopolymerization (365 nm for 15 seconds) of GSs suspended in a solution 0.025 w\/v% lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP), thiolated 4-arm poly-ethylene glycol (20 kDa, Laysan Bio), 8-arm poly-ethylene glycol-norbornene (20 kDa, Laysan Bio), thiolated peptides containing an &#8216;RGD&#8217; amino acid motif, and either 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 w\/v% of thiolated HA (700 kDa average molecular weight, Lifecore Biomedical) yielded 3D hydrogels of varying HA concentrations and similar mechanical properties. Relative invasive capacity, quantified by shape factor (deviation from circularity) and migration length (maximum extension length of processes from the GS periphery), differed across patient lines and was independent of their Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) classification as either mesenchymal or proneural. Hydrogels with higher amounts of HA (&#62;0.25% w\/v) generally enhanced invasion as compared to low HA (0.10 w\/v%) hydrogels. In certain cell lines, a biphasic relationship between HA concentration and migration was observed, in line with previous reports of CD44 expression and migration. Moreover, inhibition of the CD44-Ezrin-Actin axis, using NSC668394, reduced migratory activity in hydrogels with higher HA (&#62;0.25% w\/v), while slightly increasing invasion in hydrogels with low HA (0.10 w\/v%). In sum, results demonstrate the use of a matrix-mimetic, 3D hydrogel system in which to study GBM invasion through the local extracellular matrix.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ba4bf0f9-151f-4db3-97d7-1019282fce91\/@v03B8ZCj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Hyaluronan,Invasion,CD44,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12139"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gevick Safarians<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Itay Solomon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alireza Sohrabi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Seidlits<\/i><\/presenter>.

This analysis highlights a paradox of gastrointestinal carcinomas metastasis into portal vein: colorectal, pancreatic, small bowel and gastric carcinomas invariably release cancer cells to portal vein, which is the primary dissemination route, but very rarely form intraportal metastasis. On the contrary, hepatocellular carcinoma rarely releases cancer cells into portal vein, but very often forms intraportal metastasis. This disproportional frequency of HCC portal metastasis cannot be rationalized by hepatofugal (reverse) portal blood flow due to accompanying liver cirrhosis because: 1) reverse portal flow occurs in about 10% of cirrhotic patients, while portal metastasis occurs in 40-100% of HCC cases, and 2) portal vein prevalence of HCC metastasis is also the characteristic of non-cirrhotic patients. The &#8216;portal paradox&#8217; becomes a logical event in light of comparative morphology and phylogeny of the chordate lineage: the formation of the unique portal venous system preceded the appearance of liver in evolution of chordates. The analysis suggests that the appearance of the portal venous system, draining blood from caudal intestine and supplying hormones and growth factors of pancreatic family (HGFPF) to midgut diverticulum in the early evolution of ancestral chordates, promoted differentiation of the diverticulum&#8217;s enterocytes into the hepatocyte phenotype and further formation of the liver in evolution of vertebrates. These promotional-dependent interactions are conserved in the vertebrate lineage but attributed to hepatocyte-derived cells only; the rest of gastrointestinal endodermal derivatives occurred independently from portal system in chordate phylogeny. Therefore, non-HCC gastrointestinal carcinomas&#8217; cells do not have this affinity to and dependence on portal blood and portal blood does not promote attachment and growth of non-HCC gastrointestinal carcinomas&#8217; cells in the portal conduit. I hypothesize that selective homing and proliferation of HCC cells in the portal vein environment are due to a uniquely high concentration of HGFPF in portal blood: portal vein formed by merging superior mesenteric and pancreatic veins. HGFPF are also necessary for liver function and renewal and are extracted by hepatocytes from passing blood, creating a concentration gradient of HGFPF between the portal blood and hepatic vein outflow, making post-liver organs less favorable spaces for HCC metastasis. This also suggests that the portal vein environment (i.e., high concentration of HGFPF) promotes the differentiation and selection of more aggressive HCC clones from already-seeded portal HCC cells, explaining the worse outcome of HCC patients with portal metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9a87cb80-703d-45c9-b363-9b8d2293bde6\/@v03B8ZCj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Metastasis,Growth factor,Pancreas,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12140"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vladimir M.

Breast cancer brain metastasis is often fatal and occurs in 15-20% of patients diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer. Traditional chemotherapy delivery to the brain is limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-tumor barrier (BTB). Low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is a unique technique recently investigated to non-invasively disrupt these barriers and aid neuro-modulation. Herein, we demonstrate the use of a clinical LIFU device to modulate blood-tumor permeability and deliver combined chemotherapy in a novel preclinical model of brain metastases of breast cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Brain colonizing MDA-MB-231Br cells transfected with luciferase were injected into athymic Nu\/Nu female mice by intracardiac injection into the left ventricle (per mouse 175,000 cells). Brain metastasis was allowed to develop, and tumor burden was monitored by bioluminescent imaging IVIS Spectrum CT (Perkin Elmer). Mice were randomized into sham or single treatment or combined treatment groups on Day 21 (Doxil nanoparticles 5.6 mg\/kg or Paclitaxel 10mg\/kg). Mice receiving LIFU were placed on a specially designed animal restraint with the skull partially immersed in degassed water. T1 weighted MRI was used to identify and localize sonication spots within the cortex, and mice were sonicated using 0.4uL\/kg Definity&#169; at 0.3 cavitation dose for 60sec. Treatment with LIFU was continued once weekly for three consecutive weeks. Survival and tumor burden was recorded until mice developed neurological symptoms. LIFU induced blood-brain barrier breakdown in healthy mice was also analyzed by in-situ brain perfusion with <sup>14C<\/sup>Sucrose, <sup>3H<\/sup>Glucose, and <sup>3H<\/sup>Ivermectin to monitor BBB integrity and transporter function.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Mice receiving LIFU+paclitaxel+Doxil-NP showed significantly lower tumor burden (peak area 635.9) and higher median survival of 60 days as compared to vehicle (29d) and LIFU+vehicle (32d) groups. Analysis of BBB permeability in healthy mice demonstrated significantly higher passive permeability marker accumulation than non-sonicated contralateral hemisphere.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Timing the combined chemotherapy with LIFU induced windows of maximal BBB opening resulted in slower tumor progression and increased survival in a preclinical model of breast cancer brain metastasis.

Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer constitutes roughly 70% of all breast cancers. Early-stage ER+ breast cancers usually respond well to ER-targeted therapies. However, only 20-40% of patients with advanced ER+ breast cancer respond to ER-targeted therapy. Recently, three inhibitors for the cyclin-dependent kinase 4\/6 (CDK4\/6) were approved as first-line and\/or second-line treatment in combination with ER-targeted therapies. Unfortunately, despite initial response to the combination treatment, patients acquire resistance to both ER-targeted therapies and CDK4\/6 inhibitors over time. As a result of this, the 5-year survival of women with metastatic breast cancer is 28%. A large contribution to this poor survival rate is the desmoplastic nature of the tumor microenvironment. Desmoplasia is characterized by the abnormal growth of fibroblasts and a dense extracellular matrix. The role of desmoplasia in breast cancer and its contribution to promoting a pro-tumor environment by limiting nutrients and oxygen has been extensively studied. However, the role of secreted factors such as cytokines and metabolites by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) has been poorly studied in the context of targeted drug resistance and its effects on tumor behavior. Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of stroma-mediated resistance to targeted therapies, we have propagated patient-derived organoids and CAFs from treatment-na&#239;ve and treatment-resistant ER+ breast tumors. Our data shows that conditioned media from CAFs have variable ability to drive resistance to hormone therapy and CDK4\/6 inhibitors. To identify secreted factors that drive resistance, we have performed cytokine arrays and untargeted metabolomics of the CAF lines that were the strongest drivers of resistance. We have identified several cytokines, such as IL-5, IL-8 and YKL40, that were secreted by all CAF lines. Furthermore, many CAF lines secreted the TCA cycle intermediates &#945;-ketoglutarate and succinate, which have been implicated as oncometabolites in solid tumors. Our preliminary data suggests that YKL40, and succinate induce drug resistance. Together, this suggests that these factors secreted by CAFs play a role in supporting a pro-tumor environment by promoting drug resistance. Defining this mechanism of resistance to ER-targeted therapy and CDK4\/6 inhibitors will elucidate potential therapeutic targets to enhance patient response to therapy.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/da4bc02d-2795-400e-a71e-63dc296ab135\/@w03B8ZCk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Drug resistance,Organoids,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12143"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>JENNY HOGSTROM<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kayla Cruz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaymin Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tejas Mehta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelica Warren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taru Muranen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Early metastatic dissemination, rich desmoplastic stroma and immunosuppressive infiltrate are some of the features contributing to the poor prognosis of PDAC patients (5-year survival rate of less than 10%). Despite scientific progress in the development of new therapeutic regimes, PDAC patients in low- and middle-income countries have restricted access to high-cost innovative drugs. Recently, attention has been given to the concept of drug repurposing that could meet the need for novel but affordable and widely accessible therapies. Imidazoline receptor 1 Nischarin (NISCH, IR1, IRAS) is an integrin &#945;5-interacting protein that acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer through modulation of cancer cell motility and survival. Importantly, NISCH has several clinically approved agonists that are used for the treatment of hypertension and are shown to modulate autophagy and reduce inflammation and fibrosis, which makes NISCH a potentially good therapeutic target for defying PDAC progression. Based on our GSEA analysis of NISCH expression in PDAC patient samples, NISCH was predicted to have an effect on cancer cell focal adhesion assembly and cytoskeletal organization. Therefore, we examined the effects of NISCH agonists on PDAC cells fitness <i>in vitro<\/i>. A panel of PDAC cell lines was tested in MTT assay to determine the effects of NISCH agonists rilmenidine, clonidine and moxonidine on cell viability. Flow cytometry, western blot and immunofluorescence were used to examine the effects of NISCH agonists on PDAC cell metabolism, migration and cytoskeletal organization. Tg(<i>fli1<\/i>:EGFP) zebrafish model was used to examine the effects of NISCH agonists on PDAC cell growth and invasion. We found that NISCH was expressed in PDAC cell lines, and that out of the three tested agonists, rilmenidine most potently inhibited cancer cell viability. Treatment with rilmenidine significantly reduced PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cell attachment to extracellular matrix (collagen type I and fibronectin) and migratory potential in wound healing and transwell assays. Furthermore, treatment with rilmenidine altered the organization of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion assembly, potentially through the reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Importantly, treatment with rilmenidine inhibited invasion of PANC-1 cells in Tg(<i>fli1<\/i>:EGFP) zebrafish model. With these antimigratory and potentially antimetastatic effects of rilmenidine, our study lays the ground for a more extensive examination of the biological role of NISCH in PDAC progression and implies that its agonists may be good candidates for drug repurposing in this type of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a9756da9-5b83-43bc-b583-c5fa9aa8713f\/@w03B8ZCk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Adhesion,Migration,Actin cytoskeleton,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12144"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marijana Pavlovic<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marija Ostojic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristina Zivic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandar Pavic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatjana Srdic-Rajic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jelena Grahovac<\/i><\/presenter>.

The Perimeter B-Series OCT System combines wide field-OCT (WF-OCT) with an artificial intelligence system, ImgAssist, to assist clinicians in the detection of lesions suspicious for breast cancer. The objective of this investigational device trial is to assess adjunctive Perimeter B-Series OCT System use compared to standard care in identifying and addressing positive margins intraoperatively.<br \/>Design: Prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-arm trial in females with biopsy-confirmed cancer undergoing breast conservation surgery (BCS) (NCT05113927). Following lumpectomy and standard-of-care intraoperative margin assessment participants will be randomized to a device or control arm (2:1 schema). Controls may undergo intraoperative pathology or frozen section analysis, per routine. WF-OCT will be done on all device arm specimens, with an opportunity to excise tissue from the lumpectomy cavity post-analysis. The new margin will be imaged with WF-OCT and the surgeon may take up to a maximum of 6 total shaves, including up to 2 shaves in each orientation.<br \/>Eligibility: Adult females undergoing breast conservation surgery for biopsy-confirmed Stage 0-III invasive ductal and\/or DCIS are eligible, including post-neoadjuvant therapy. Pregnant or lactating, those with Stage IV cancer, lobular carcinoma as primary diagnosis, previous ipsilateral breast surgery, multi-centric or bilateral disease, use of cryolocalization, or any treatment affecting margin integrity will be excluded.<br \/>Specific Aim: The study hypothesis is that use of the Perimeter B-Series OCT System in BCS will reduce the proportion of subjects with at least 1 unaddressed positive margin. The primary endpoint is occurrence of at least 1 unaddressed positive margin for a subject. The secondary endpoint is the number of unaddressed positive margins per subject. Safety includes Adverse Events; false-positive shaves per subject (device arm); and BREAST-Q Satisfaction with Breasts subscale. Other outcomes are total excised tissue volume, initial and all procedures including<br \/>repeat surgeries; margin-level effectiveness (sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV); and operative time.<br \/>Statistical Methods: The study was powered via the primary endpoint, assuming a 15% unaddressed margin rate, 90% power, 2:1 device-to-control ratio, and 10% loss of subjects due to screen or device failure. Both the primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints are based on within-subject comparison of the 2 treatments in the device arm (SOC+WF-OCT).<br \/>Planned Accrual: 309 subjects (206 device, 103 control) will be enrolled at 8 centers over approximately 12 months.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-06 Imaging of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Breast,Imaging,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12145"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Rempel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Berkeley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Moos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison A.

Newly diagnosed GBM (ndGBM) is treated with adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ), however, more than 50% of patients do not respond to therapy. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy concomitant with maintenance TMZ was approved by the FDA in 2015 and represents a major advance in treatment of patients with ndGBM. Recently, lomustine (CCNU) together with TMZ demonstrated improved overall and progression-free survival following resection and radiochemotherapy in patients with ndGBM. Accordingly, the current study aimed to examine the effect of concomitant application of TTFields with TMZ and CCNU in GBM cells.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> GBM cells (U-87 MG and LN229) were treated for 72 h with TTFields at a frequency of 200 kHz and an intensity of 1 V\/cm RMS using the inovitro system. Efficacy of combining TTFields with TMZ and\/or CCNU was tested by measuring cell survival, clonogenic potential, overall effect (multiplicity product of cytotoxicity and clonogenicity), and apoptosis induction.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Combination of TMZ and TTFields resulted in increased cytotoxicity compared with each treatment alone. The cytotoxic effect resulting from co-application of CCNU with TTFields suggested a synergistic interaction between the two modalities. The clonogenic, overall, and apoptotic effects of TMZ and CCNU were also enhanced following co-treatment with TTFields. The triple combination of TTFields with both TMZ and CCNU was more efficacious than TMZ\/CCNU or TTFields separately.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The current research suggests potential benefits for the treatment of GBM using concomitant application of TTFields with TMZ\/CCNU.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c51fea88-2d90-4d0c-91ae-34f4887a3666\/@w03B8ZCk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Glioblastoma,Temozolomide,Alkylating agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18151"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hila Fishman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roni Monin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Eyal Dor-On<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adi Haber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moshe Giladi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uri Weinberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoram Palti<\/i><\/presenter>.
