ITH also affects anti-tumor immunity, with immune cell infiltration, neo-antigen expression and T cell receptor (TCR) profiles differing between separate regions of an individual tumor. However, the extent to which separate tumor subclones differ in their capacity for immune evasion, the tumor-intrinsic mechanisms underlying any such heterogeneity, and its impact on cancer immunosurveillance remain largely unexplored. We have previously developed personalized models of anti-tumor immunity, based on co-cultures of cancer organoids and autologous T-cells. These co-culture systems can be used to evaluate the efficacy of cancer immunosurveillance at the level of an individual patient.<br \/><b>Approach: <\/b>Here, we leverage the multi-region TRACERx lung cancer evolution study to generate a patient-derived study platform that allows the evaluation of T-cell responses to individual cancer subclones. We generated libraries of &#62;20 separate non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) organoid lines, based on isolating individual (clonal) organoids established from multiple spatially separated tumor regions. Each organoid subline was co-cultured with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) to evaluate how they differ in their capacity to elicit a T-cell response.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Our data reveal heterogeneity between individual clonal organoid sublines in their capacity to stimulate TIL. The proportion of TIL being activated by a particular subclone, as measured by 4-1BB (CD137) expression, ranged from 5 to 42%. These differences could not be explained by differences in MHC class I or PD-L1 expression. We are currently using DNA, RNA and TCR sequencing to characterize &#8216;immune evading&#8217; and &#8216;non-immune evading&#8217; sublines. Data will be updated on emerging subclonal immune evasion mechanisms inferred through DNA\/RNA\/TCR sequencing.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Individual cancer subclones show differences in the degree of immune evasion. This patient-derived study platform allows moving beyond descriptive analyses of the heterogeneity of anti-tumor immunity, allowing fine-grained functional studies of how ITH affects cancer immunosurveillance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Immuno-oncology,T cell,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Krijn K.

We defined mucin-1 (MUC1) as a potential target in HGSOC biopsies and the HGSOC cell lines, OvCAR3 and G164. We then generated CAR-T cells against MUC1 and tested them in spheroid and collagen gel cultures. In spheroids, although CAR-T cells killed OvCAR3 cells, G164 cells failed to induce CAR-T cell activation or cytotoxicity. However, when we added primary omental fibroblasts from ovarian cancer patients to G164 spheroids, CAR-T cells were activated and cytotoxic. Fibroblast conditioned medium also activated CAR-T cells to kill G164 cells in spheroids and this was due to their production of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). Further experiments revealed that CCL2 produced by fibroblast stimulated CCR2\/4 positive CAR-T cells to a higher state of activation, which enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells against G164 cells. We then investigated CAR-T cell activity in co-cultures of OvCAR3 or G164 cells and primary fibroblasts embedded in collagen. CAR-T cells migrated into OvCAR3 gels and killed the malignant cells during a three-day period. However, CAR-T cells failed to migrate into gels with G164 cells and there was no malignant cell killing. Gels containing G164 cells had denser extracellular matrix (ECM) than OvCAR3 gels, as measured by staining for collagens and fibronectin. Previously, we showed that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF&#946;) secreted by HGSOC cells acted on fibroblasts to induce the production of ECM in collagen gels.<sup>1<\/sup> Treating G164 gels with the TGF&#946; receptor inhibitor SB431542 reduced ECM density, stimulated CAR-T cell migration and restored CAR-T cell cytotoxicity against G164 cells. Using these different human 3D models we have demonstrated that malignant cell intrinsic factors can cause resistance to CAR-T cells. Sensitivity to CAR-T cell killing can be modulated both positively and negatively by fibroblasts. Targeting ECM along with CAR-T cell therapy might improve the efficiency of CAR-T cells in solid tumors.<br \/><sup>1<\/sup>Delaine-Smith et al, iScience, 2021","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,3D models,Extracellular matrix,Transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF-&#946;),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joash Dominic Joy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatrice Malacrida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Laforêts<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Panoraia Kotantaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eleni Maniati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Hopkins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ianire Calleja<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Brett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takis Athanasopoulos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadfer Ali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Emery-Billcliff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ida Ricciardelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlotte Kay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayne Colebrook<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Magda Ali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Strong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frances Balkwill<\/i><\/presenter>.

Currently, the dominant platform for precision medicine utilizes genomics\/sequencing-based assays to measure the expression and\/or mutational profiles and then infer patient responses to therapies based on previous knowledge; however, this approach benefits less than 10-15% of patients with profiled tumors. Recognizing the inherent limitations of these inference-based methods, functional assays (e.g., organoids and PDX models) have been developed; however, these approaches also have significant limitations including high cost and time required to establish the models, low &#8220;take rates&#8221;, and destruction of the native tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome these challenges, EMPIRI uses a novel 3D <i>ex vivo<\/i> tumor slice culture method (E-slices) that enables rapid, personalized drug sensitivity testing in intact patient tumor tissues. Major differentiators of the E-slice platform from other ex vivo methods include the use of chemically defined, serum-free medium, longitudinal viability measurements from the same tissue, tracking of dynamic responses to treatment over 2-3 weeks, and retention of the native TME and tissue architecture, unlike other approaches. In addition, E-slices can be generated from any solid tumor tested thus far (breast, lung, colorectal, pancreas, brain, head 7 neck, and others) from patient tumors directly and PDX and genetically engineered mouse models. In addition, because E-slices retain tumor-infiltrating immune cells in their native microenvironment and spatial topography of all cell types in the endogenous configuration, it sustains immune cell survival and proliferation and measures immunotherapy responses ex vivo. The E-slice method is compatible with biopsies as well as surgical samples. Importantly, it has been shown to accurately predict individual patient treatment responses to chemotherapies and targeted therapies in 4-12 days, paving the way for evidence-based personalized treatment selections in a clinically actionable time frame. In summary, we present a novel ex vivo 3D human tumor tissue drug sensitivity platform that faithfully replicates the patient tumor tissues and provides personalized treatment responses in a clinically actionable time frame.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Personalized medicine,Precision medicine,Diagnosis,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Archana Gopalan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas D.

We hypothesize that the development of an in vivo patient-derived organoid (PDO) model will improve our understanding of the underlying genomic and transcriptomic alterations that help drive the biology of metastases for specific lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) histologic subtypes.<br \/>Methods: Fresh LUAD specimens were processed and cultured using optimized organoid culture conditions. Established PDOs were characterized by histologic analyses, RNA-sequencing and whole genomic sequencing (WGS). Response to therapy of PDOs was evaluated by treatment with combined chemotherapies, targeted therapies, or co-culturing with patient-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) in vitro and\/or in vivo. The metastatic capabilities of PDOs were assessed in vivo using intracardiac injection and scoring for tumor outgrowth in distant organs using in vivo bioluminescence imaging system. Metastatic tumors from specific organs were isolated, PDOs reestablished, and those tumors underwent additional genomic and transcriptomic characterization. Phylogenetic analyses of tumor metastatic progression and putative metastasis markers were investigated by WGS and RNA-sequencing.<br \/>Results: We successfully generated 14 PDOs from early-stage (I-II) primary LUAD specimens and 12 from human LUAD metastatic sites (brain, bone and pleural effusion). All PDOs recapitulate genetic alterations and transcriptomic signatures of their original tumors. Moreover, we found that individual PDOs exhibit distinct responses to different chemotherapy regimens and targeted therapies. Pre-treatment of PDOs with low doses of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimens activated patient-matched tumor specific T cells and enhanced PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor Nivolumab induced CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-mediated tumor killing. Importantly, utilizing our in vivo PDO metastasis model we successfully developed a platform to evaluate: 1) metastatic potential, 2) response to targeted therapies, 3) tumor evolution with respect of genomic instability, tumor phylogeny, and colonization, and 4) molecular signatures promoting tumor metastases.<br \/>Conclusion: Our PDO system reliably models human LUAD <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo, <\/i>by recapitulating histologic architectures, genomic alterations and transcriptomic signatures of the parent LUAD. Using LUAD PDOs we have successfully created multiple platforms to assess response to chemo- and targeted- therapies, develop an in vivo PDO metastasis model to assess tumor evolution, and use of patient matched PMBCs and PDOs to assess immune-priming strategies for individual patient tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Metastasis,Drug response,Tumor metastasis evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuan Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Jones<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite its prevalence, there are still no effective treatments for bone metastasis, leading to very poor survival rates and the mechanism by which certain cancer cells preferentially spread to the bones remains poorly understood. Thus, there is a critical need to develop in vitro experimental models that can mimic key aspects of bone metastasis development to elucidate driving mechanisms of this disease and expedite the discovery of novel drug candidates. To address this unmet need, here we report a spatially patterned, 3D in vitro model which mimics cancer metastasis to bone by incorporating interactions with multiple tissue types. The model is composed of an outer ring of tissue engineered bone derived from 3D osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), and a center containing cancer cells. This interface between these two tissues mimics the way cancer cells invade into the bones through the bone marrow\/bone interface and allows us to track the invasion of fluorescently labeled cancer cells into bone using confocal imaging. Cancer cells and hMSCs were also labeled with orthogonal luciferases (FireflyLuc and NanoLuc), allowing for simultaneous quantification of cancer cell proliferation and osteoblast survival using BLI. We tested the ability of this model to recapitulate known characteristics of in vivo bone metastases including tissue-specific invasion, cancer aggressiveness, cancer-induced bone resorption, and in vivo drug response. Using multiple established breast cancer (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and prostate cancer (LNCaP and PC-3) cell lines, we demonstrate that such spatially patterned coculture models mimic the preferential invasion of cancer cells to bone, but not cartilage or muscle (negative controls) and the rate of invasion in this 3D model correlated with the level of cancer cell aggressiveness. To mimic the effect of cancer invasion on bone remodeling, we established a triculture model in which osteoclasts were seeded over the tissue engineered bone. Micro-computed tomography imaging validated that this model could recapitulate cancer-induced bone resorption, and the degree of bone resorption also correlated with cancer cell aggressiveness. Using parathyroid hormone as a model drug, we demonstrate this 3D model recapitulates drug responses consistent with what has been observed using in vivo mouse models. Such spatially patterned 3D models can provide a scalable platform for drug screening with substantially reduced time and cost compared to animal models. Furthermore, integrating these 3D cancer metastasis models with high-dimensional methods, such as single-cell RNAseq could expedite the discovery of novel druggable drivers of bone metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,3D models,Breast cancer,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eva C.

Despite successes in multiple common cancers, such prediction remains challenging for the majority of rare and understudied tumors, given the absence of laboratory model systems in which to discover and\/or validate therapeutic hypotheses. Crucially, we lack a comprehensive knowledge of <i>ex vivo<\/i> growth requirements given the tumor&#8217;s molecular and cellular makeup. To address this challenge, we developed a low-input multiplexed sequencing protocol allowing the systematic tracking of changes to tumor cell fraction across hundreds of growth conditions. We coupled this approach with a patient-partnered pipeline for fresh sample sourcing to tackle the challenge of model generation in rare diseases including desmoid tumors, a rare soft-tissue tumor driven by activating beta-catenin mutations. We show that non-malignant cell outgrowth contributes to the failure of long-term model generation in over 70% of cases when a traditional single-media approach is used. By utilizing our systematic media screening strategy, we were able to identify several conditions that preserved the tumor component over at least 3 passages, in triplicate. Notably, there was a sample-to-sample variability in which media conditions preserved tumor composition, supporting our hypothesis that empirical screening of media conditions increases model generation success rate. We also aim to understand the relationship between tumor cell preservation in culture and their molecular makeup. However, while classic tissue markers or copy-number variation can be used to identify the tumor and\/or stromal components in common epithelial cancers, no such reference exists for rare sarcomas with relatively quiet genomes. To create a reference of transcriptional patterns for these diseases, we are adapting Seq-Well, a low-cost single-cell RNA sequencing platform, to annotate gene expression with allelic information. In a proof-of-concept, we sequenced 552 cells from an admixed sample and we successfully resolved the genotype of 331 (60%) cells. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between genotypes using the single cell data showed agreement with DEGs identified via bulk sequencing methods, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. Looking ahead, we aim to predict <i>ex vivo<\/i> growth requirements for rare sarcomas based on technical, clinical, and genomic properties of the starting tumor material. We also aim to utilize our strategy to identify genetic or drug perturbations that specifically give the tumor cells a growth disadvantage, enabling the validation of putative targets in early patient samples. Moreover, we are making all expandable, long-term cell lines generated from our strategy publicly available to the scientific community.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Sequencing,&#946;-catenin,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kathryn Cebula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mushriq Al-Jazrawe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Lernman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Van Hare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Rios<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moony Tseng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Boehm<\/i><\/presenter>.

While overall incidence and mortality rates have dropped in recent decades, GC remains a significant cause of health disparities for all major US racial and ethnic minority groups (Black\/African Americans, Hispanic\/Latino Americans, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaskan Natives), who are all at least twice as likely to be diagnosed with and die from GC compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Despite such high minority cancer burden, few FDA-approved targeted therapies are available for GC. This can be partially explained by limited availability of cancer genome data and patient-derived models from racial\/ethnic minority populations, hampering gene target identification and drug efficacy studies. Our group has spearheaded the development of the University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft Development and Trial Center (UCaMP) with the goal of addressing these critical issues for GC patient care. Thus far, we have characterized over 30 GC samples from racial\/ethnic minorities (mGC), establishing patient-derived organoid lines (mPDOs) for more than half. Genomic analyses have revealed a significantly lower prevalence of chromosomal instability and higher prevalence of genomically stable GC tumors compared to TCGA, which consists predominantly of NHW patients. Our analyses have also identified high prevalence of alterations within the cell cycle regulation\/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR (PI3K) pathways, both of which are therapeutically targetable by inhibitors already FDA-approved for other cancer types. At the individual gene level, these mGC patients demonstrate distinct patterns of somatic mutations, with fewer <i>PIK3CA <\/i>activating mutations, which is the most commonly mutated gene in the PI3K pathway among TCGA, and <i>TP53 <\/i>deleterious mutations while demonstrating significantly more deleterious mutations in the <i>PTEN<\/i> tumor suppressor gene. Indeed, when we treat our mPDOs with PI3K and CDK inhibitors, we observe significant responses <i>in vitro<\/i>. We are now generating genome-edited mPDO lines from normal gastric tissue to model specific alterations observed in our mGC cohort for functional characterization within GC pathogenesis and drug response validation. Our findings highlight an important molecular distinction of GC development in racial\/ethnic US minorities, providing a rationale for alternative treatments to address GC health disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Drug sensitivity,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicole B.
