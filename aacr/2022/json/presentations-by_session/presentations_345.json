[{"Abstract":"Dysregulated alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is commonly associated with human malignancies, producing pathological proteomes that underlie disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. The CDC2-like kinases (CLKs) and dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinases (DYRKs) are thought to govern AS efficiency and specificity by directly phosphorylating splicing factors that influence pre-mRNA splice junction selection. Cirtuvivint (SM08502) is a first-in-class small molecule ATP-competitive inhibitor of CLK\/DYRK kinases. To evaluate the contribution of these kinases to AS profiles, high-depth RNAseq analysis was performed across 39 tumor cell lines (representing 9 lineages) and compared to 6 non-cancerous cell lines after treatment with cirtuvivint. Both baseline and drug-induced changes in AS events (ASEs) were measured using a multivariate analysis of transcript splicing (rMATS). Pan-CLK\/DYRK inhibition was found to affect a minority of baseline ASEs, leaving the majority of spliceosome activity intact in all samples; however, the magnitude and quantity of detected drug-induced alterations were larger in tumor compared to non-cancerous cell lines. The majority of ASEs resulting from pan-CLK\/DYRK inhibition were enriched for exon skipping events and were tumor type-specific. Moreover, drug-induced ASEs were significantly associated with disease-promoting biology across lineage and oncogenic driver contexts, including perturbed splicing of the AR-V7 variant in treatment-resistant prostate cancer and MDM2 in p53 wild-type cancers.To assess the breadth and depth of CLK\/DYRK dependencies in human cancers, the effects of pan-CLK\/DYRK inhibition on growth and survival of 154 cancer cell line models, 46 PDX models, and 43 CDX models were tested. EC<sub>50<\/sub>s in cell viability assays ranged from 0.014 to 0.73 &#956;M in culture with strong effects observed in subsets of cell lines across all lineages tested. Multiomic data integration revealed sensitivity to cirtuvivint was associated with alterations in splicing genes. In vivo, tumor growth inhibition studies testing cirtuvivint at exposures ~2X below the MTD resulted in significant disease control (&#8805;50% TGI) in 38\/46 PDX and 38\/43 CDX models. These observations indicate broad cancer relevance, at least in the preclinical setting, and expose vulnerabilities to CLK-DYRK-regulated splicing that can potentially be therapeutically addressed with pan CLK\/DYRK inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/27c2a12e-66be-4d41-bc96-2ae9d43daf5c\/@t03B8ZDw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Splice variants,Spliceosome,Cancer therapy,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15088"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth A.

However, despite being amongst the most frequently mutated, translocated and overexpressed oncogenes, no therapy targeting the Myc family members directly has been developed to date. To sustain uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor growth, Myc-driven cancers are known to be addicted to protein translation. This addiction creates a dependency on critical components of the translational machinery providing in turn a unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention. We hypothesized that targeting the translational termination factor GSPT1, a key regulator of protein synthesis, would constitute a vulnerability for Myc-driven tumors. GSPT1 contains a well-defined degron allowing for the recruitment of the E3 ligase cereblon (CRBN) and subsequent proteasomal degradation in the presence of molecular glue degraders. Herein we describe a novel orally bioavailable GSPT1-directed small molecule degrader MRT-2359, which has been rationally designed and optimized to selectively induce apoptosis in translationally addicted cells. MRT-2359 promotes complex formation between CRBN and GSPT1 and potently induces GSPT1 degradation in a CRBN- and degron-dependent manner. The high selectivity of MRT-2359 was subsequently demonstrated by the lack of activity in cells expressing a non-degradable GSPT1 mutant. Although MRT-2359 degrades GSPT1 in all the cell lines tested, profiling in a large panel of cancer lines revealed profound and preferential antiproliferative activity in Myc-driven cell lines, such as high N-Myc expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines and high L-Myc expressing small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines. In the Myc-driven cells, degradation of GSPT1 led to translational repression as manifested by a global shift from polysomes to monosomes resulting in the reduction of a subset of proteins as assessed by quantitative proteomics. In particular, N- or L-Myc protein levels decreased and as a consequence the known Myc target genes were downregulated at the mRNA level. Despite the robust degradation of GSPT1, no marked effect was observed in low N-Myc lines, confirming the selective activity of our GSPT1 degrader in Myc-driven lung cancers. Finally, oral administration of MRT-2359 in high N-Myc NSCLC xenografts and PDXs led to complete intratumoral GSPT1 degradation and concomitant decrease in N-Myc protein levels, resulting in tumor regression. In contrast, MRT-2359 had limited or no activity in low N-Myc NSCLC models, further corroborating the selective vulnerability of Myc-driven tumors to GSPT1 degradation. Together these data support the therapeutic potential of GSPT1-directed MGDs in Myc-driven solid tumors addicted to the protein translation machinery and warrant rapid evaluation towards the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c68ebdea-cb4a-4336-a522-99887b73bdb1\/@t03B8ZDw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Lung cancer,Proteasome-mediated degradation,MYCN,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15089"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gerald Gavory<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahmoud Ghandi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Cecile D’Alessandro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Debora Bonenfant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agustin Chicas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederic Delobel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brad Demarco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Flohr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher King<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Laure Laine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vittoria Massafra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajiv Narayan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arnaud Osmont<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgio Ottaviani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dave Peck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Pessa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nooreen Rubin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Ryckmans<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Schillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ambika Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Tortoioli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominico Vigil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vladislav Zarayskiy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Castle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filip Janku<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Owen Wallace<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Buonamici<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernhard Fasching<\/i><\/presenter>.

CDK7 plays a dual role in tumor progression by regulating the cell cycle via phosphorylation of members of the CDK family and stimulation of transcription via phosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II. CDK7 has also been shown to be associated with super-enhancers which can lead to overexpression of oncogenic driver genes such as BCL2, GFI1, and MYC. The development of a selective inhibitor of CDK7 is a promising strategy to control expression of these oncogenic genes in patients&#8217; tumors. Previously, we described the design and synthesis of a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of CDK7, TGN-1062, which was designed to bind to the catalytic ATP pocket. We showed efficacy in both AML and ovarian <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models with correlative biomarker data. Here, we have generated further data on the effect and safety of TGN-1062 in pancreatic cancer cell line (CDX) and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, both as a single agent and in combination with standard of care (SOC) therapies.<br \/>Methods: <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies were conducted in mice engrafted with pancreatic CDX and PDX tumors and treated with TGN-1062 with and without SOC therapies. Tumors were measured to determine tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and correlating drug accumulation levels were measured in both tumors and plasma using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on tumors to determine changes in cleaved Caspase-3, MYC, Ki67, and RNA Pol II. Rats were dosed with TGN-1062 to assess plasma exposures and preliminary tolerability.<br \/>Results: In a pancreatic CDX model (MIA PaCa-2), TGN-1062 showed 38% TGI as a single agent and 121% TGI when in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, which on its own showed 37% TGI. In a pancreatic PDX model, TGN-1062 did not exhibit single agent effect, but combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel showed 95% TGI compared to 79% TGI with gemcitabine\/nab-paclitaxel alone. Drug accumulation, biomarker analysis, and IHC from CDX and PDX tumors, showed that TGN-1062 treatment decreased RNA Pol II phosphorylation and MYC expression, and induced apoptosis. Rat pharmacokinetics indicated 100% oral bioavailability.<br \/>Conclusion: Our potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of CDK7, TGN-1062, shows promise in pancreatic cancer models as a single or in combination with SOC .

CC-99282 potently degrades Ikaros and Aiolos, resulting in enhanced antiproliferative, apoptotic, and immune-stimulatory activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) models, including those with acquired chemoresistance (Lopez-Girona A, et al. <i>Hematol Oncol<\/i>. 2021). In lymphocytes, Ikaros negatively regulates gene expression via histone modifications, including polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (Oravecz A, et al. <i>Nat Commun<\/i>. 2015); in NHL, these epigenetic mechanisms are unclear. Using DLBCL models, we explored the relationship between CC-99282 activity and epigenetic status, and the mechanism of synergy of CC-99282 treatment and inhibition of EZH2, a PRC2 component. Baseline characteristics of human DLBCL lines and effects of CC-99282 &#177; tazemetostat (TAZ), a representative EZH2i, were evaluated in vitro and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, enzyme fragment complementation assays, and\/or CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing. Analysis of Ikaros\/Aiolos degradation in &#62; 20 DLBCL cell lines showed their loss is necessary, but not sufficient for CC-99282 efficacy. Evaluation of baseline histone marks showed that the sensitive cell lines exhibit aberrant, higher H3K27me3 coverage at promoter regions of expressed genes. This suggests a direct correlation between H3K27me3 status at these regions and CC-99282 sensitivity. In T cells, Oravecz et al. found that loss of Ikaros reduces H3K27me3 at specific chromatin sites due to its interaction with PRC2. We confirmed that these affected regions are enriched in genes upregulated upon CC-99282 treatment in DLBCL cell lines, suggesting a similar role for Ikaros in DLBCL. Pathway analysis following CC-99282 or TAZ treatment demonstrated high overlap between pathways altered by both agents. CC-99282 + TAZ combined demonstrated additive and\/or synergistic antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in DLBCL cell lines. This combination did not alter Ikaros degradation or overall H3K27me3 status but increased downstream effects. Results were confirmed by CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout competition assays with <i>EZH2<\/i> and other PRC2 components. This effect was independent of cell of origin, <i>EZH2<\/i> mutational status, or degree of CC-99282 sensitivity. Synergy was confirmed using the SU-DHL6 and DB xenograft models that are intrinsically resistant to EZH2is and CC-99282, respectively. Combination treatment yielded durable responses and tumor-free animals.<br \/>Collectively, these data suggest that Ikaros could act as an epigenetic modulator through PRC2 recruitment and support the combination of CC-99282 with EZH2is in NHL (NCT03930953) to favor broad and durable clinical responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6dce59b5-136d-4bed-b03d-e480bf8585e6\/@u03B8ZDx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,EZH2,Ikaros,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15092"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Soraya Carrancio<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Celia Fontanillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Galasso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martino Colombo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Wood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carla Guarinos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandro Panjkovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Jankeel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Blattler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Preethi Janardhanan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Groza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Leisten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rama Krishna Narla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonia Lopez-Girona<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel W.

To increase the efficacy vs. tolerability window of protein degradation and improve drug delivery we combine the catalytic approach of targeted protein degradation with the precision of tumor targeting therapeutic antibodies. Here, we describe the development of ORM-5029, a highly potent and selective GSPT1 degrader targeting HER2-expressing tumor cells. We first screened a panel of cell lines to identify tumors where treatment with a selective, membrane-permeable, molecular glue (SMol007) would exhibit the most potent GSPT1 degradation, integrated stress response, and ultimately apoptosis. HER2+ breast cancer cell lines were more sensitive to GSPT1 degradation than the average IC50 for all cell lines tested. Several of our GSPT1 degrader molecules were tested in HER2-positive tumor models and displayed a consistent pattern of potent cytotoxicity. An unbiased global proteomics evaluation of changes in abundance identified SMol006 as a specific GSPT1 degrader, with no significant depletion of over 6500 other proteins detected. To evaluate whether antibody delivery could provide a potency increase of Smol006 and other GSTP1 degrader payloads, we conjugated these payloads to the HER2-targeting antibodies, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Given the comparable activity of both antibodies and frequent use of trastuzumab as the antibody domain of several ADCs, we selected pertuzumab as our targeting antibody. Further medicinal chemistry optimization and evaluation of many linker-payloads led to the identification of our first preclinical AnDC candidate ORM-5029, which is composed of SMol006, a highly-potent GSPT1 degrader conjugated to pertuzumab via a clinically-validated Val-Cit PABc linker. ORM-5029 treatment in the HER2-expressing cell lines showed 10-1000 fold superiority in potency compared to SMol006, Kadcyla and\/or Enhertu treatment. We evaluated ORM-5029 in several in vivo xenograft models and observed robust efficacy, following a single-dose treatment testing as low as 3 mg\/kg. In the BT474 xenograft model, treatment with ORM-5029 demonstrated single-dose activity superior to Kadcyla, and comparable to Enhertu when given at an equivalent dose. In an HCC1569 xenograft model, tumor growth inhibition correlated with the degree and duration of GSPT1 depletion and changes in expression of previously described integrated stress response biomarker genes. ORM-5029 is currently in preclinical development as a potential first-in-class targeted protein degrader therapy with HER2-targeted delivery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/80b8f2be-59a4-4b40-a61b-87ed5869ab84\/@u03B8ZDx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,Breast cancer,Targeted drug delivery,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15093"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James Palacino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chen Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Yi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Skaletskaya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khuloud Takrouri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wesley Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min-Soo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Ki Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Da-Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeonhee Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiae Kook<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pedro Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hangyeol Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang-Mi Jee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiyun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ki-Hwan Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Fishkin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter U.

Reversible SMIs of the MDM2\/p53 interaction have been developed to stabilize p53 and to induce apoptosis in wildtype p53 tumors. However, MDM2 SMIs induce a p53\/MDM2 feedback loop, resulting in upregulation of MDM2 protein levels and p53 pathway inhibition, thus drastically limiting their biological activity and clinical application. MDM2 targeted protein degradation suppresses p53-dependent MDM2 protein feedback upregulation and is therefore expected to lead to a superior response compared to SMIs.<br \/>Objectives: We discovered KT-253, a novel, highly potent heterobifunctional MDM2 degrader. We characterized the activity and molecular mechanism of KT-253 in wildtype p53 cell lines and xenograft models and demonstrated that KT-253 has superior activity compared to SMIs in these models.<br \/>Methods: We characterized KT-253 in MDM2-dependent cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>, as well as in <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse AML and ALL xenograft models. Methods included <i>in vitro<\/i> cell proliferation and apoptosis assays, gene expression profiling, and <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacological studies.<br \/>Results: KT-253 selectively depletes MDM2 protein levels with sub-nanomolar cellular potency. We demonstrated in the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cell line RS4;11 that KT-253 can overcome the p53-dependent upregulation of MDM2 protein levels as seen for reversible SMIs. In addition, even brief exposures to KT-253 in these cells could more potently stabilize p53 compared to SMIs, leading to apoptosis mediated through p53 target genes. The superior MDM2\/ p53 pathway inhibition and induction of apoptosis by KT-253 translates into a &#62;200-fold stronger cell growth inhibition, compared to SMIs, across a panel of solid and hematological tumor cell lines. Using mouse xenograft models, we established an intermittent dosing schedule that drives anti-tumor efficacy. Importantly, a single dose of KT-253 at 1 mg\/kg resulted in sustained tumor regression in the RS4;11 mouse xenograft model. In this model, KT-253 exposures correlated with induction of apoptotic p53 target genes and tumor growth inhibition. In addition, weekly administration of KT-253 significantly prolonged the survival in a disseminated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) model when compared to vehicle treated animals.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, KT-253, our development candidate, has significantly improved potency relative to reversible SMIs leading to potent <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy that is superior to all clinically active agents. In addition, an intermittent dosing schedule of the highly potent KT-253 degrader can induce rapid apoptosis in MDM2-dependent cancer cells potentially leading to improved efficacy and safety profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5475f771-3872-4455-bf07-7c3e28f00bda\/@u03B8ZDx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDM2,p53,Heterobifunctional degrader,Leukemias: acute myeloid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15094"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yogesh Chutake<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Mayo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dapeng Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bradley Enerson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Filiatrault<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Crystal Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Placke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madison Adams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Karnik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Shaw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yatao Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dirk Walther<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alice McDonald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Qi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phillip Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph D.

Beside surgery, current therapies have narrow clinical benefits for this devastating disease, and in the majority of cases, only improve survival by a few months. Moreover, systemic toxicities are a harsh reality of these treatments. FOLFIRINOX is the drug regimen of choice, one component of which is 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) which causes serious gastrointestinal and hematopoietic toxicities and is vulnerable to resistance due, in part, to thymidylate synthase (TS) overexpression. The Gmeiner lab has pioneered the development of polymeric fluoropyrimidines, named F10 and CF10, which unlike 5-FU, are in principle completely converted to the TS inhibitory metabolite FdUMP, without generating appreciable levels of ribonucleotides that cause systemic toxicities and while displaying much stronger anti-cancer activity. Here, we further confirm the potency of CF10 and investigate enhancement of its efficacy through combination with inhibitors targeting replication stress, a hallmark of PDA cells. We show that, consistent with our previous studies in PDA cells, CF10 is much more potent as a single agent than 5-FU, by an average 308x fold, and was effective in the nM range (GI50 range 3.13 - 336 nM) in 5 PDA cell lines tested. We also found that CF10 induces increased replication stress as assessed by phosphorylation of ATR, which appears as early as 8 hours after treatment and increases in intensity over 48 hours, consistent with the kinetics of FdU being released from CF10 and incorporated into DNA, a process requiring several hours. Importantly, phosphorylation of ATR induced by CF10 was significantly higher than with 5-FU. This is especially striking because compounds for this assay were used at their IC50 concentrations, with for example MiaPaCA2 cells being exposed to 899 time more 5-FU than CF10, yet at this concentration 5-FU induced less ATR phosphorylation. Further, we find that the activity of CF10, but not 5-FU can be enhanced through combination with inhibitors of ATR and Wee1 that regulate the S and G2 damage checkpoints. Our results indicate CF10 has potential to supersede the established benefit of 5-FU in PDA treatment and indicate novel combination approaches that may be beneficial compared to well-established regimens used currently for 5-FU.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ee00596-c578-48b9-b49c-a03b92ce9f06\/@u03B8ZDx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Stress response,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Kinases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15095"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Roberto DiNiro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex O.

The prominence of oncogenic kinase signaling in a multitude of cancer types has inspired development of molecularly targeted drugs, facilitating combination treatment strategies designed to overcome adaptations such as signaling crosstalk and activation of downstream effectors. Treatments using inhibitor combinations, however, remain a challenge as clinical trials have been fraught with dose-limiting toxicities. Avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism by transport and sequestration into mesenteric gastrointestinal lymphatic vessels may improve drug exposure and reduce dose-limiting toxicities often observed in combination therapy studies. Despite potential advantages, lymphatically directed kinase inhibitors have remained unexplored due in part to limited understanding of the physicochemical properties required for lymphatic uptake of small molecules. We demonstrate a first-in-class series of orally bioavailable small molecule kinase inhibitors which are intrinsically &#8216;lymphatropic&#8217;, undergoing lymphatic absorption to achieve sustained circulatory drug levels and therapeutic benefit, with no observable toxicity. Single agent multifunctional inhibitors of high-value targets (MEK\/PI3K, MEK\/PI3K\/mTOR, &#38; MEK\/mTOR) were designed and synthesized. Compounds had unique physiochemical properties, demonstrating high lymphatic uptake in a mesenteric lymphatic vessel cannulation model and in isolated lymph nodes extracts. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice following oral administration revealed that sustained plasma blood levels were achieved within the therapeutic window for up to 24 hours. Oral bioavailability in mice was found to be 80-85% of drug administered and was constant over a single-dose range study (100 to 1,000 mg\/kg). On-target <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> inhibition of activated MEK and PI3K was also demonstrated, revealing high potency of both the parent molecule and therapeutically active metabolites. Together, these studies revealed that lymphatic sequestration of orally dosed compounds serves to provide a reservoir that circumvents pharmacotoxicity through controlled physiological drug release into the systemic circulation and avoidance of first-pass hepatic metabolism. This platform provides a template for further development of additional lymphatropic small molecule inhibitors presenting opportunities in which multi-targeted cancer treatment options can now be evaluated. Exciting new therapeutic prospects offered by lymphatropic agent development is anticipated to transform treatment options for a wide variety of cancer types such as metastasis and lymphoma along with a myriad of other diseases including autoimmune disorders.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/46558452-df06-49b4-aa4c-7b5e4424de78\/@u03B8ZDx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15097"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian D.

Despite adequate locoregional treatment, up to 40% of patients will develop metastatic disease. Doxorubicin represents the 1<sup>st<\/sup> line standard of care for patients in this setting. However, its activity is limited with a response rate of only 10%, a progression-free survival of less than 6-months. New therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed. PRMT5 belongs to a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of arginine residues on both histones and non-histone proteins. Recent evidence shows that PRMT5 is upregulated in a wide variety of cancers. Its expression and activity are associated with tumorigenesis and with a decrease in patient survival in several cancers, a rationale for developing highly potent inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed the transcriptome data from 255 translocation-related STS and 389 complex genomics STS with annotated clinical data from the French Sarcoma Group. We then investigated the anti-tumor activity of the first -in class PRMT5 specific inhibitor, GSK3226593 in a panel of 7 cell lines and in two xenograft models established at Institut Bergoni&#233; (Bordeaux, France).<br \/>Results: We found that high PRMT5 gene expression level was significantly associated with worse metastases-free survival in both translocation-related and complex genomics STS (p=0.003 and p=0.009, respectively), support the relevance of PRMT5 as a potential therapeutic target in this indication. We then found that pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 by using GSK3226593, suppressed the viability and the cell proliferation of 7 STS cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> (IC50 range between 0.01 and 1.4 &#181;M) as well as <i>in vivo<\/i> in two models of xenograft cell lines. This inhibition of cell growth was concomitant with an increase of p53 and p21 expression. However, anti-tumor activity of GSK3226593 was independent of p53 since the compound was still active in shp53 expressing cell lines. Moreover, we did not notice any significant effect of GSK3226593 on cell cycle phases or apoptosis. To decipher the mechanism of action of PRMT5 inhibition in STS, we did a comparative transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) of STS cells before and after 10 days of treatment with GSK3226593. Gene Ontology and gene set enrichment analysis revealed downregulation of metabolic processes especially glycolysis and mTORC1 pathways. A specific metabolic pathway panel was used to confirm and deepen the underlying molecular mechanism. The downregulation of several genes by GSK3226593 such as <i>PCK2<\/i> was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot. Glycolysis inhibition was confirmed by a decrease of glucose uptake.<br \/>Conclusion: PRMT5 inhibition has anti-tumor activity <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> through the regulation of STS cell metabolism providing a clear rationale for its clinical investigation in this indication.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6b8b00f9-bcae-4adb-bdad-112ad8b13e20\/@u03B8ZDx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,PRMT5 inhibitor,Glucose metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15098"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephanie Verbeke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Leroy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurelien Bourdon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanessa Chaire<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elodie Richard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Philippe Guegan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alban Bessede<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Italiano<\/i><\/presenter>.

This complex formation results in the activation of pro-survival and pro-proliferative transcriptional programs in cancer cells. Many tumor types harbor alterations in the Hippo pathway, including mesothelioma, where a high percentage of tumors are driven by YAP1\/TEAD activity. Although traditionally difficult to drug with small molecules, identification of autopalmitoylation sites in the hydrophobic palmitate pocket of TEADs necessary for YAP1 interaction has enabled modern drug discovery platforms to generate compounds that allosterically inhibit YAP1\/TAZ-TEAD complex formation and transcriptional activity. We report the discovery and characterization of the novel YAP1\/TAZ-TEAD inhibitor MRK-A from an aryl ether chemical series demonstrating potent and specific inhibition of YAP1\/TAZ-TEAD activity. In biochemical thermal shift assays, MRK-A caused a concentration-dependent melting temperature shift of 8-12.5 and 0.6-1.5 degrees for TEAD1 and TEAD2, respectively, indicating direct binding to TEAD protein. In cellular assays, MRK-A demonstrated inhibition of a TEAD-based reporter assay, with little to no activity in multiple orthogonal off-target reporter assays such as WNT, NF-KB, TGFB and PPARG (8.4 nM vs. &#62;10000 nM), which is consistent with the exquisite selectivity profile of this molecule (&#62;1000x selectivity against 350+ measured kinases and other common off-targets). In the <i>NF2<\/i>-deficient mesothelioma cell line H226, MRK-A suppressed the transcription of endogenous YAP\/TAZ-TEAD target genes <i>CYR61<\/i>, <i>ERBB3<\/i>, <i>ANKRD1<\/i> and <i>CTGF<\/i> (50-75% inhibition at 100 nM), but not LATS1, a non-TEAD regulated Hippo pathway gene<i>.<\/i> In co-immunoprecipitation assays, MRK-A disrupted the interaction of YAP1 and TEAD in H226 cells at concentrations consistent with inhibition of target genes. In addition, MRK-A potently blocked the clonogenic growth and viability of H226 cells in a dose-dependent manner (maximal response at 1 &#181;M compound &#62;90% growth inhibition), while sparing the Hippo wild-type mesothelioma cell line H28. Furthermore, structurally similar control compounds, MRK-B and MRK-C, without the ability to block TEAD-mediated transcription (TEAD reporter MCF7 assay IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 10000 nM), did not impact the clonogenic growth of H226 cells. In vivo, MRK-A did not show acute tolerability signals in mice and demonstrated pharmacokinetics suitable for daily oral dosing in efficacy studies. In summary, we report the structure and characterization of MRK-A demonstrating potent and specific inhibition of YAP1\/TAZ-TEAD mediated transcriptional responses, with potential implications for treating malignancies driven by altered Hippo signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/065272c2-f82e-4a5f-9866-9fa776ac656f\/@u03B8ZDx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"YAP\/TAZ,Mesothelioma,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15274"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Casey J.

Dysregulated function of PRC2 is implicated in the development of various cancer types. With regulatory approval of EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat, a potentially effective successful cancer therapeutic strategy is now available for patients with epitheloid sarcoma and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. However, EZH2 inhibitor activity might be reduced because of acquired resistance through secondary mutations in <i>EZH2<\/i> or its inability to inhibit paralogs of EZH2 (including EZH1). Because binding of EED with trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) is required to activate methyltransferase activity of EZH2, allosterically targeting EED is emerging as a novel approach to inhibit PRC2 (Qi et al, Nat Chem Biol 2017). APG-5918\/EEDi-5273 is a well-documented, investigational, novel, bioactive, and potent EED inhibitor (Rej et al, JMC 2021). The aim of this study was to further characterize the anticancer therapeutic activity of APG-5918 in the preclinical setting.<br \/>APG-5918\/EEDi-5273 showed high-affinity binding to EED protein in a biochemical assay (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 1.2 nM). It also exerted potent antiproliferative activity in several EZH2 mutant (<i>EZH2<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup>) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the nanomolar range and inhibitory effects that were approximately 5 times lower than those with tazemetostat.

Therefore, there is an urgent need of advanced treatment regimens. Particularly the subgroups of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers (ENBC) and the even worse triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of ENBC with a high metastatic potential, are lacking efficient treatment methods. Thus, developing more effective drugs for ENBC\/TNCB treatment remains an unmet medical need. The pro-apoptotic protein Bax in active form was shown to be downregulated in most cancers. As a result, the balance between Bax and its antagonist Bcl-2 gets disturbed, thereby leading to dysfunctional apoptotic signaling in favor of cancer cell survival. Hence, drug discovery for Bax activation is a promising approach for developing novel cancer therapies. The small molecules GL0385 and GL0388 were identified from our progenitor molecules including small-molecule Bax activator (SMBA1), CYD-2-11, and CYD-4-61. The CYD compounds specifically target the Ser184 residue of Bax and have shown apoptosis-inducing effects <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. These lead Bax activators provided proof-of-concept studies while further optimization is imperative to mitigate potential toxicity, leading to the discovery of advanced lead molecules GL0385 and GL0388. Treatment with either GL0385 or GL0388 resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT549, MDA-MB-453, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-361 cells. Additionally, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with GL0385 or GL0388 showed reduced migration and invasion, compared to control cells. Western blot analysis confirmed increased protein levels of Bax, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3, and cytochrome C. These results demonstrate that GL0385 and GL388 have a significant impact on cancer cell proliferation and cellular motility which are main attributes of metastasizing cells. Additionally, increased expression of apoptosis markers indicates that these compounds may be beneficial to regain the anti-apoptotic\/pro-apoptotic balance in breast cancer cells. <i>In <\/i>vivo, both GL0385 and GL0388 show moderate tumor growth inhibition. Further chemical optimization has achieved additional drug candidates including GL0469. Breast cancer cells treated with GL0469 resulted in significant reduction of cell proliferation. Therefore, GL0385, GL0388, and GL0469 are promising new advanced lead compounds towards the development of effective therapies for breast cancers and other cancers with improved safety profiles. Further investigation is warranted to fully explore their anti-cancer potential and mechanisms of action.

MTA is a negative regulator of PRMT5 that accumulates as a result of <i>MTAP<\/i> deletion. TNG908 selectively binds the PRMT5-MTA complex driving selective inhibition of PRMT5 in MTAP-null cancers, which is postulated to create a large therapeutic index relative to PRMT5 inhibitors currently in clinical development. TNG908 is 15X selective for MTAP<sup>null<\/sup> cell lines over isogenic MTAP<sup>WT<\/sup> cell lines, and has marked selectivity for <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted cancer cell lines independent of lineage in a large, diverse cell line panel. <i>In vitro<\/i> mechanistic studies confirm that MTAP<sup>null<\/sup>-selective PRMT5 inhibitors can selectively target MTAP<sup>null<\/sup> cancer cells in either an admixture of MTAP<sup>null<\/sup> and MTAP<sup>WT<\/sup> cells, or with intracellular MTA accumulation 2-5X relative to basal levels in MTAP<sup>WT<\/sup> cells. Oral administration of TNG908 drives dose-dependent, MTAP<sup>null<\/sup>-selective antitumor activity in multiple xenograft models, including tumor regressions in models representing non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma and squamous), cholangiocarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and others.

In particular, double-hit and triple-hit DLBCLs, with translocations involving <i>BCL2, <\/i><i>MYC<\/i> and\/or <i>BCL6<\/i>, have a very poor prognosis and occur in up to 7% of cases. Double expressor DLBCLs, with overexpression of BCL2 and MYC in the absence of chromosomal translocations, also have a poor prognosis. BCL2 inhibitors (BCL2i) have shown preclinical and clinical efficacy in lymphomas. Here, we synthesized and tested seven novel BCL2i in DLBCL cells with deregulated BCL2, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) cell lines with acquired resistance to idelalisib, copanlisib or ibrutinib.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Using in silico-based drug design complemented by classical and kinetic target-guided synthesis (KTGS) led to the synthesis of seven potential BCL2 inhibitors (BCL2i). The MTT assay was used to assess the<b> <\/b>anti-proliferative activities of BCL2i: ST-59, ST-64, ST-65, R, Z-89, Z-103, Z-116-8 in <i>BCL2-<\/i>translocated DLBCLs: SU-DHL-4, Toledo, DOHH2, KARPAS422, WSUDLCL2, Pfeiffer; BCL2 amplified DLBCL: U2932 and resistant SMZLs. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of BCL2i for 72 hours [h].<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Median IC50 values for the seven BCL2i ranged from 22 &#956;M to 49 &#956;M. ST-65 was the most potent BCL2i (range = 12 - 46 &#956;M, median = 22 &#956;M), showing anti-proliferative activity in DLBCL and SMZL. The other BCL2i were inactive in at least 2 cell lines (IC50 &#62; 50 &#956;M). The three least potent BCL2i were Z-89, Z-103 and R (median IC50 = 49, 44 and 45 &#956;M, respectively). ST-65 was the only BCL2i synthesized by BCL2 using KTGS, indicating KTGS as a superior technique for generating BCL2i. The poor activity of R agreed with its inability to cross the cell membrane as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among the resistant SMZLs, parental KARPAS1718 were most sensitive to the BCL2i, responding to 5 out of 7 inhibitors (range = 11 - 47 &#956;M, median = 22 &#956;M). The activated B cell like (ABC)-DLBCL, U2932, was only sensitive to ST-65 (IC50 = 20 &#956;M).

It has been demonstrated by both preclinical and clinical studies that blockage of this PPI with menin inhibitors has potential therapeutic effects on MLLr associated acute leukemias. NPM1 mutation (NMP1c) is a frequently mutated gene found in AML, and NMP1 mutated AML depends on menin-MLL interaction for leukemogenesis. Given the fact that wild type MLL and MLLr have similar leukemogenesis-driven target genes like <i>HOX<\/i><i>A<\/i> and <i>MEIS1<\/i>, as well as the same binding pocket on menin, it was therefore conceived that menin inhibitor could be useful to the treatment of NPM-mutated AML, which was again supported by both preclinical and clinical data. Herein, we would like to report the discovery of our proprietary menin inhibitor. Taking advantage of a couple of key interactions with menin protein, our compounds has relatively low molecular weight for a challenging PPI target, however, demonstrated comparable to or even better potency than those menin inhibitors in clinical trials. Besides <i>in vitro<\/i> pharmacology data, the DMPK, PK\/PD and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in animal model will be discussed too.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/07e490cd-c070-4473-aff0-ac537f905066\/@v03B8ZDy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Menin inhibitor,MLLr,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15371"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Taishan Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhilin Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Honghai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaochu Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quanrong Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peihua Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ye Hua<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Byran Huang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Pathway output is mediated by the YAP and TAZ transcriptional co-activators, which bind to TEAD family transcription factors to drive target gene expression. Genomic aberrations in Hippo pathway components result in constitutive activation of YAP\/TAZ, as seen with NF2 mutations in subsets of mesothelioma and other cancers. Hyperactivation of YAP\/TAZ has also been associated with resistance to a variety of targeted agents, including EGFR and CDK4\/6 inhibitors, suggesting that targeting the pathway may have utility as part of rationally selected combinations, in addition to genomically-informed monotherapy applications. Activity of the YAP\/TAZ-TEAD complex thus represents a compelling pharmacologic target, due to its essential role in the pathway, and the presence of a conserved druggable site in TEAD that is required for transcriptional function.<br \/>Results and Discussion: Using biophysical techniques, we identified novel small molecules that bind to the TEAD auto-palmitoylation pocket. Initial hits were optimized for antagonism of TEAD-based transcription and drug-like properties, ultimately producing highly potent and orally bioavailable TEAD inhibitors. These compounds selectively inhibited the proliferation of cancer cell lines harboring genomic alterations in the Hippo pathway with low nM potency. In vivo models of Hippo pathway-altered xenografts showed consistent monotherapy activity, with dose-dependent and durable tumor regressions achieved at well-tolerated doses. Further characterization of these compounds as monotherapies and as part of rationally-designed combination regimens is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4785269a-f72b-4360-acc3-f1d730a5bbd9\/@v03B8ZDy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Hippo pathway,In vivo,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15501"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adeela Kamal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurélie Candi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Versele<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bart Vanderhoydonck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arnaud Marchand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ron De Jong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thuy Hoang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georg Halder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Chaltin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen L.

AR-V7 is the most prevalent variant in CRPC, it lacks the ligand binding domain and is constitutively active in the nucleus. We and others have showed that, AR-V7 expression confers resistance to the AR signaling inhibitors (abiraterone\/enzalutamide) and to taxanes <i>in vivo<\/i> and in patients with metastatic CRPC. Since abiraterone\/enzalutamide and taxanes represent the two most effective therapeutic modalities for men with CRPC, the development of selective AR-V7 inhibitors is a high priority, clinically unmet need<i>. <\/i>AR-V7 shares with full-length AR (AR-fl), high sequence homology, largely overlapping cistromes and gene transactivation profiles. To develop selective AR-V7 inhibitors, we sought to identify unique biological features of AR-V7, that differentiate it from AR-fl and therapeutically exploit them. Mechanistic studies showed that AR-V7 utilizes a unique nuclear import pathway, not shared by AR-fl. Using fluorescently tagged-AR-fl or AR-V7 proteins in conjunction with live cell imaging, FRAP assays and pathway inhibitors, we showed that AR-V7 exhibits fast nuclear import kinetics partially mediated by the dimerization D-box domain, independently of microtubules and importin &#945;\/&#946;. Taken together, these data suggest that AR-V7 nuclear import mechanism is distinct providing a window of therapeutic opportunity to selectively target it. To identify AR-V7 selective inhibitors, we designed and performed a high throughput enzyme complementation screening (HTS) assay using nuclear AR-V7 as a surrogate for AR-V7 activity. We screened a chemical library of ~170K compounds and identified hit compounds inhibiting AR-V7 by proteasomal degradation. Among the degraders, we observed 2 main modes of action: I. compounds selectively degrading AR-V7 and II. compounds degrading both AR-fl and AR-V7. Ongoing efforts include medicinal chemistry for lead compound optimization and target validation experiments.In conclusion, we identified first-in-class selective AR-V7 inhibitors, with the potential to be clinically combined with existing, but mechanistically unrelated AR signaling inhibitors. Further mechanistic studies will elucidate their potential for future clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1029effc-949f-4d34-b0a9-9b1315ac685e\/@v03B8ZDy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Prostate cancer,Splice variants,Nuclear translocation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15502"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>CheukMan Cherie Au<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seaho Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prerna Vatsa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohd Azrin Bin Jamalruddin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Miller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter T.

Various types of androgen receptor antagonists including enzalutamide, abiraterone and apalutamide have been widely used as single agents to treat patients with advanced disease. However, despite the initial improvements, patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCPRC) frequently develop resistance, resulting in limited overall survival benefit. Darolutamide is a novel next-generation androgen receptor-signaling inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials and has shown efficacy and tolerability in treating non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. ONC201 is a small molecule belonging to the imipridone class that activates the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway and upregulates TRAIL. ONC201 has demonstrated promising antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in a variety of tumor types and is currently being evaluated in phase I\/II clinical trials. This study investigates the integrated stress response and androgen receptor signaling as mechanisms for antitumor efficacy with ONC201 and enzalutamide or darolutamide as single agents or in combination against mCRPC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Three mCRPC cell lines 22RV1, LNCaP, and PC3 were treated with ONC201, darolutamide, and enzalutamide as single agents or in combinations. In 22RV1, the single agent IC50 was calculated to be 1.22uM for ONC201, 51.5uM for darolutamide and &#62;80uM for enzalutamide. In LNCaP, the single agent IC50s are 1.67uM for ONC201, 58.7uM for darolutamide, and 4.05uM for enzalutamide. In 22RV1, the combination index (CI) of 0.38 was obtained when treated with 40uM of darolutamide and 1.25uM of ONC201, CI was 0.35 when treated with 80uM of enzalutamide and 1.25uM of ONC201. In LNCaP, CI of 0.19 was obtained when treated with 10uM of darolutamide and 0.3125uM of ONC201, CI was 0.45 when treated with 5uM of enzalutamide and 2uM of ONC201. Results showed that ONC201 synergized with darolutamide and enzalutamide and decreased cell viability. In both 22RV1 and LNCaP cell lines, when compared to single agents, combination treatments of ONC201 and darolutamide or enzalutamide reduced PSA level and demonstrated proapoptotic effects. Mouse xenograft models with luciferase expressing 22RV1 and LNCaP cell lines are currently being treated with ONC201 and darolutamide or enzalutamide as single agents or in combinations and the in vivo studies are ongoing. Our data provide insights to improved therapeutic benefits of combination treatment that can be further developed for more efficient anticancer strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1892042f-d69a-4513-918d-e29f55acf5d2\/@v03B8ZDy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ONC201,metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ,Darolutamide,Enzalutamide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15505"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jinxuan Laura Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lanlan Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leiqing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelsey E.

More than 70% of these metastatic breast cancer patients have bone metastases and median survival time from diagnosis of bone metastasis is only 2-3 years. As breast cancer bone metastases are primarily osteolytic, patients suffer from significant morbidities, including severe pain, pathological fractures, nerve compression, and hypercalcemia. Previously, it was shown that RON receptor tyrosine kinase mediates breast cancer outgrowth at metastatic sites, promotes osteolytic bone destruction, and induces systemic immune suppression. We hypothesized that inhibition of RON in specialized resident macrophages and\/or osteoclasts will eliminate metastasis through dual effects of blocking osteolysis and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. In this study, we have developed several bis(phosphonate) or phosphate conjugates of BMS-777607 and LY2801653, and report their accumulation in the bone microenvironment along with effects on osteolysis and tumor burden.<br \/>Methods: We have utilized novel synthetic schemes for synthesis of the drug conjugates. <i>In vitro<\/i> kinase assays were performed using ADP-Glo RON kinase assay kit (Promega). Hydroxyapatite binding assay was used to determine binding of drug conjugates to the bone mineral. Changes in phosphorylation of RON was demonstrated by Western blotting. Plasma pharmacokinetics and bone accumulation of lead drug conjugates in mice was assessed by mass-spectrometry. An intratibial bone metastasis model in which MSP-expressing MMTV-PyMT tumor cells are injected into the tibia of mice was used to assess the effect of treatment with lead drug conjugates.<br \/>Results: Seven novel drug conjugates were synthesized and inhibited RON kinase activity with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.060-2.4 &#181;M. Three drug conjugates demonstrated better hydroxyapatite binding when compared with BMS-777607. In agreement with the <i>in vitro<\/i> kinase activity, a variable decrease in the phosphorylation of RON was observed in cells treated with the drug conjugates. ZB-28, a monophosphonate derivative of BMS-777607, showed higher accumulation in the bone when compared with BMS-777607 but failed to block tumor-mediated bone osteolysis in an intratibial bone metastasis mouse model. Currently, a cleavable phosphate conjugate of BMS-777607 (ZB-32) is undergoing testing in the same mouse model. We have confirmed that ZB-32 and its hydrolyzed product ZB-33 accumulate in the bone to a significantly higher level than BMS-777607. These results along with preliminary ADME will be presented.<br \/>Conclusion: Targeting RON kinase in the bone microenvironment is a promising approach to alleviate morbidities observed in breast cancer patients with bone metastases. We present novel bone-targeting conjugates of BMS-777607 and highlight the potential for clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f13caa20-5a1a-46e3-addb-2e69174c6d8f\/@v03B8ZDy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Translation,Breast cancer,Bone metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15508"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Trason Thode<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaime Fornetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Rodriguez del Villar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexis Weston<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Serina Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Srikanta Dana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raffaella Soldi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohan Kaadige<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hariprasad Vankayalapati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Srinivas Kasibhatla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alana Welm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunil Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, as HASPIN belongs to atypical kinase, lacking the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif, development from the chemical library of kinase inhibitors with conventional pharmacophore, would be technically challenging. In particular, one of adenosine analogues (LJ4827), a potent inhibitor of multi-kinases, showing clear anti-cancer activity <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, was predicted as a HASPIN inhibitor by computation analysis of its transcriptome profile in cancer cells to drug-omic data set in the connectivity MAP (cMAP) as it shared similar transcriptome profile of 5-iodotubercidin (5ITU). The specificity and potency as HASPIN inhibitor of LJ4827 (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 0.45 nM) validated by in vitro kinase screening and consequent 3D structure modeling. As expected, treatment of LJ4827 in cancer cell lines efficiently delayed mitotic progression without double strand break (DSB) unlike 5ITU and significantly attenuated Aurora B localization at centromere. Along with clinical significance of HASPIN expression in lung cancer patients, mitotic gene signature closely associated to high expression of HASPIN, revealed the poor prognosis. Additional computational analysis of kinase perturbation data to predict the dependency of mitotic kinase in the absence of HASPIN activity, revealed the synthetic lethal effect of cotreatment of the chemical inhibitor of BUB1, PLK1 or AURKA with LJ4827. These data suggest that combined inhibition of HASPIN with the novel inhibitor and key mitotic kinases for centromere \/ kinetochore regulation would be effectivity therapeutic approach for cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/64b45084-ef7f-4a18-8fc1-9221464fa85c\/@v03B8ZDy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitosis,Transcriptome profiling,HASPIN,Mode of action,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15512"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eun-Ji Kwon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karishma Mashelkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyuk Woo Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoon-Ze Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lak Shin Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyuk-Jin Cha<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, strategically targeting ribosome biogenesis could be a novel approach for pancreatic cancer treatment. One such approach is to target ribosome biogenesis is via small molecule inhibitors of RNA Polymerase I as these inhibitors have shown promising anti-cancer activity in pre-clinical and clinical studies. We observed differential constitutive expression of various ribosomal proteins including RPA-194 in human PanCa cells when compared with normal HPDE cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that targeting RNA pol I will inhibit the growth of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we for the first time evaluated the therapeutic effect of a novel RNA polymerase I inhibitor (BMH-21) against PanCa in pre-clinical<i> <\/i>model systems<i>.<\/i> BMH-21 significantly inhibited the ribosome biogenesis process in various pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1, AsPC1, BxPC3, MiaPaCa-2) as determined by inhibition of rRNA synthesis and POL I occupancy on rDNA. BMH-21 treatment of pancreatic cancer cells significantly degraded RPA194 protein as determined by Western blot and confocal microscopy analysis. BMH-21 treatment (0.25-5&#181;M) showed differential IC50 in various pancreatic cancer cells which were correlated with the expression of its target proteins RPA194 and RPA135 expression. In our flow cytometry experiment, we observed a significant G0\/G1 cell cycle arrest and increase Annexin V and Annexin V7-AAD positive cells in BMH-21 treated pancreatic cancer cells as compared to the vehicle treatment group suggesting its apoptosis-inducing potential in pancreatic cancer cells. BMH-21 treatment inhibited growth and metastatic phenotypes of various PanCa cells as analyzed by various functional assays (colony formation and atomic force microscopy analyses). We also evaluated the effect of BMH-21 on various kinases, which regulate ribosome biogenesis. Interestingly, we observed BMH-21 significantly (P&#60;0.01) downregulated the phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and WNK-1 (Thr60) kinases and Stat3 phosphorylation at Ser727 and upregulates pChk2 kinase in PanCa cells. BMH-21 (2 mg\/kg i.p) significantly (P&#60;0.01) inhibited the growth of pancreatic tumor in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Excised tumor tissues of BMH-21 treated mice showed decreased expression of various ribosomal proteins including RPA194 and RPA195 along with various cell proliferative markers (ki67 and PCNA) as compared to vehicle-treated group. Taken together, our results demonstrated that targeting the ribosome biogenesis process is a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of pancreatic cancer and BMH-21 could be used as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Ribosomal RNA transcription,Antitumor agents,Kinases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15513"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carlos Perez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mudassier Ahmad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Massey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asif Shahriar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emmanuel Anning<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivek Kashyap<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neeraj Chauhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anupam Dhasmana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manish Tripathi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subhash Chauhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bilal Hafeez<\/i><\/presenter>.

MM is challenging to diagnose and treat, accounting for approximately 12% of hematologic malignancies. The overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MM. The overexpression of Mcl-1 is associated with acquired resistance and poor prognosis. Thus, inhibition of the Mcl-1 protein is an attractive therapeutic strategy against myeloma cells. We synthesized and developed a novel Mcl-1 inhibitor, KS18. The preclinical testing of this novel agent is investigated in MM cell lines. Through docking studies, we predicted that KS18 interacts with Mcl-1. KS18 down-regulates the expression of Mcl-1 in MM cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Suppression of Mcl-1 expression by KS18 correlated with activation of caspases, PARP- cleavage, and apoptosis. However, this molecule had no effect on the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. Importantly, KS18 markedly enhances the efficacies of Venetoclax and ABT-737 in MM cells. Our results propose that targeting Mcl-1 by KS18 may represent a new viable strategy for MM treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4c2d38bd-da1e-4432-bdf9-7b5530f64ba8\/@v03B8ZDy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Mcl-1,Multiple myeloma,Venetoclax,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15515"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Omar S.

Thus, developing a novel therapy to overcome this BTKi-CAR T dual resistance (Dual-R) is an urgent need. Our unpublished data revealed MYC targets and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) are highly upregulated in the Dual-R compared to BTKi-R samples. CDK9 is a critical component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex. Its inhibition induces acute decline of short-lived mRNA and proteins, especially MYC and MCL-1, in acute myeloid leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeting CDK9 may turn off MYC-driven tumor survival and drug resistance. BAY-1251152 is a novel selective CDK9 inhibitor with nanomolar potency. However, whether it has the potential to overcome BTKi-CAR T dual resistance has not been assessed.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>To validate the correlation of MYC and CDK9 with drug resistance and clinical outcome, we performed whole transcriptomic profiling using primary patient samples. To assess the <i>in vitro<\/i> efficacy of BAY-1251152, we performed cell viability assay and cell apoptosis assay using MCL cell lines and primary patient samples and followed up with functional studies. furthermore, we assessed its <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models derived from MCL patients including one with Dual-R.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>The expression of MYC oncogene associates with ibrutinib resistance and Dual-R, and poor clinical outcome. CDK9 expression does not correlates with ibrutinib resistance but it does associate with Dual-R and poor clinical outcome in CAR T-relapsed patients. CDK9 inhibition by BAY-1251152 is highly potent in anti-MCL activity in MCL cell lines with low nanomolar range of IC<sub>50<\/sub> (59.6-172.3 nM) by inducing robust cell apoptosis. BAY-1251152 induces dose and time-dependent CDK9 inhibition. A rapid decline of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, MYC, MCL-1, and Cyclin D1 can be observed as early as 2 hours. Furthermore, BAY-1251152 (10mg\/kg, QW) significantly inhibited tumor growth (p = 0.000003) in a PDX model derived from a Dual-R patient without causing apparent toxicity in NSG mice. In addition, BAY-1251152 also significantly suppressed tumor growth in the PDX models derived from a BTKi-R patient (p=0.00015) and a BTKi-venetoclax dual-resistant patient (p=0.009).<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>Our findings showed that targeting CDK9 by its specific inhibitor BAY-1251152 led to potent <i>in vitro<\/i> anti-MCL activity. BAY-1251152 induces fast CDK9 inhibition and rapid decline of MYC, MCL-1 and Cyclin D1 to induce robust cell death. BAY-1251152 is also potent in inhibiting tumor growth in PDX models. These data support that CDK9 is a promising target to overcome BTKi-CAR T dual resistance in MCL, which is in urgent need.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/90c93c7b-cd4b-4041-9b1b-1d01e41a46b1\/@w03B8ZDz\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mantle cell lymphoma,Therapeutic target,Transcriptional regulation,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21190"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vivian Changying Jiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lingzhi Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexa Jordan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Xue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fangfang Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph McIntosh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuxuan Che<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yijing Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingsong Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Leeming<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukas Simon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhongming Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jia Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.
