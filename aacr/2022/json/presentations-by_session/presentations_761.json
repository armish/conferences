[{"Abstract":"Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in cancer survivors (CS) compared to participants without a history of cancer who have at least one chronic disease (CD) and those without a chronic disease diagnosis (NCD).<br \/>Methods: Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2015 to 2018, the prevalence MetS was evaluated among participants 50 years and older (n= 5466). MetS was defined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program&#8217;s Adult Treatment Panel III. Weighted data were used to estimate the prevalence of MetS, stratified by cancer site, gender, sex, and race\/ethnicity. Chi-square test and logistic regression was used to assess group comparisons and associations respectively.<br \/>Results: Prevalence of MetS was higher among CS (71.4%) and CD (75.1%) participants compared to NCD (45.7%). Compared to NCD, participants with uterine cancer (UCa) and non-melanoma skin cancer (nMSC) had higher odds of MetS, with and without adjusting for covariates (p&#60;0.05). Those with UCa had the highest odds of MetS (OR 3.49, CI 1.51 - 8.06, p&#60;0.01)<sup> <\/sup>among all cancer types and NCD respondents. Regarding individual components of MetS, PCa survivors had lower odds of having elevated WC (p&#60;0.01) and BrCa and UCa had higher odds of having elevated WC (p&#60;0.05) after adjusting for covariates, compared to NCD. nMSC had higher odds of reduced HDL, elevated TG, and elevated WC (p&#60;0.05) after adjusting for covariates.<br \/>Conclusions: This study indicates that UCa and nMSC survivors have a strong association with MetS. In particular, nMSC survivors demonstrated statistically significant odds of meeting 3 of the 5 risk factors for MetS after adjusting for confounding variables. A better understanding of the association between MetS, its components, and specific cancers can provide insight into providing complete clinical care to CS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4cf6d4c7-e890-4432-8c0c-22be262e842a\/@z03B8ZXC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01 Population Sciences,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Metabolic syndrome,Non-melanoma skin cancer,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adaora Ezeani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanya Agurs-Collins<\/i><\/presenter>.

While prior cohort studies found positive associations of total cholesterol with advanced stage and grade in White men based mostly on cholesterol at baseline, whether associations for total cholesterol, low (LDL)- and high (HDL)-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (LDL particle component) and A1 (HDL particle component), and triglycerides exist for fatal prostate cancer and in Black men using time-updated biomarkers is unknown.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 1,553 Black and 5,071 White cancer-free men attending visit 1 (1987-1989) of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Death from prostate cancer was ascertained from the underlying cause on death certificates. Follow-up began at visit 1 and ended at date of death, loss to follow-up, or 12\/31\/2018, which ever came first. There were 128 deaths from prostate cancer (43 in Black men, 85 in White men) ascertained over 153,184 person years of follow-up (mean 23 years). We estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for fatal prostate cancer per 1-standard deviation increment and for tertiles (T1-T3) of time-updated lipid biomarkers adjusting for baseline age, education, race and field center, and updated BMI, waist circumference, smoking status, hyperglycemia and diagnosed diabetes, aspirin use, and lipid-lowering drug use overall, and in Black and White men.<br \/>Results: Higher total cholesterol concentration was associated with higher fatal prostate cancer risk in White men only (HR per-1 SD=1.25; 95%CI=1.00-1.58), and higher concentration of LDL cholesterol appeared to be associated with fatal prostate cancer in White men only (HR per-1 SD=1.26; 95%CI=0.99-1.60). Apolipoprotein B was non-linearly associated with fatal prostate cancer overall (T2 vs. T1 HR=1.66; 95% CI=1.05-2.64) and in Black men (T2 vs. T1 HR=3.59; 95% CI=1.53-8.40) but not in White men (T2 vs. T1 HR=1.13; 95% CI=0.65-1.97). HRs were &#62;1 overall (T3 vs. T1 HR=1.18) and in Black men (T3 vs. T1 HR=2.11) but were not statistically significant. HDL-cholesterol, Apolipoprotein A1 and triglycerides were not associated with fatal prostate cancer overall and by race. Tests for statistical interaction by race were not statistically significant.<br \/>Conclusion: Positive associations with fatal prostate cancer were observed with total and LDL-cholesterol in White men, and apolipoprotein B in Black men. These findings may improve the understanding of lipid metabolism in prostate carcinogenesis, and further emphasize the importance of cholesterol control.<br \/>Support: NHLBI contracts, NCI grants, NPCR","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/23248f28-f445-441f-ab1f-d52d90c04957\/@A03B8ZXD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholesterol,Apolipoprotein,Prostate cancer,Risk factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael T.

It is not known whether neighborhood obesogenic factors are associated with prostate cancer risk.<br \/>Methods: Neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) and four neighborhood obesogenic environment factors (urbanicity, mixed-land development, unhealthy food environment, and parks) were assessed for associations with prostate cancer risk among 41,563 African American, European American, Japanese American, and Latino males in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), California site. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for non-aggressive and aggressive prostate cancer, adjusting for individual-level sociodemographic, behavioral, and prostate cancer risk factors.

However, the differential oral cancer risk among users of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (ST) products has not been well studied. In this study, we estimate oral cancer incidence among adult males who were current smokers that had never used ST products (SM), ST users who had never smoked (STU), and nonusers of cigarettes or ST products (NON) using data from state-wide cancer registries and national surveys. Oral cancer incidence rates were estimated using Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas cancer registries from the years 2014 through 2017 (the most recent 4 years of available data). State-specific population counts by tobacco use status were estimated from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Missing values in tobacco use status in cancer registry data were imputed either by assuming missing at random (MR) or using multiple imputation (MI). Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) by state and age group. A random-effect meta-analysis approach was used to summarize estimates by state and age groups while considering potential heterogeneity using the Mantel-Haenszel model. Cases of oral cancer among adult males 35 years and older with tobacco use data numbered 19,536 in the geographies studied over the covered period. Assuming MR, the pooled oral cancer IRR relative to NON were 1.0 (95% CI = 0.7 to 1.3) for STU and 3.4 (95% CI = 3.0 to 3.9) for SM, resulting in an IRR of 3.5 (95% CI = 2.5 to 4.9) for SM relative to STU. The corresponding MI-based estimates relative to NON were 1.4 (95% CI = 1.1 to 1.9) for STU and 3.6 (95% CI = 3.2 to 4.1) for SM, resulting in an IRR of 2.6 (95% CI = 2.0 to 3.3) comparing SM relative to STU. These estimates should be considered in the context of certain limitations, such as the estimates were not adjusted for other potential confounding variables (e.g., alcohol intake and other lifestyle factors, duration of tobacco use, and other tobacco product use) due to the lack of such information in data sources. Our population estimates based on state cancer registry data demonstrate that current ST users had a substantially lower oral cancer risk than current smokers. While causal relationships cannot be concluded, the large sample size in this contemporary analysis suggests that oral cancer risks among smokers may be reduced by switching to ST products; however, quitting all tobacco use is the optimal path for reducing oral cancer risks.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/60a6b4e8-0736-4098-8d7a-b02cba9fd63f\/@A03B8ZXD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Oral cancer incidence rates,Cigarette Smoking,Smokeless Tobacco,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brendan Noggle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamadi Sarkar<\/i><\/presenter>.

More than 20 studies support texture features add value to risk prediction beyond breast density. However, the entire mammogram imaging data has a high dimension of pixels (~13 million per image), greatly exceeding the number of women in a cohort. We apply functional principal component analysis methods to predict 5-years breast cancer incidence using baseline mammograms. We applied these methods onto women participating in the Joanne Knight Breast Health Cohort which is comprised of over 10,000 women undergoing repeated mammography screening at Siteman Cancer Center and followed since 2010. All women had baseline mammogram at entry, provided a blood sample and completed a risk factor questionnaire. Mammograms are all using the same technology (Hologic). During follow-up through October 2020, we identified 246 incident breast cancer cases (pathology confirmed) and matched them to controls from the perspective cohort based on month of mammogram and age at entry. In a baseline model we controlled for age, menopause, BMI, and mammographic breast density (BIRADs). We then added the full image (characterized by the FPC) to the base model and further compared the AUC of the new model vs the base model using the likelihood ratio test. AUC is validated with internal 10-fold cross validation. The AUC for 5-year breast cancer risk classification increased significantly from a median of 0.61 (sd 0.09 for estimated AUCs across 10-fold internal validation) for the baseline model to 0.70 (0.10) when the full image is added, p &#38;lt; 0.001. We conclude that using full mammogram images for breast cancer risk prediction captures additional information on breast tissue characteristics that relate to cancer risk, and improves prediction classification. This prediction algorithm can run efficiently in real time (in seconds) with processing of digital mammograms. Thus, this model can be easily implemented in mammography screening services and other clinical settings to guide real-time risk stratification to improve precision prevention of the leading cancer in women world-wide. Further analysis will quantify the value of adding other breast cancer risk factors, including polygenic risk scores. Addition of repeated mammogram images over time should further increase classification performance. This approach has the potential to improve risk classification by using data already available for the vast majority of women already having repeated screening mammograms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/91bc106f-1aa4-425b-9e40-b486abf5dc72\/@A03B8ZXD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-20 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Precision medicine,Tissue factor,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shu Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Graham A.

Numerous studies failed to identify a specific microbial agent associated with prostate cancer risk. We have previously reported that human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is associated with increased prostate cancer risk in Tobago; a population that is 97% of African ancestry. This association was not found in several studies of US men, who were predominately of European American ancestry. It is unclear if the discrepancies between US and Tobago men are due to differences in HHV-8 seroprevalence rates or ancestry-related genetics. Previous studies have reported that the dinucleotide germline variant, <i>rs368234815-&#916;G<\/i>, in the <i>IFNL4 <\/i>gene encoding interferon &#955;4 is more prevalent among individuals of African ancestry and impairs viral clearance. In this study, we investigated whether the association of HHV-8 with prostate cancer is <i>IFNL4-&#916;G<\/i>-dependent.<br \/>Methods: We investigated the association of HHV-8 seropositivity with prostate cancer in 728 <i>IFNL4-&#916;G<\/i>-genotyped cases and 813 genotyped population-based control men from the NCI-Maryland Prostate Cancer Case-Control study. Associations between HHV-8 and prostate cancer were assessed in multivariable unconditional logistic regression models. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and stratified the analysis into men harboring the <i>IFNL4-&#916;G<\/i>-variant and non-carriers (&#916;G\/&#916;G or &#916;G\/TT vs. TT\/TT).<br \/>Results: HHV-8 seropositivity was higher in cases than controls (OR 1.76; 95%CI: 1.20 - 2.59). The association of HHV-8 seropositivity with prostate cancer was restricted to carriers of the &#916;G allele (OR 2.19: 95%CI: 1.38 - 3.48). HHV-8 seropositivity did not associate with prostate cancer among TT\/TT genotype carriers (OR 1.03: 95%CI: 0.51 - 2.11). Further stratification by race\/ethnicity showed that HHV-8 is associated with prostate cancer exclusively among carriers of the &#916;G allele in both European American (OR 2.59; 95%CI: 1.20 - 5.56) and African American men (OR 1.96; 95%CI: 1.08 - 3.56).<br \/>Conclusions: HHV-8 seropositivity is associated with increased odds of prostate cancer in men harboring the <i>IFNL4 <\/i>rs368234815-&#916;G variant.<br \/>Impact: The study establishes <i>IFNL4-&#916;G<\/i> as a candidate prostate cancer risk factor in men with an HHV-8 infection. This gene-environment association of <i>IFNL4-&#916;G<\/i> with prostate cancer should be further evaluated using prospective study designs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/670b0641-2f66-44c9-ab21-94ace7913d2f\/@A03B8ZXD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01 Population Sciences,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Genetic polymorphism,African American,Herpesvirus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Frank J.

However, the percent of melanoma patients harboring a germline PV is not well studied so we undertook this study to determine the number of patients with melanoma who have a PV.<br \/>Methods: Patient data was obtained from the Informed Genetically Annotated Patient (iGAP) Registry, an IRB-approved multi-center longitudinal, observational study designed to capture genetic test results and the patient&#8217;s outcome over time. A sequential series of unselected melanoma patients presenting to a single surgical oncologist&#8217;s office for treatment underwent multigene panel testing. Additionally, patients who had already undergone multigene panel testing for another reason (breast cancer) were included. The cohort was analyzed overall and in two subgroups: melanoma patients who also had a history of breast cancer and melanoma patients who have never had breast cancer. Demographics collected include age at diagnosis, race, other cancers, stage of melanoma, and thickness of melanoma.<br \/>Results: There were 170 patients, most were Caucasian (one Black, one Asian) and the average age was 60.9 years. There were 11 patients with a history of prior melanoma. There were 39 males and 131 females. Stages ranged from zero to four with a majority of them stage one. Average thickness was 2.1 mm. The overall group (170 patients) had 29 (17.06%) with a PV (one patient with melanoma and breast cancer had three PVs). The following table lists the PVs (see Table 1). There were 56 patients with melanoma and breast cancer, eight (14.3%) of which had a PV. In the melanoma without breast cancer group (n = 114), had 21 (17.5%) had a PV.<br \/>Conclusions: The cost of germline genetic testing with large panels has fallen precipitously making testing more available for many cancer patients. There have been attempts to define a group of factors in patients with melanoma who should be offered germline testing but with mixed results. Our cohort of melanoma patients (with or without breast cancer) has a PV rate of 17% suggesting that all patients with melanoma should be offered germline genetic testing. Guidelines restricting testing are no longer justified.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{00B9BD2B-862A-483A-8449-1936C39D12B4}\"><caption>Table 1 Melanoma PVs<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\">Melanoma without Breast Cancer PVs<\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><\/span><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\">Melanoma with Breast Cancer PVs<\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><\/span><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\">MUTYH-Monoallelic<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><\/span><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BLM<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CHEK2\/1100delC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ATM<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NTHL1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BRCA1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CDKN2A\/p16<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CHEK2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SDHA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CHEK2\/1100delC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ATM<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MITF<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MITF<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MUTYH-Biallelic\/Compound Heterozygous<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PMS2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NF1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MUTYH-Biallelic\/Compound Heterozygous<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PTEN<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MSH3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">FH<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BRCA2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total Melanoma w\/o Breast Cancer PVs<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total Melanoma w\/ Breast Cancer PVs<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b81d4227-1a36-40a3-954b-f394a2446324\/@A03B8ZXD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-08 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic factors,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Peter Beitsch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Chloe Wernecke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Bontempo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brenna Bentley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pat Whitworth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakesh Patel<\/i><\/presenter>.

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Patients with the genetic disorder Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) develop hundreds of polyps that unless removed by prophylactic colectomy, will progress to CRC at an early age. In recent decades, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and &#969;-3 marine fish oils such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have been evaluated for their chemopreventative potential in delaying the onset of CRC in high-risk patients. In this study, we examined the tumor protective effect of Naproxen alone, or in combination with EPA in the intestinal tumorigenesis <i>Apc<sup>am1137<\/sup><\/i> PIRC rat model. Since the free fatty acid form of EPA (FFA-EPA) is readily oxidized, we included a novel longer acting chemically stabilized form of EPA (magnesium L-lysinate bis-eicosapentaenoate), TP-252. Rats were fed a modified AIN-93G diet containing 200 ppm Naproxen, alone or in combination with two dose levels of TP-252 (1.5%, or 3%) or a single concentration of FFA-EPA (2%) by weight for 20 weeks. Rats that received 200 ppm Naproxen alone showed reduced tumor number by 66% (p &#60; 0.0001) and size by 83% (p &#60; 0.0001), respectively, compared to rats fed AIN-93G (control diet). However, when Naproxen was combined with high-dose TP-252 (3%), tumor number and size were reduced by 95% (p &#60; 0.0001) and 98% (p &#60; 0.0001) respectively, when compared to control AIN-93G diet. To elucidate potential mechanisms of tumor protection, a comprehensive lipidomic analysis was performed on colon tissue and plasma to determine potential metabolic changes associated with drug treatment. Naproxen or EPA alone resulted in significantly reduced arachidonic acid (AA)-derived &#969;-6 eicosanoids (PGE<sub>2<\/sub>, LTB<sub>4<\/sub>, and 5-HETE), but the combination of Naproxen and EPA yielded the most significant reduction that was also correlated with tumor protection. In addition, groups receiving EPA, either as FFA or TP-252, had a dose-dependent increase in anti-inflammatory EPA-derived &#969;-3 eicosanoids, as well as a panel of bioactive resolvins. Our lipidomic analysis also uncovered several lipid metabolites, including PGE<sub>3<\/sub>, RvE2, and 5-HEPE, that were correlated with tumor protection. Further studies should be focused on dose optimization, and the role of these lipid mediators in CRC initiation and progression.

Currently, anti-hormonal therapies are the only option in individuals previously diagnosed with hormone receptor positive breast cancer. However, these agents are associated with many side effects. Furthermore, there are currently no preventive options for hormone receptor negative breast cancers. To study DCIS progression, <i>w<\/i>e developed a model referred to as MIND (Mouse-INtraDuctal) in which patient-derived DCIS cells and cell lines are injected intraductally and studied as they progress to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Previously we provided strong evidence for the role of B Cell Lymphoma-9 (BCL9) as a potential driver of DCIS malignancy. We chose to target BCL9 using RE40CA and its active ingredient CA previously identified in a screen for inhibitors of &#946;-catenin binding to BCL9.<br \/>Experimental Strategy: CA and RE40CA were administered to DCIS.COM MIND animal models for four weeks by oral gavage or mixed in a powder diet formulation. Drug plasma levels were evaluated by LC-MS. Four weeks following drug administration, mammary glands were excised and evaluated for efficacy and expression of biomarkers of aggressive DCIS, nuclear &#946;-catenin and BCL9. For efficacy studies, mammary glands containing DCIS like lesions were processed and subjected to immunofluorescence staining using anti-human CK-5, anti-SMA, Dapi, &#946;-catenin and BCL9. Extent of DCIS <i>in vivo <\/i>growth, number of invasive lesions, tumor number and tumor volume were evaluated for each mammary gland.<br \/>Results: Efficacy studies showed a significant reduction in the number of invasive lesions by administration of CA by oral gavage (CA OG:10mg\/kg), CA at 200mg\/kg diet (CA200), CA400 and RE40CA 500. A significant reduction in extent of DCIS <i>in vivo<\/i> growth was achieved by CA OG and RE40CA 500. A significant reduction in the number of tumors was achieved by CA OG, RE40CA OG (25mg\/kg equivalent to CA 10mg\/kg), RE40CA 100, RE40CA 500 and RE40CA 1000. A significant reduction in tumor volume was achieved by CA OG, RE40CA OG, RE40CA 100, RE40CA 500 and RE40CA 1000. Linear regression modelling was used to compare statistical differences among the groups and differences that reached <i>p-value<\/i> &#60;0.05 were considered significant. Administration of CA or RE40CA by oral gavage was also associated with a significant loss of nuclear BCL9\/&#946;-catenin expression in DCIS epithelial cells. Dietary administration of CA and RE40CA as OG or mixed in powder diet showed an increasing trend in plasma concentrations as the dose was increased. Evaluation of HE stained sections of animal organs by histopathology showed no evidence in any tissue of necrosis, degeneration, inflammation or neoplasia. Additionally, no consistent lesions attributable to treatment were observed in any of the animals or groups.<br \/>Conclusion: Administration of CA and RE40CA are safe and effective in prevention of DCIS malignancy. Future studies are aimed at testing the efficacy of CA\/RE40CA using DCIS cell lines representing other DCIS subtypes (ER+\/PR+ and HER2 overexpressing) as well as patient derived DCIS MIND animal models.

Widely used radiographic imaging detects large-size tumors and often fails to detect changes in tumor burden. Genomics centered on gene alterations faces challenges in capturing instant status of malignancy, such as invasive\/metastatic phenotypes. In addition, tissue biopsy is highly invasive, costly, and often infeasible to repeat. Thus, novel non-invasive markers and tests that complement current paradigms for early detection and accurate tracking of tumor dynamics are urgently needed to improve clinical decision making and treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are emerging as a new class of liquid biopsy for cancer diagnosis and monitoring response to treatment. Growing evidence indicates important functions of EVs in tumor development, invasion, and metastasis, including matrix remodeling via transporting matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). However, their clinical relevance remains largely undetermined, partially owing to the challenges in EV analysis. We recently report a nanoengineered lab-on-a-chip system capable of integrative functional phenotyping of tumor-associated EVs. A generalized, high-resolution colloidal inkjet printing method was developed to afford robust and widely adaptable manufacturing of 3D nanopatterned microdevices. Enabled by this new nanofabrication technique, we built an integrated chip for multiparametric analysis of exosome circulation level, subtype, and enzymolytic activity (ExoCLUE). With various cancer cell lines and isogenic cell models created by CRISPR\/Cas9 editing, we demonstrated that this nanochip affords ultrasensitive and specific analysis detection of the expression and proteolytic activity of MMP14 on EVs to measure <i>in vitro<\/i> cell invasiveness. With the experimental and spontaneous mouse models of breast cancer metastasis, we showed that the ExoCLUE chip with low sample input enables longitudinal monitoring of <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth and metastasis in single mice. Lastly, the ExoCLUE was assessed for clinical analysis of plasma from two independent training (<i>n <\/i>= 30) and validation (<i>n <\/i>= 70) cohorts of breast cancer patients. The proteolytic activity of MMP14+ EVs showed good performance to detect the patients (AUC = 0.986 for the validation set). Combined with a machine learning algorithm, the chip-based integrative functional EV analysis enabled classification of the control, pre-malignant ductal carcinoma <i>in situ<\/i>, invasive ductal carcinoma, and locally metastatic IDC patients with a high accuracy of 92.9%. Lastly, we have scaled up the ExoCLUE system to a high-throughput nanoarray platform for highly multiplexed functional EV profiling. Overall, our nanochip technology could provide a useful liquid biopsy tool to improve animal studies and clinical diagnosis of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/172016e8-4f85-40ec-a114-0861f51a9d20\/@B03B8ZXE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-11 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Liquid biopsies,Nanoengineering,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yong Zeng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shibo Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunjie Wen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Xu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Timely, accurate, and non-invasive detection of ovarian cancer in women with adnexal masses presents a significant clinical challenge.<br \/>Patients and Methods: This intercontinental, hospital-based, diagnostic study included 761 treatment-na&#239;ve inpatients with histologically confirmed adnexal masses and 167 healthy controls from nine medical centers (China, <i>n<\/i>=3; Netherlands, <i>n<\/i>=5; Poland, <i>n<\/i>=1) between September 2016 and May 2019. The main outcomes were the performance of TEPs and their combination with CA125 in two Chinese (VC1 and VC2) and the European (VC3) validation cohorts collectively and independently. Exploratory outcome was the value of TEPs in public pan-cancer platelet transcriptome datasets.<br \/>Results: The AUCs for TEPs in the combined validation cohort, VC1, VC2, and VC3 were 0.918 (95% CI 0.889-0.948), 0.923 (0.855-0.990), 0.918 (0.872-0.963), and 0.887 (0.813-0.960), respectively. Combination of TEPs and CA125 demonstrated an AUC of 0.922 (0.889-0.955) in the combined validation cohort; 0.955 (0.912-0.997) in VC1; 0.939 (0.901-0.977) in VC2; 0.917 (0.824-1.000) in VC3. For subgroup analysis, TEPs exhibited an AUC of 0.858, 0.859, and 0.920 to detect early-stage, borderline, non-epithelial diseases and 0.899 to discriminate ovarian cancer from endometriosis. Analysis of public datasets suggested that TEPs had potential to detect multiple malignancies (Table 1).<br \/>Conclusions: TEPs had robustness, compatibility, and universality for preoperative diagnosis of ovarian cancer since it withstood validations in populations of different ethnicities, heterogeneous histological subtypes, early-stage ovarian cancer as well as other malignancies. However, these observations warrant prospective validations in a larger population before clinical utilities.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{E9C10F94-8845-47F2-8F8E-A20235F426B8}\"><caption>Table 1.

Community health centers play critical roles in providing primary care services to LGBTQ+ patients with cancer. Patients diagnosed with cancer and referred to specialty care outside health centers, however, often experience disruptions to their primary care services due to gaps in communication between primary and oncology care providers. The &#169; 4R Oncology Model (Right Information and Right Care for the Right Patient at the Right Time) is a novel, patient-centric care coordination tool developed to facilitate cancer planning and serves as a longitudinal primary care checklist for use by patients and their care team. Our project aims to assess the facilitators and barriers of 4R as a component of primary and specialized care delivered to LGBTQ+ cancer survivors.<br \/>Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with patients and their caregivers (n =12) and stakeholders (n=12) to assess facilitators and barriers to 4R implementation as a component of care delivered to LGBTQ+ cancer survivors. Research team members deductively identified initial themes from interview transcripts. Preliminary coding schemes were compared among three team members and refined by inductive coding to produce a higher-level study codebook. With this codebook, team members ultimately utilized ATLAS.ti, a qualitative data analysis software, to independently analyze interview transcripts, with discrepancies in coding resolved through team-wide discussions.<br \/>Results: Patients, their caregivers, and stakeholders agree that the 4R model shows potential for use as a first-step intervention to address primary care gaps caused by inadequate care coordination. Suggested improvements to the model include a reduction of textual information and an increased emphasis on mental and emotional support resources on the model&#8217;s sequence of care form.<br \/>Conclusions: Interim findings indicate that a lack of adequate research on solutions to the disruption of primary care services caused by the initiation of cancer care for LGBTQ+ cancer survivors is a significant barrier for this patient population. The 4R Oncology Model thus shows promise as a solution for initiating and sustaining more continuous communication between primary care and cancer care delivery for LGBTQ+ cancer survivors. Continued analysis of study interviews will further elucidate facilitators and barriers to cancer care coordination for LGBTQ+ individuals, while further informing iterations to the 4R model for the development of a national protocol aimed at improving access to care and outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals and other underserved groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e9d030eb-b8d9-44bf-9d87-e157b74d381f\/@B03B8ZXE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-03 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Survival,LGBTQ+ health,Cancer Care Coordination,Cancer care delivery model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"36d2f062-f7d7-445d-bb70-a19bc6e1a3f2","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/36d2f062-f7d7-445d-bb70-a19bc6e1a3f2\/@B03B8ZXE\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nihmotallahi Adebayo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Will Dunne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sankirtana Danner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan A.
