[{"Abstract":"Background: Preclinical studies document that complex cancer vaccines, combined with T cell agonists and anti-PD-1, can augment therapeutic efficacy. Here we report preliminary immunological analyses of patients enrolled in a first-in-human immunotherapy-trio study of multivalent autophagosome vaccine (DPV-001), with sequenced checkpoint inhibition (anti-PD-1; retifanlimab), with\/without anti-GITR agonist (INCAGN-1949), in recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (NCT04470024).<br \/>Methods: Peripheral blood (PB) and sera are collected regularly and PB are evaluated by flow cytometry. Biopsies obtained at baseline, D15 and D45 are analyzed by multiplex IF and 10x Genomics scRNA-Seq. Sera are being analyzed by phage immunoprecipitation (PhIP) sequencing for reactivity against the human proteome.<br \/>Results: Preliminary results document increases in activated CD4 and CD8 effector memory T cells (T<sub>EM<\/sub>) with vaccine alone. Changes in tumor microenvironment (TEM) were also observed with increased infiltration of immune cells. Evaluation of changes to humoral immunity, T cell function and TCR analyses are ongoing.<br \/>Conclusions: We previously reported immunological monitoring of a phase I\/II trial of an autophagosome cancer vaccine (DPV-001) containing more than 300 shared cancer antigens, as adjuvant therapy for NSCLC. Vaccination induced or augmented immune responses to more than 50 cancer antigens shared with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Preclinical studies combining this cancer vaccine with &#945;GITR agonist and &#945;PD-1 augmented therapeutic efficacy [PMID: 31747946], and provided the rationale for the current study. This is the first clinical trial to perform such a study with &#945;GITR agonist (INCAGN-1949), in humans.<br \/>Support: Incyte, Providence Medical Foundation, The Harder Family, Nancy Lematta.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/617b4ef9-887c-417b-b047-872a3740ce72\/@C03B8ZYi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,GITR,Vaccines,Head and neck cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20222"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"05917e3d-9d06-4c00-93c8-5485fc4d3e34","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/05917e3d-9d06-4c00-93c8-5485fc4d3e34\/@C03B8ZYi\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rom S.

NZV930, an investigational, CD73-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb), forms bidentate structures with the CD73 dimer, shutting down the catalytic activity of cell surface and soluble CD73. Taminadenant is an investigational A2AR antagonist and spartalizumab is an anti-PD-1 mAb. Preclinical studies provide compelling antitumor activity when combining CD73, A2AR, and<br \/>PD-1 blockade.<br \/>Methods: This first-in-human study (NCT03549000) comprised dose-escalation and dose-expansion parts. Here, we present the dose-escalation results of the four treatment (tx) arms: NZV930 single agent (SA; 60-1000 mg Q2W), NZV930 (200-600 mg Q2W) + spartalizumab (400 mg Q4W) or taminadenant (80-240 mg Q2W), or in combination with spartalizumab (400 mg Q4W) + taminadenant (80-240 mg BID). Eligible pts had selected malignancies, and disease progression following standard therapy. Primary objectives included assessing safety and tolerability and determining the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of NZV930 SA and its combinations. Secondary objectives were to determine efficacy, characterize the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of NZV930 SA and its combinations, and assess the immunogenicity of spartalizumab and NZV930. Biomarker tumor samples were obtained at screening, C2D1, and C4D1.<br \/>Results: As of June 10, 2021, 105 pts were enrolled for dose escalation, including pts with CRC (n=63), ovarian cancer (n=15), pancreatic cancer (n=11), NSCLC (n=8), TNBC (n=5), RCC (n=2), and prostate cancer (n=1). Most pts (81%) had been treated with &#8805;3 lines of prior therapy. In total, 98 pts discontinued, mainly due to disease progression (72%); six were ongoing. At least one tx-related adverse event (TRAE) was reported by 89 pts (85%); these were mostly grade 1-2. A triad of headache, fever, and nausea\/emesis was observed after the first infusion of NZV930. Most common TRAEs (&#8805;30%) were headache (67%), nausea and vomiting (32% each), and pyrexia (30%). At least one grade &#8805;3 TRAE was reported in 15 pts (14%); headache (4%) was most common, accounting for 4\/7 DLTs (all grade &#8805;3). There were no tx-related deaths. Overall, no responses were reported; 12 pts (11%) had stable disease and 69 pts (66%) had progressive disease. NZV930 has good PK properties, with target-mediated drug disposition at lower doses, which normalize to typical IgG-like PKs at higher doses. Biomarker data confirm CD73 target engagement in plasma. Adenosine pathway modulation in tumors and plasma was seen post-NZV930 tx.<br \/>Conclusions: NZV930 reduced adenosine levels in plasma and tumors. The RDE of NZV930 SA or in combination with spartalizumab and\/or taminadenant is 600 mg Q2W with a step-up dosing regimen. NZV930 SA and its combinations exhibited a tolerable safety profile in multiple advanced solid tumors and showed good PK properties.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6774c7f-853d-4d68-85ee-14ae31ddcd5f\/@C03B8ZYi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Advanced cancer,NZV930,spartalizumab (PDR001),taminadenant (NIR178),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20223"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"f7e944e7-45e6-4b1d-af4c-9d19cb776c95","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f7e944e7-45e6-4b1d-af4c-9d19cb776c95\/@C03B8ZYi\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Siqing Fu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Udai Banerji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe L.

D-1553 is a novel, potent and orally bioavailable KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor. Here we present the safety, tolerability and PK and preliminary efficacy of D-1553 from a phase I trial in patients (pts) with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation.<br \/>Method: Key inclusion criteria: KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> identified by molecular testing, measurable disease, and refractory to or intolerant of standard therapy. D-1553 dose escalation included oral daily (QD) doses of 150, 300, 600, 800, and 1200 mg, and twice daily (BID) doses of 400, 600, and 800 mg. Primary endpoint: safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary endpoints: PK parameters, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR), evaluated per RECIST 1.1.<br \/>Results: As of Dec 27, 2021, 22 pts (12 [54.5%] male, median age 65 [range: 49-90]), including 14 pts with CRC, 6 pts with NSCLC, and 2 pts with other solid tumors, were enrolled. D-1553 was well absorbed, with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T<sub>max<\/sub>) of 1-4 hours. The C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC of each dose group (150-600 mg, QD; 400-600 mg, BID) increased linearly as the dose increased. However, the changes of C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC in 600-1200 mg (QD), 600-800 mg (BID) groups were not in a dose-dependent manner. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) (frequency &#8805; 10%) were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and lethargy, all grade &#8804; 2. Thirteen pts (59.1%) had TRAEs: 11 pts (52.4%) had grade 2 or lower TRAEs; 2 (9.1%) had three grade &#8805;3 TRAEs (hypokalemia, hypertension, anaemia). No DLT has been reported. MTD was not reached. One pt (4.5%) discontinued the D-1553 therapy due to cerebral hemorrhage. This event was evaluated by investigator as unlikely related to the drug. Among 21 evaluable pts (including 14 CRC, 6 NSCLC, and 1 endometrial carcinoma (EC), confirmed ORR and DCR were 19.0% (4\/21) and 85.7% (18\/21), respectively. One pt with EC achieving PR had the best tumor burden reduction of 80%.<br \/>Conclusion: In patients with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutated solid tumor, D-1553 is well tolerated with no DLTs at studied doses.

D-1553 is a novel and potent small molecule inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>. Here we present the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy of D-1553 in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutated NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Key inclusion criteria: KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> identified by molecular testing, and after progression of standard therapy. Oral daily (QD) doses of 600, 800 and 1200 mg, and twice daily (BID) doses of 400 and 600 mg were assessed in dose escalation part; 600 mg BID was assessed in dose expansion part. Endpoints included safety, PK parameters, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR), evaluated by RECIST 1.1. Efficacy results included 6 NSCLC pts from dose escalation part of another Phase I study of D-1553 [NCT04585035] with similar inclusion\/exclusion criteria as this study.<br \/>Results: As of Dec 27, 2021, 16 pts with NSCLC (15 [93.8%] male, median age 61 [range: 30-74]) were enrolled in dose escalation part and 8 pts were evaluated in dose expansion part. D-1553 was well absorbed, with a median time to reach t<sub>max<\/sub> in 1-4 hours. The C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC of each dose group tested (400 mg and 600 mg, BID) increased linearly as the dose increased. However, the changes of C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC in 600, 800 and 1200 mg (QD) group were not dose-dependent. No DLTs had been reported in dose escalation part. 15 pts (93.8%) had treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), most of which were grade 1-2. The most frequently reported TRAEs (frequency &#8805; 15%) were elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and conjugated bilirubin, rash, anemia, asthenia, decreased appetite, hyperuricemia, and increased &#947;-glutamyltransferase. Among the 28 pts (including 14 pts from dose escalation, 8 pts from dose expansion, and 6 pts with NSCLC from another D-1553 study) evaluable for tumor response, 12 pts had partial response (PR), and 14 had stable disease (SD). ORR and DCR were 42.9% (12\/28) and 92.9% (26\/28), respectively. Among the 11 pts in 600 mg BID group, 6 pts had PR, and 3 had SD. ORR and DCR were 54.5% (6\/11,) and 81.8% (9\/11), respectively. Most of the patients with PR or SD were continuing on study at the time of the data cut-off.<br \/>Conclusion: D-1553 is well tolerated with no DLTs at studied doses. Early results demonstrate significant anti-tumor activity of single-agent D-1553 in pts with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutated NSCLC. This study is ongoing.

We used dose-exposure (D-E) and exposure-response (E&#8209;R) modeling and simulation to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The D-E modeling is expected to apply to any cancer and batiraxcept combination, while the E-R modeling may be disease specific.<br \/>Patients and Methods: A population pharmacokinetic (PK) \/pharmacodynamic (PD) model was applied to exposure data from healthy volunteers (n=24, Phase (P) 1 study, single ascending dose cohort [NCT03401528]) and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) patients (n=42, P1b study [NCT03639246]) treated with either batiraxcept+paclitaxel or batiraxcept+pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to capture the D&#8209;E relationship of batiraxcept. A Cox Proportional Hazards Model was applied to progression-free survival (PFS) observed from the PROC patients, to capture the E&#8209;R relationship of batiraxcept. The models were used to study PFS in prospective studies of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg\/kg administered iv once every 2 weeks at the 10th, 50th (median), and 90th percentile of expected exposure metrics. In a separate P1b study in 2L+clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), 23 patients were dosed with 15mg\/kg or 20mg\/kg batiraxcept in combination with standard of care cabozantinib [NCT04300140]. PK, PD, and clinical response data from both doses tested in ccRCC were compared to the modeling predictions generated from the PROC study.<br \/>Results: The PROC E&#8209;R analysis predicted that a dose of 15mg\/kg would provide exposure levels associated with longer PFS, and a 20mg\/kg dose did not add additional benefit. Fifteen mg\/kg was identified as the RP2D from the PROC P1b study and is the batiraxcept dose being evaluated in combination with standard of care weekly paclitaxel in the ongoing PROC P3 study [NCT04729608]. PK and PD data from the ccRCC P1b study compare favorably with simulations from the PROC D-E model. Consistent with simulations from the PROC E-R analysis, the 20mg\/kg dose did not provide additional benefit above that seen with the 15mg\/kg dose in the ccRCC P1b study, indicating these doses are at the plateau of drug effect.<br \/>Conclusion: Consistent with emerging U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance around a more thoughtful approach to dose selection in cancer (&#8220;Project Optimus&#8221;), E&#8209;R analysis supported the identification of batiraxcept 15mg\/kg as the RP2D in the PROC P1b study. Furthermore, PK\/PD and preliminary activity of batiraxcept 15mg\/kg+cabozantinib are consistent with these data and support the batiraxcept RP2D of 15mg\/kg across different tumor types and combinations with batiraxcept.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e514c868-216d-4660-97b8-48c38fc6d283\/@C03B8ZYi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL01-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Ovarian cancer,Renal cell carcinoma,Axl,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20226"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gail Mcintyre<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reshma Rangwala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael G.

ATP128 vaccine targets 3 antigens: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Survivin and Achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (ASCL2); it is used in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in the treatment of MSS\/MMR proficient stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, after first line of standard of care therapy or as perioperative administration in patients with resectable liver metastases.<br \/>Method: KISIMA-01 (NCT04046445) is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1b trial to investigate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of AT128 alone or in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody ezabenlimab in patients with stage IV CRC. ATP128 is given SC q2w for the first 3 immunizations (prime) and q4w for the last 3 immunizations (boost). Ezabenlimab is administered q3w starting with the first ATP128 administration. Blood and tissue samples are collected before, during and after ATP128 treatment to monitor the induction of a tumor associated antigen-specific immune response (ELISpot) and immune-related changes in the peripheral blood and in the tumor microenvironment by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: In more than 50% of evaluated patients treated with ATP128 alone or with ezabenlimab, a cellular immune response against at least one out of three antigens was observed as determined by IFN-&#947; ELISpot analyses of patient PBMCs after the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> vaccination. Analysis of liver metastases by IHC indicated that evaluated patients were positive for all 3 antigens in ATP128. Furthermore, for the patients with paired biopsies, a significant increase in CD8 T cells infiltration into the tumor parenchyma was observed after 3 vaccine administrations, along with a significantly higher proportion of CD45RO expressing memory cells within the CD4 population as compared to baseline. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) flow cytometry analysis comparing untreated (historical controls) and ATP128\/ezabenlimab-treated patients showed a similar quantity of the different infiltrated subsets but an improved quality of infiltrated T cells, indicated by an increase (more than 2-fold) in proportion of central memory T cells and an impressive decrease of the proportion of cells positive for exhaustion markers expression in KISIMA-01 patients.<br \/>Conclusions: Analyses indicate induction of ATP128-specific immune response in the peripheral circulation and increased infiltration of TILs into liver metastases with an improved quality of T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d93c8e8e-c0d5-42c9-8196-80aeaf68ef7e\/@C03B8ZYi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Vaccines,Therapeutic proteins,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20227"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Heinz-Josef Lenz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanz Prenen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Van Cutsem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thibaud Kössler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-François Mayol<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Trapani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthieu Tihy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Rubbia-Brandt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Toso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Bogenrieder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Elodie Belnoue<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madiha Derouazi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Kopetz<\/i><\/presenter>.

We present initial results of the dose-expansion phase in pts with advanced cervical cancer naive to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: Pts with histologically confirmed, locally advanced, or metastatic cervical cancer who failed prior standard-of-care chemotherapy or who experienced early progression on definitive chemoradiation and were naive to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 1 of 2 doses of vibo (200 or 700 mg) + pembro (200 mg) Q3W for &#8804;35 cycles (~2 y) or until PD, toxicity, or pt withdrawal. Primary end points were safety and tolerability. Secondary and exploratory end points included ORR, DOR, and PFS by investigator review per RECIST v1.1.<br \/>Results: Median age of the 80 pts with cervical cancer was 49 y; 58% had an ECOG PS of 1; 53% received &#8805;2 prior lines of therapy; and 61% had PD-L1-positive tumors. 41 pts received vibo 200 mg, and 39 received vibo 700 mg. Median follow-up was 12 mo (range, 5-26). Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 27 pts in each treatment group (66%, vibo 200 mg; 69%, vibo 700 mg). The most frequent TRAEs (&#8805;15%) were rash (22%), increased lipase (17%), and pruritus (17%) with vibo 200 mg +<sub> <\/sub>pembro and pruritus (28%), pyrexia (21%), rash (15%), and fatigue (15%) with vibo 700 mg + pembro. Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs occurred in 29% (vibo 200 mg + pembro) and 18% (vibo 700 mg + pembro). No deaths due to TRAEs were reported. Efficacy is reported in the Table.<br \/>Conclusions: Vibo + pembro was safe in pts with advanced cervical cancer. Antitumor activity was comparable between the 2 doses of vibo studied and responses were observed irrespective of PD-L1 status. Based on these data, the RP2D for vibo remains 200 mg Q3W.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{0D2386DF-6555-46F3-A7B2-005FFDD7BAC8}\"><caption>Efficacy<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>By Treatment Group<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>By PD-L1 Status<sup>a<\/sup><\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Vibo 200 mg +<br>Pembro n = 41<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Vibo 700 mg +<br>Pembro n = 39<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD-L1-positive n = 49<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD-L1-negative n = 21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Confirmed ORR, % (95% CI) <\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15 (6-29)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23 (11-39)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20 (10-34)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 (3-36)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>CR, n (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (13)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (12)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (5)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>PR, n (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (10)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (10)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (10)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>SD, n (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12 (29)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (18)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 (29)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (14)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>PD, n (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18 (44)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19 (49)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20 (41)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12 (57)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Median DOR, months (range)<sup>b <\/sup><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not reached (10 to 31+)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not reached (4+ to 35+)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not reached (4+ to 35+)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not reached (21 to 27+)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Median PFS, months (95% CI) <\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (2-4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (2-4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (2-4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (1-4)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">CR, complete response; DOR, duration of response; PD, progressive disease; ORR, objective response rate; PFS, progression-free survival; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease.<sup><\/sup> <sup>a<\/sup>PD-L1 status was unknown in 10 patients; data were pooled across treatment groups.

Participants were randomized to receive one of two doses of an online diet and PA didactic and experiential program, with outcomes measured at 6 months. The low-dose arm received a single 2-hour Zoom session delivered by a dietitian, a chef, a culinary educator, and an exercise physiologist; the high-dose arm received 12 2-hour Zoom sessions over 6 months. All participants received weekly motivational text messages, a Fitbit to self-monitor PA, and study website access. The primary objective was to evaluate overall feasibility based on accrual, adherence, and retention. Prespecified feasibility endpoints were 75% retention at 6 months and 60% of high-dose arm participants attending at least 8 of the 12 sessions. Secondary objectives were to compare high vs. low dose intervention effects on 6-month changes in fruit\/vegetable servings per day (24-hour dietary recall), MVPA minutes per week (accelerometry), and blood and stool biomarkers.<br \/>Results: From December 2019 to January 2021, 74 women were accrued. On average, women were 57.9 years old, 4.8 years post-diagnosis, with body mass index of 29.1 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>. Most were<sup> <\/sup>non-Hispanic white (89.2%), 51.4% were diagnosed at stage I, and 40.5% were on endocrine therapy. Questionnaire and biospecimen data collection at 6-months were completed for 93.2% and 83.8% of the sample, respectively. In the low-dose arm (n=36), 94.4% of participants attended the single class, while in the high-dose arm (n=38) 84.2% of participants attended at least 8 of the 12 sessions live or via video archived on the website (mean 9.4 sessions). On average over the 6-month intervention period, participants responded to 71.5% of the text messages, 73.0% wore their Fitbit device &#8805;50% of the time, and 77.0% accessed the study website. Mean vegetable intake increased by 1 serving per day among women in the high-dose arm and decreased slightly among women in the low-dose arm (P=0.03). Changes in fruit\/vegetable intake and MVPA varied little by arm. Blood and stool biomarker analyses are ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: We successfully conducted a remotely-delivered diet and PA intervention for BC survivors with high accrual, adherence, and retention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women in the high-dose arm increased vegetable intake relative to the low-dose arm. Future research will refine and test the intervention in a larger and more diverse study population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/44a09843-6d07-4541-8fff-7f522c83ee3a\/@C03B8ZYi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Physical activity,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20229"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"95d06d2f-1d0c-444a-9f63-3f18254fc69b","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95d06d2f-1d0c-444a-9f63-3f18254fc69b\/@C03B8ZYi\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Heather Greenlee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Yung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofia Cobos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eileen Rillamas-Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanjie Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuhan Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sidney M.

All patients had experienced at least 2 lines of previous treatment (range 2-6 lines, median 3 lines). All treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were Grade 1. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. The most frequent treatment-related AEs were local injection reactions and itchy skin. Six patients exhibited stable disease (disease control rate 66.7%) and 3 patients had tumor shrinkage. Two of the 9 patients obtained over-long progression-free survival (PFS) of 16.0 months and exceeded 28.3 months, respectively. Three patients are still surviving so far. Their OS time had exceeded 18.4 months (C-02), 28.3 months (A-02) and 29.4 months (A-01), respectively. For the overall, The median PFS was 16.6 weeks (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 7.0-26.2 weeks) and the median overall survival (OS) was 31.6 weeks (95% CI, 26.9-36.3 weeks). Exploratory single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed the existence of functional NKT cells in these three patients with long-term survival. Functional NKT cells have been demonstrated by CD57\/CD8 double-positive co-expression dynamics using cyclical FACS assay, with a co-expression index over 12~13% for A-02 patient lasting to the latest of 28 months after the end of treatment and over 13.8% for C-02 patient for a duration about 12 months and declined shortly before disease progression.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study proves the clinic safety and preliminary efficacy of 3D-pluripotent stem cell biologics in the clinic. The final dose of 2.5*10<sup>7<\/sup> 3D stem cells injected every 7 days in a 28-d cycle was well tolerated. This protocol has a promising prospect with the characteristics of low toxicity and exceptional efficacy to convert the utility to long-term survival. Functional NKT cells may play a key role in this therapy by MHC unrestricted immunocompetence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/00436f9d-c559-46f8-9d67-72f1dfe29799\/@C03B8ZYi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,NSCLC,3D-pluripotent stem cell biologics,Safety,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20230"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meijuan Huang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiancheng Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yaling Long<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanna Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Panyan Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nanxi Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanying Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaojuan Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youling Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ke Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiang Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongsheng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>You Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuquan Wei<\/i><\/presenter>.

AMP945 is a selective oral inhibitor of FAK. Following a favorable pre-clinical evaluation, we report the results of a Phase 1, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial of AMP945.<br \/>Methods: For the SAD portion, four cohorts of eight healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 56 years received either single doses of AMP945 (n=6\/cohort) of 15, 30, 60, or 125 mg per oral or matching placebo (n=2\/cohort) per oral. For the MAD portion, three cohorts of eight healthy volunteers received either AMP945 (n=6\/cohort) at 25, 50, or 100 mg once daily (QD) per oral or matching placebo (n=2\/cohort) per oral QD on each of 7 consecutive days. Blood plasma samples were collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses pre-dose at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h post-dose in SAD cohorts, and at the same time points up to 24 h post-dose on Days 1 and 7 in the MAD cohorts. Target engagement through FAK activity (phosphorylation; p-FAK) was assessed in skin biopsies taken before and after dosing in the 125 mg AMP945 (SAD) and 25, 50, 100 mg AMP945 (MAD) cohorts. Safety and tolerability were assessed according to incidence, nature and severity of adverse events (AEs).<br \/>Results: AMP945 was well tolerated at all doses studied. There was no increase in the incidence or severity of AEs with increasing doses and no treatment-related changes in laboratory parameters. AEs were mainly mild and deemed not related or unlikely related to AMP945 by the Investigator with headache, backpain and pyrexia being the most commonly observed events. After single doses of AMP945 the mean time to maximum plasma concentration ranged from 1 to 6 h post-dose. Maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve increased proportionally with dose. Mean C<sub>max<\/sub> values ranged from 55.4 to 407 ng\/mL and AUC<sub>0-inf<\/sub> ranged from 1,086 to 10,567 h.ng\/mL respectively. The mean half-life of AMP945 ranged from 15.7 to 23 h supporting the feasibility of QD dosing. The mean apparent volume of distribution ranged from 328 to 463 L, indicating wide tissue distribution. In skin biopsies, p-FAK levels following doses of AMP945 were reduced in a dose-dependent manner: there was a significant (linear) relationship observed between the decrease in p-FAK from baseline and AMP945 AUC<sub>0-inf<\/sub> following dosing with 25, 50, 100 and 125 mg of AMP945.<br \/>Conclusions: AMP945, a selective FAK inhibitor, was well tolerated across SAD (15 to 125 mg) and MAD (25 to 100 mg) cohorts in healthy volunteers. AMP945 PK and pharmacodynamic data demonstrate wide tissue distribution and target engagement. These data support continued development of AMP945 in patients with solid tumors and fibrotic diseases in which FAK inhibition could be beneficial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5ae962a1-c433-486c-93da-6e12237766b8\/@C03B8ZYi\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Pharmacodynamics,Pancreatic cancer,Pharmacokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20231"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John Lambert<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher J.

However, little is known about the effectiveness of a technology-based intervention in improving symptom experience of racial\/ethnic minorities including Asian American breast cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a technology-based intervention in improving symptom experience of Asian American breast cancer survivors.<br \/>Methods: This study was conducted as a part of an ongoing randomized clinical trial among 199 Asian American breast cancer survivors. The technology-based intervention included three sub-ethnic specific social media sites, interactive online educational sessions, and online resources. Both groups (intervention and control groups) used the American Cancer Society&#8217;s website on breast cancer, and only the intervention group used the technology-based intervention. Only the data collected using the questionnaire on background characteristics and health\/disease status and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS) were analyzed for this study. The data were analyzed using separate intent-to-treat growth curve models.<br \/>Results: While both groups reported decreases in symptom scores from the pre-test to post 3-months (p&#60;.01), the intervention group had larger decreases in symptom scores compared with the control group (p&#60;.01). There existed significant group * time interactive effects on the Global Distress Index (<i>&#946; <\/i>= - 0.234), the Physical Symptom Distress scores (<i>&#946; <\/i>= -0.266), the psychological symptom distress scores (<i>&#946; <\/i>= - 0.212c), the total number of symptoms (<i>&#946; <\/i>= -0.261), and the total symptom distress scores ( <i>&#946; <\/i>= -0.261).<br \/>Conclusions: The findings<b> <\/b>of this study clearly indicated symptom improvement among Asian American breast cancer survivors by a technology-based intervention using computers and mobile devices.

By an &#8220;imbalanced&#8221; design with a lower binding affinity to CD47 and a higher binding affinity to PD-L1, preclinical models showed IBI322 blocks CD47 on CD47+\/PD-L1+ tumors more selectively than a regular CD47 monoclonal antibody does, with minimal impact on RBCs. We conducted first-in-human, phase I study of IBI322 monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. Here, we report the results from early dose escalation\/expansion part of the study.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients (18-75 years of age, ECOG PS 0-1) had locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic solid tumors without available therapies to confer clinical benefit. The dose escalation (0.01 to 45 mg\/kg, QW\/Q2W\/Q3W, IV) followed an accelerated titration and a standard 3+3 design. Dose expansion part was conducted at 10-30mg\/kg<sup> <\/sup>Q2-3W groups. The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity (per RECIST v1.1) of IBI322.<br \/>Results: As the data cut-off date on October 12, 2021, 58 patients were enrolled (age: 53&#177;11.7 years, 37 [63.8%] males, ECOG PS 1: n=38 [65.5%], previously ICI treated: n=15 [25.9%]). Only one DLT of grade 4 reversible thrombocytopenia was observed at 20mg\/kg Q2W group. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 43 (74.1%) patients. The most frequent TRAEs including anemia (31.0%), thrombocytopenia (22.4%), and pyrexia (15.5%). Grade &#8805;3 TRAEs occurred in 13 (22.4%) patients, the most frequent Grade &#8805;3 TRAE was thrombocytopenia (12.1%). All thrombocytopenia was asymptomatic, transient, and reversible within 10 days. No thrombocytopenia led to any hemorrhage. Investigator-determined immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 (17.2%) patients. Two (3.4%) patients experienced infusion reaction. Among 20 patients treated at active doses (&#8805;10 mg\/kg) and with at least one tumor assessment, 4 (20%) achieved PR, and 7 (35%) achieved SD. Among 9 patients with NSCLC (including 4 patients failed on prior ICI treatment) who were treated at active doses (&#8805;10 mg\/kg), 3 (33.3%) achieved PR, and 5 (55.6%) achieved SD. As of data cut-off date, all these 4 patients achieved PR mentioned above still remained on IBI322 monotherapy.<br \/>Conclusion: IBI322 monotherapy showed a manageable safety profile with a promising anti-tumor activity in heavily treated patients with advanced malignancies.

Pharmacokinetics and efficacy will also be evaluated.<br \/>Methods: This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized study of BI 905677, administered intravenously, in patients with advanced, unresectable and\/or metastatic solid tumors. Patients were refractory to or not eligible for standard therapy. Patients were treated at increasing intravenous doses of BI 905677 (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 2.8 and 3.6 mg\/kg every 3 weeks [q3w]) until progression. Subsequent patients within a cohort were treated &#8805; 72 hours apart to allow adequate monitoring for cytokine release syndrome and implementation of preventive measures if required.<br \/>Results: As of November 23, 2021, 37 patients have received BI 905677. The median age was 56 years (range 32-77) and most were male (65%) and had ECOG PS 1 (51%). At 3.6 mg\/kg, 3\/3 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and dose was reduced to 2.8 mg\/kg, which was determined as the MTD. Patients received a median of 2.0 cycles (range 1-6). Across all dose levels, 19 patients (51%) experienced Grade &#8805; 3 adverse events (AEs). The most common Grade &#8805; 3 AEs were vomiting (11%), hyponatremia (8%), anemia (5%), diarrhea (5%), abdominal pain (5%), nausea (5%), hypokalemia (5%), pain (5%) and increased alkaline phosphatase (5%). No related Grade &#8805; 3 AEs were reported for doses &#8804; 1.6 mg\/kg, and BI 905677 was considered well tolerated &#8804; 2.8 mg\/kg. There were two Grade 5 events not related to study drug (tumor lysis syndrome and disease progression). DLTs observed at 3.6 mg\/kg were hyponatremia, increased &#946;-CTX expression (&#62; 2-fold versus baseline), diarrhea, hyperbilirubinemia and vomiting. Exposure to BI 905677 increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner over the complete dose groups tested. No drug accumulation between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 was observed for any cohort. Only six patients presented with anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), including one with pre-existing ADAs. Axin2 expression by reverse transcription PCR was reduced in paired skin biopsies but no dose dependency was observed. Across all doses, the best response was stable disease (n = 13; 35%).<br \/>Conclusions: BI 905677 was well tolerated, with the MTD established as 2.8 mg\/kg q3w. An expansion cohort to evaluate the activity of BI 905677 in a molecularly selected population for Wnt ligand dependence is planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/772016ee-3ea2-43f0-8384-6d90d7042acf\/@D03B8ZYj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,Bispecific antibody,Solid tumors,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20234"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"89f8b750-4de1-41fb-a8e0-37237e2f3f6a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/89f8b750-4de1-41fb-a8e0-37237e2f3f6a\/@D03B8ZYj\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elena Élez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heinz-Josef Lenz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maja De Jonge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rona Yaeger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshihiko Doi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linda Pronk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Teufel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristell Marzin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josep Tabernero<\/i><\/presenter>.

In a phase I\/IB trial, we tested the oral MEK 1\/2 inhibitor, binimetinib, with EGFR-TKI, erlotinib, to establish MTD and evaluate safety of combination in patients with NSCLC harboring KRAS or EGFR mutations.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Patients with advanced\/metastatic NSCLC with at least 1 prior line of treatment (unless with activating EGFR mutation which could be treatment-na&#239;ve) were enrolled. The Phase I dose-escalation portion used a 3+3 design to determine the RP2D. Phase IB expansion enrolled patients with either KRAS- or EGFR-mutant NSCLC using the RP2D determined in Phase I. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of binimetinib plus erlotinib in both phases. Tumor assessments were performed every two 28-day cycles. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analyses and tumor sampling was assessed to explore the biomarkers that could predict response or resistance to the binimetinib and erlotinib combination. Statistical analyses were performed via SAS 9.4.<br \/>Results: 43 patients were enrolled (dose-escalation = 23; expansion = 20). Median age: 67 years (range 32-80); Females: 20 (47%); ECOG performance status 1: 37 (86%); never\/former\/current smokers: 10\/27\/6 (23%\/63%\/14%); and median 2 prior lines of treatment (range 0 - 5). 17 patients (40%) harbored EGFR mutation (10 exon 19 del, 6 L858R substitution, 1 G719D) and 22 (51%) harbored KRAS mutation (10 G12C, 11 other). The RP2D was erlotinib 100 mg QD continuously and binimetinib 15 mg BID x 5 days\/week. The most common AEs across all dose levels included diarrhea (69.8%), rash (44.2%), fatigue (32.6%), and nausea (32.6%). Adverse events were primarily grade 1 or 2. Among the 43 patients enrolled, 9 (21%) achieved partial response (PR), 10 (23%) achieved stable disease (SD), and 9 (21%) had progressive disease. The remaining 15 patients (36%) were not evaluable for response. Among KRAS-mutant patients, 1 (5%) had confirmed PR (with G12D) and 8 (36%) achieved SD. Among EGFR-mutant patients, 9 were TKI-na&#239;ve including 8 PR (89%); 8 were TKI-pretreated with no PR and 1 (13%) SD. Median OS overall was 17.0 months (95% CI: 12.0, N.E.) and median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI: 3.6, 22.2). Pharmacokinetics of binimetinib were comparable to historical data with no evidence of significant drug interaction with erlotinib. Correlative analyses are underway to assess on target effects, outcomes by mutation subtype and resistance mechanism.<br \/>Conclusion: Binimetinib plus erlotinib demonstrated a manageable safety profile and modest efficacy including one objective response in a patient with KRAS mutation. With novel small molecule inhibitors of RAS and selective EGFR and other MAPK pathway inhibitors in development, these results support that such combination targeted approaches may hold clinical utility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e9c1723d-9656-4060-84f6-650e4549a5f0\/@D03B8ZYj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,NSCLC,EGFR,MEK inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20235"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andreas N.

Here we provide a pooled analysis of biomarkers from two studies in heavily-pretreated, postmenopausal women with ER+\/HER2- aBC.<br \/>Methods: Pooled analysis included study data from AMEERA-1 (NCT03284957), in which pts received single-agent amcenestrant in dose escalation (20-600 mg QD or 300 mg BID) and dose expansion (400 mg QD), and from AMEERA-2 (NCT03816839), in which Japanese pts received single-agent amcenestrant at 400 mg QD or 300 mg BID. Mutational profiling of plasma circulating cell-free DNA was conducted by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) for 12 pathogenic <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutations at baseline (BL) and on treatment (OT; Cycle 2, Day 28), and by next-generation sequencing (NGS; 77-gene panel) at BL and end of treatment (EOT). Clinical benefit (CB; complete response + partial response [PR] + stable disease &#8805; 24 weeks) was assessed in pooled pts who received amcenestrant&#8805; 150 mg QD or BID. In tumor tissue, ER, progesterone receptor (PgR), Ki67 and Bcl-2 expression levels over time were assessed by immunohistochemistry; functional ER pathway activity was assessed by gene set variation analysis with RNA-seq data (ER activity score).<br \/>Results: Among pts with data for <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation status at BL (N = 80; ddPCR), 41 pts were WT and 39 pts had at least one <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation, with <i>D538G<\/i> and <i>Y537S<\/i> the most prevalent. CB was observed in pts with both WT (13 pts) and mutated <i>ESR1<\/i> (12 pts) at BL. The most frequent pathogenic mutations detected in pts (N = 79; NGS) at BL were <i>ESR1<\/i> (49%), followed by<i> PI3KCA<\/i> (46%)and <i>TP53<\/i> (33%). In response-evaluable pts with <i>ESR1<\/i> mutational profiling at BL and OT (N = 40; ddPCR), 17 of 19 pts with <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation at BL showed a decrease in <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation allele frequency, independently of clinical benefit. Eight pts showed an increase (7\/25 no CB and 1\/15 CB). Among 17 pts with biopsies, pts with ER or PgR -\/low (H-score: 0-3) at BL did not derive benefit from treatment. In the remaining patients with ER high (H-score &#8805; 140), no difference between pts with and without CB was observed in ER, Bcl-2 or ER activity score, while pts with CB had a tendency for lower Ki67.

HS-10352 is a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase &#945;. Preclinical studies have indicated the favorable safety and antitumor activity of HS-10352 in PIK3CA-mutated tumor models.<br \/>Methods: A phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary anti-tumor activity, in patients (pts) with advanced HR+HER2- breast cancer for whom standard therapy was ineffective or unavailable. The rolling six dose-escalation scheme was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Tumor tissues were collected for retrospectively central determination of PIK3CA mutation status.<br \/>Results: Eighteen pts were treated with HS-10352 orally once daily (2 mg n=3; 4 mg n=3; 6 mg n=6; 8 mg n=6). All patients were HR+HER2- female breast cancer with visceral metastases after a median number of 3 prior systemic therapies for advanced disease. The median treatment duration was 111.5 days (range: 13~388). Dose limiting toxicities occurred in 2 pts at 8 mg (2 Grade 3 hyperglycemia). The MTD was established as 6 mg. According to the CTCAE 5.0, the most common (&#8805; 30%) treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were hyperglycemia (88.9%, n=16), weight decreased (61.1%, n=11), insulin C-peptide increased and diarrhea (33.3% each, n=6). Grade 3-4 TRAEs were hyperglycemia (8 mg, n=2), weight decreased (6 mg, n=2), fatigue (8 mg, n=1), vision blurred (8 mg, n=1), hyperkalemia (8 mg, n=1) and hypocalcemia (8 mg, n=1). Hyperglycemia was generally manageable with oral anti-hyperglycemic medications (13\/16). Treatment-related rash were mild (22.2%, grade 1: n=2; grade 2: n=2). The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) for all patients (n=18) were 27.8% and 55.6% respectively. For 6 pts with PIK3CA mutation, ORR was 50.0% (confirmed partial response [PR] in 3 pts at 6 mg) and DCR was 100.0% (6 mg, n=4; 8 mg, n=2), and the 9-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 66.7% (95% CI: 28.9%~100.0%). Of 4 pts with PIK3CA mutation at potentially recommended phase 2 dose of 6 mg, three pts (75.0%) achieved confirmed PR and 1 patient (25.0%) had stable disease (PFS &#8805; 7.4m). Plasma exposure of HS-10352 increased proportionally following single dose. The mean plasma half-life of HS-10352 was 11~15 hours.<br \/>Conclusions: HS-10352 showed a manageable safety profile and favorable PK properties. The promising antitumor activity was observed in patients with HR+HER2- advanced breast cancer harboring PIK3CA mutation.

We evaluated the safety and tolerability and determined the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FCN-159, a selective MEK1\/2 inhibitor, in patients with <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant advanced melanoma.<br \/>Methods: This single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1A study in China (NCT03932253) enrolled patients with unresectable stage III\/IV melanoma harboring <i>NRAS<\/i> mutations. Patients received FCN-159 in doses escalating from 0.2 mg until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Oral FCN-159 was given once in the single-dose period and once daily (QD) in 28-day cycles in the continuous-dose period. The primary endpoint was the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).<br \/>Results: As of September 16, 2021, 33 patients were enrolled and received 0.2-15 mg FCN-159. All patients had received systemic treatments. One DLT event (grade 3 folliculitis) occurred in the 15 mg group, and no DLT occurred at other dose levels; MTD was defined as 15 mg QD. Grade &#8805;3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) deemed related to FCN-159 were reported in 5 (15.2%) patients across dose levels; stomatitis (2; 6.1%) was the most common. No FCN-159-related TEAEs were serious or led to treatment discontinuation. Among 21 patients assigned to doses &#8805;6 mg, 4 had investigator-confirmed objective responses (objective response rate, 19.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4-41.9); all were partial responses (Table). Median DOR was 4.8 months (95% CI, 2.8-NE). Seven patients had SD (CBR, 52.4%; 95% CI, 29.8-74.3). Median progression-free survival was 3.8 months (95% CI, 1.8-5.6).

QL1706 is a novel dual immune checkpoint blockade containing a mixture of anti-PD-1 IgG4 and anti-CTLA4 IgG1 antibodies produced by a single cell line. Here we reported the pooled data of the phase 1a\/b trial.<br \/>Methods: In the phase 1a dose escalation and expansion study (NCT04296994), dose escalation involved six levels (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 mg\/kg, intravenously q3w) using an accelerated 3+3 design. The dose expansion cohorts received selected doses. In phase 1b (NCT05171790), patients with advanced solid tumors were given intravenous QL1706 5.0 mg\/kg q3w according to the data in phase 1a. The primary objectives were to define the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of QL1706 in phase 1a, and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy in phase 1b.<br \/>Results: As of Sept 30, 2021, totally 518 patients with multiple types of advanced cancer (99 in phase 1a and 419 in phase 1b) were enrolled, including lung cancer (175 [33.8%]), nasopharyngeal cancer (134 [25.9%]), cervical cancer (58 [11.2%]), liver cancer (34 [6.6%]), colorectal cancer (27 [5.2%]), and kidney cancer (18 [3.5%]), etc. 494 [95.4%] were previously treated, and 182 (35.1%) received previous immunotherapy. Two patients at 10 mg\/kg suffered dose-limiting toxicity. The RP2D of QL1706 was defined as 5.0 mg\/kg. After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were observed in 374 patients (72.2%). 70 (13.5%) experienced grade &#8805;3 TRAEs. The most common TRAEs were rash (91 [17.6%]), pruritus (65 [12.5%]), hypothyroidism (60 [11.6%]), AST increased (48 [9.3%]), and hyperthyroidism (46 [8.9%]). The TRAEs that led to drug interruption and drug discontinuation were observed in 67 (12.9%) and 31 patients (6.0%), respectively. The immune-related TRAEs and treatment-related serious adverse events were observed in 223 (43.1%) and 59 patients (11.4%), respectively. 79 (16.9%) patients had a confirmed objective response, 237 (50.6%) patients had a confirmed disease control.<br \/>Conclusion: QL1706 had a manageable safety profile. QL1706 still showed promising anti-tumor activity although over one-third of the patients received prior immunotherapy.

MNK phosphorylates eIF4E to promote translation of a subset of mRNAs that encode oncogenically relevant proteins including c-Myc, Cyclin D1 and PD-L1. We conducted a phase 1B study [NCT04261218] of tomivosertib (T), an orally administered inhibitor of MNK, to assess target engagement in metastatic breast cancer tissue and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of co-administration with paclitaxel (P). There are no prior reports of co-administration of a MNK inhibitor with a cytotoxic agent. All patients underwent pre-treatment baseline and on-treatment (day ~7) core biopsy of metastatic disease during the T monotherapy lead-in phase; subsequently patients continued oral T 100mg bid (without or with meal) with the addition of IV P at 80mg\/m2 day 1 and 8 every 21 days. <u>Results:<\/u> We report here interim data for the first 14 patients with MBC refractory to standard treatments.<br \/>Pharmacokinetics: T plasma levels were 21+\/- 40 ng\/ml throughout the day, and were not influenced by infusion of P. Peak P levels following infusion were 600 +\/- 220 ng\/ml and fell to below detection limit by 24 hours post infusion, similar to prior reports for single-agent P.<br \/>Pharmacodynamics: The main endpoint was assessment of T -induced eIF4E phosphorylation in MBC biopsy tissue, estimated by immunostaining with an antibody specific for eIF4E phosphorylated at S209. Phospho-eIF4E staining intensity was generally high in the pre-treatment samples (indicating baseline activation of eIF4E in MBC). In contrast, the on- T biopsies revealed undetectable phopho-eIF4E staining in all patients. These results were confirmed by mass cytometry analysis, which also included a characterization of the immune microenvironment. We performed ribo-seq analysis on 2 mg flash frozen cancer specimens, and this provided preliminary evidence for decreased translation of mRNAs encoding proteins relevant to neoplasia including TMSB4X and MUCL1 on exposure to T. Preliminary analysis of comparison of proteomic data for each patient, comparing baseline and on-drug biopsies, revealed upregulation of proteins involved in fatty acid catabolic processes, consistent with prior experimental work (PMID 32712434).<br \/>Safety and Clinical: Of 14 initial patients, 1 left the study for adverse reaction (nausea), 1 left study at physician&#8217;s discretion, and 5 left the study for progressive disease. There were no indications of increased P toxicity, and T was generally well tolerated in keeping with prior single agent phase I data. Two patients showed a decrease (36% and 45%) in size of metastases, but others showed disease progression, despite evidence for absence of phospho-eIF4E. The results indicate feasibility of a future phase 2 study of the T - P combination.

This phase I clinical trial tests a novel anti-CD19 CAR T cell product in adults with relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) B-cell Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma (B-NHL). The CAR construct is comprised of the short chain variable regions of the anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody FMC63, the TNFRSF19-derived transmembrane domain, the 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and the CD3-zeta signaling domain. CD19 CAR T cells were manufactured utilizing the CliniMACS Prodigy<sup>&#174;<\/sup> T Cell Transduction Process (CD3\/CD28 TransAct<sup>&#8482;<\/sup> reagent) allowing for highly automated production, with IL-7 and IL-15 used for T cell expansion for 8-12 days. To date, 7 patients have been treated with an average dose of 1.2 &#177; 0.2 x 10<sup>8<\/sup> CAR T cells. The histology includes marginal zone lymphoma (n=1), follicular lymphoma Grade IIIA (n=1), transformed lymphoma (n=3), follicular lymphoma low grade (n=2), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=1). One patient required a second apheresis due to poor cell expansion. Despite heterogeneity in disease subtype and leukapheresis product quality, CAR T production and expansion have been consistent with final transduction efficiencies between 14-45%, cell viability between 88-91%, and an overall average yield of 3.2 &#177; 0.3 x 10<sup>9<\/sup> cells before harvest, allowing for product banking. No safety-related out of specifications (OOS) events have occurred, however, 2 patients had OOS product infused due to low transduction efficiency (both at 14% rather than the &#8805; 20% release criteria). Two patients experienced Grade 2 CRS, 1 patient experienced Grade 2 neurotoxicity; otherwise, no new safety signals were detected. Disease response was assessed on Days 90, 180, 270, and 360 post-infusion. The assessments were based on 2014 Lugano criteria. Even with 2 OOS products, Day 90 scans showed a complete metabolic remission (CMR) in 6 evaluable patients to date. Of the 6 patients with CMR, 1 patient progressed at Day 180 and the others remain in remission (median f\/u = 12 months). Flow cytometry was utilized to measure CAR T cell peak expansion and persistence in 5 patients. Peak CAR T cell expansion (2.9-44.4% of CD3 cells) ranged from Day 5 to 15. Cell persistence was detected for the 5 patients through at least Day 180. ddPCR is currently in development to perform persistence testing in parallel. Additionally, cytokine concentrations including INF&#947;, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL1&#946;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF&#945; were evaluated over the first 30 days. Overall, 7 patients diagnosed with 5 different B-NHL subtypes have been treated with the CD19 CAR T cell product. Manufacturing was successful for all patients with no safety related OOS, and no new post-infusion safety signals detected. To date, 6 out of 7 patients are alive, 5 with CMR and with CD19 CAR T cell persistence through at least 180 days.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e8e57ff-b081-497b-a32c-3a231e4cd824\/@E03B8ZYk\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,CD19,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20370"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manali Kamdar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheri Adams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Bair<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boro Dropulic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathon Gutman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bradley Haverkos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Jordan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Mallo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Russell Marians<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felicia Mast<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsey Murphy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Roth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Seefeldt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Worden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mike Kadan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Xiong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dina Schneider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rimas Orentas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Terry Fry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Verneris<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cellular therapies are emerging treatments with potential utility in epithelial cancers. This proof-of-concept trial investigates an allogeneic cytokine-induced, memory-like (CIML) NK cell infusion with IL-15 superagonist (sa) after lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy in advanced SCCHN.<br \/>Patients and methods: This phase 1 single-center trial enrolled patients (pts) with R\/M SCCHN regardless of human papillomavirus (HPV) status who had prior platinum and immunotherapy. Pts received LD fludarabine (25 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/kg) on days -6 to -2 prior to haploidentical CIML NK cell infusion on day 0 (5-10 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> viable cells\/kg=dose level 0) followed by N-803 (IL-15sa, 15 mcg\/kg subcutaneously) starting on day +1 every 21-days for 4-doses. Part 1 treated 3 pts at dose level 0; &#60;2 DLTs triggered an additional 3 pts. Part 2 will treat an additional 6 pts with lead-in ipilimumab (day -7). Primary objective: safety, maximum tolerated dose of CIML NK cells. Secondary objectives: objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and phenotypic expansion and function of adoptively transferred NK cells.<br \/>Results: From 9\/8\/20 to 9\/7\/21, 6 pts enrolled to Part 1. One DLT was observed at dose level 0. Among 6 pts, median age: 59; 5\/6 (83%) were men; 5\/6 (83%) had oropharyngeal primaries (4 HPV+) with a median 6 prior lines of therapy for R\/M disease (range: 4-8). R\/M disease sites: lung, bone, skin, liver. 5\/6 (83%) had offspring donors. Grade (G) 3-4 hematologic adverse events were common (6\/6, 100%). One patient died of G5 febrile neutropenia and infection. Median days hospitalized: 14 (range: 9-37). Mild cytokine release syndrome was observed in 5\/6 (83%) (median peak ferritin: 2248, CRP: 168); 3\/5 required anti-IL6 therapy; no neurotoxicity was noted. There were no dose adjustments or discontinuation of therapy. One (17%) partial response (PR) was observed lasting 6.5 months; 4 (67%) pts had stable disease (SD), and 1 (17%) had progression. Tumor regression was observed in 3\/6 (50%) pts at day +30. At a median follow-up of 9.5 months, median PFS: 3.4 months (95%CI 2.6-6.5); median OS: 4.7 months (95%CI 3.4-11.8). CIML NK cells showed large expansion in the peripheral blood (PB) at day +7 in all pts; mean increase: 66% (6-fold; standard deviation [SD] 10.5), to constitute 80% (SD 12.1) of PB lymphocytes. In pts with tumor regression at day +30 compared to those without, the % of PB NK cells remained high at day +28 (mean: 78 vs. 11%). PB NK cells remained &#62;50% at day +42 in the pt with a PR.<br \/>Conclusion: Allogeneic CIML NK cells can induce tumor regression associated with persistent CIML NK cell expansion among advanced SCCHN pts. In Part 1 we demonstrate safety and feasibility with the expected risks of LD conditioning. These findings have important implications for the development of cellular therapies in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e88037e9-547d-4816-a97f-ef873e9800ea\/@E03B8ZYk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Natural killer cells,Immuno-oncology,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20604"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Glenn J.

We sought to determine the safety, recommended dose of tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, and biological correlates of tumor shrinkage in patients with GN-refractory MPC.<br \/>Methods: This phase 1, dose finding trial was conducted following preclinical study of IL-6 signaling blockade in genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer (pGEMM) and patients-derived CAF, enrolled 10 patients with MPC that had progressed after GN. During the dose-finding part to determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), patients initially received TCZ 8 mg\/kg on Day 1 and nab-paclitaxel 100 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> + gemcitabine 750 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on Days 2, 9, and 16. The subsequent dose-expansion part used the TCZ dose identified in the dose-finding study. Before Cycle 1 and at the end of Cycle 1, biopsy of liver metastasis was performed 3 to 5 hours after levofloxacin (LVXF) administration to measure LVFX infiltration in tumor using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI).<br \/>Results: In pGEMM tumor, mouse IL-6 receptor antibody plus GN led pathological response. The growth of CAFs from patients with pancreatic cancer was inhibited by TCZ. In this phase I study, no DLTs occurred and the recommended dosage of TCZ was determined to be 8 mg\/kg. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 80% of patients (Grade &#8805;3 in 60%) with decreased neutrophil count (n=5, 7 events) being the most common TEAE. Disease control rate was 80&#183;0% (95%CI: 44&#183;4-97&#183;5) and tumor reduction during cycle 1 was observed in 4 patients who were defined as responder. In paired-biopsied samples, decrease of phosphorylated (p) STAT3 expression in tumor was observed in 7 of 8 patients (88%). Responder-related biological activities were increase of cleaved PARP expression of tumor nuclei (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01), decrease of proliferative CAF (<i>P<\/i> = 0.08), and increase of LVFX infiltration in tumor (<i>P<\/i> = 0.04). Decrease of pSTAT3 expression (<i>P<\/i> = 0.02) was favor to increase of LVFX infiltration against increase of gamma-H2AX, an index of gemcitabine exposure (<i>P<\/i> = 0.20).<br \/>Conclusion: TCZ+GN-rechallenge had a manageable safety profile and showed preliminary activity via inhibition of CAF and gain of intratumoral drug infiltration in MPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/808f58f7-9b86-430f-8cf4-3364df9e60bb\/@E03B8ZYk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tocilizumab,Interleukin-6,Cancer associated fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21063"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shuichi Mitsunaga<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masafumi Ikeda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazunori Aoki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyoko Yamaguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noriaki Sawada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Etsuko Fujii<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masanobu Nishidate<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Fujitomo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideaki Mizuno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoko Kayukawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atsuhiko Kato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mayu Makikawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Imaoka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitsuhito Sasaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuo Watanabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroyuki Tsunoda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimio Terao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atsushi Ochiai<\/i><\/presenter>.

We previously reported safety data from a phase Ib, open-label study of intravenous pelareorep with GM-CSF alongside standard chemoradiotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma and confirmed that the combination is tolerable. Following agreement from the relevant ethics authorities we have now completed long term follow up data on all patients treated in the study to investigate whether there is a signal of impact on survival. METHODS: 15 patients with newly diagnosed GBM were treated with GM-CSF 50&#956;g subcutaneously on days 1-3 and pelareorep on days 4-5 in weeks 1 and 4 of chemoradiotherapy, and subsequently in week 1 of each adjuvant temozolomide course: 7 patients received 1x10<sup>10<\/sup>TCID<sub>50 <\/sub>(dose level 1); 8 received 3x10<sup>10<\/sup>TCID<sub>50 <\/sub>(dose level 2). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of pelareorep and GM-CSF with standard chemoradiotherapy. Following end of study patients were followed up as per institutional practice. Ethical approval was granted to collect survival data in all patients who survived beyond study closure up to June 2021.<br \/>Results: We showed that using intravenous pelareorep with GM-CSF alongside standard chemoradiotherapy in patients with GBM was tolerable with 87% of patients completing treatment as planned. Survival data analysis showed that median OS was 12.6 months for patients in dose level 1 and 16.1 months in dose level 2, giving median OS for all patients 13.1 months. It was notable however that a small number of patients survived beyond 24 months. The 24-month survival estimate for all patients was 33%, 16.7% for dose level 1 and 50% for dose level 2. One patient in dose level 2 remains alive at 42 months.<br \/>Conclusion: We previously reported that intravenous delivery of pelareorep with standard chemoradiotherapy is tolerable in newly diagnosed GBM. Although based on small numbers, these long-term follow up data suggest that this may be an active combination in a subset of GBM patients and further randomized studies are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/04f48074-5a00-47f5-82c9-c841646fad19\/@E03B8ZYk\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Glioblastoma,Phase I,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21402"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susan C.

ATP128, based on the KISIMA platform, is a single chimeric fusion protein, composed of 3 elements essential to generate potent antitumoral cellular immunity: a proprietary cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) for antigen delivery, a proprietary Toll-like receptor (TLR)-peptide agonist with self-adjuvant properties and a modulable multi-antigenic domain (Mad), where the Mad for CRC includes 3 antigens: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Survivin, Achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (ASCL2). VSV-GP128 is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) carrying the glycoprotein (GP) of a non-neurotropic strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) instead of the native VSV-GP. The GP of the LCMV abrogates neurotoxicity. As viral vector, VSV-GP128 expresses a Mad with identical sequence to ATP128 integrated in a linear, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. Preclinical data have shown that priming with KISIMA vaccine followed by VSV-GP boost induced a large pool of polyfunctional and persistent antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in the periphery as well as within the tumor in several tumor models. Combining heterologous vaccination with a PD-1 inhibitor further improved its therapeutic efficacy (Das et al., Nature Communication 2021).<br \/>Methods: KISIMA-01 (NCT04046445) is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1b umbrella trial to investigate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the heterologous prime-boost vaccine AT128\/VSV-GP128 in combination with the anti-PD1 ezabenlimab in patients with stage IV MSS CRC. Two different patient cohorts are investigated: 1) maintenance setting (during a chemotherapy free period) after a minimum of 4 months of 1st line standard chemotherapy with clinical benefit (defined as PR or SD) (n=30); 2) resectable liver-limited disease (n=15). ATP128 is given subcutaneously on day 1 (prime); VSV-GP128 is administered intravenously on day 15 as the heterologous boost. ATP128 is again administered on day 29 (injection 3) and then every 4 weeks for the last 3 immunizations. Ezabenlimab is administered every 3 weeks starting with the first ATP128 administration. Blood and tissue samples are collected before, during and after ATP128\/VSV-GP128 treatment to monitor the induction of a tumor associated antigen-specific immune response and immune-related changes. Immunogenicity will be analyzed in the peripheral blood using ELISpot, and in the tumor microenvironment by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Clearance of ctDNA is analyzed as an exploratory endpoint. The heterologous prime-boost cohorts (ATP128\/VSV-GP128) of the KISIMA-01 trial are recruiting in the US, Switzerland and Belgium.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,Oncolytic virus,Phase I,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21472"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Heinz-Josef Lenz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thibaud Koessler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Oberstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Van Cutsem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunnie Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ralph Fritsch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hans Prenen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Morse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Delphine Gani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madiha Derouazi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Bogenrieder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Kopetz<\/i><\/presenter>.

The characteristics of potential responders to such treatments and the molecular underlying events are not known. <b>Methods<\/b> We have conducted a phase I, investigator-initiated single-center study (MK3457-223), to examine the safety of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab for stage I-II resectable NSCLC and to determine the recommended phase II dose\/schedule (RP2D\/S). FFPE biopsies and surgical specimens were subjected to correlative studies. NanoString&#8217;s GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) analysis was conducted on pre-treatment samples and post-treatment responder samples. Protein (72 proteins) and mRNA expression data (73 genes) analysis was conducted on regions of interest (ROIs), defined as mostly CD8 positive or mostly pan-cytokeratin positive (presumed cancer cells). Pathology assessment was done on the surgical specimen to identify major pathologic response (MPR; <b>&#8804;<\/b>10% remaining viable cells). Statistical analysis was done to compare responders (MPR+) to non-responders (MPR-) by Mann Whitney with false discovery rate correction. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted on post-treatment samples. <b>Results<\/b> Twenty-six patients initiated treatment on the study. Two patients (8%, 95% C.I 0-18%) had adverse events that precluded surgery, 1 patient refused surgery after treatment. 7 patients (27%, 95% C.I 10-44%) achieved a major pathologic response (MPR; responders), 3 patients (12%, 95% C.I 0-24%) achieved complete pathologic response. Responders had a longer interval from treatment to surgery (43 days vs. 36 days, univariate analysis, p-value 0.043). RP2D\/S was determined as 2 treatments of 200mg pembrolizumab at 3 week interval, followed by surgery at least 2 weeks later. The expression of several proteins and genes differed between responders and non-responders. Pre-treatment, CD20 protein was the most differentially expressed protein both in in CD8+ (4.7 fold, p=0.002) and in cancer cells (4.8 fold, p=0.001) ROIs, in both cases higher in the responders compared to the non-responders. Comparing pre to post-treatment expression in responding tumors, the protein found to be upregulated to the highest extent following pembrolizumab treatment was CD20 protein (6.2-fold, p=0.001), as was its encoding gene, MS4A1 (2.4-fold, p=0.006). CD20 IHC of post-treatment samples demonstrated tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) to be more prevalent in responders compared to non-responders (3.2-fold, p&#60;0.05). <b>Conclusions<\/b> Longer interval from treatment to surgery was associated with higher rate of MPR. Presence of tumor-infiltrating B-cells and evolvement of TLSs was strongly correlated with pathologic response to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in early stage NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e0bbef90-c146-40e4-819b-939ddb20b01c\/@E03B8ZYk\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,B cells,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21763"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jair Bar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Kamer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oranit Zadok<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Damien Urban<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Perelman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilanit Redinsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aliza Ackerstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sameh Daher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Efrat Ofek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amir Onn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nona Zeitlin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alon Ben-Nun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ran Kremer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inbal Daniel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yossef Glantzspiegel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irit Gat-Viks<\/i><\/presenter>.
