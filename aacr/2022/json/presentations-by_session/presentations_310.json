[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a deadly disease and patients often suffer from recurrent disease. Biologic mechanisms of recurrence are unclear. Epigenetic mechanisms, like DNA methylation, may be operant. SCLC is rarely resected; therefore, the SCLC methylome is understudied due to scarce tumor tissue.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this study, we examined the pre-treatment methylome of 72 SCLC patients at our institution through cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq) on plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and on sheared genomic DNA from paired peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) (n = 72) to increase tumor signal specificity. cfMeDIP-seq was also performed on an independent cohort of healthy non-cancer controls (n = 20) and on tumors from circulating tumor cell-derived xenograft (CDX) models (n = 12 CDXs of 72 patients). cfMeDIP-seq libraries were sequenced at a depth of 100 million reads, paired-end, on the NovaSeq 6000. For all bioinformatic analyses, chromosomes 1-22 were binned into 300-bp windows (n = 9.6e6 genome-wide windows); reads from cfMeDIP-seq were tallied per bin. To filter out noise from non-tumor cells, ENCODE blacklist regions (n = 1e6 windows) were removed and CG-rich (&#62;5 CGs per window), PBL-associated windows with MeDEStrand-converted beta-values &#60; 0.2 were kept (n = 190,769 windows). Subsequent cfDNA analyses were performed using these 190,769 windows.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 33 (45.8%) and 39 (54.2%) of the 72 patients had limited-stage (LS) and extensive-stage (ES) SCLC, respectively. Most were current or former smokers (65\/72, 90.3%). Using filtered windows (n = 190,769), methylated cfDNA from SCLC were distinguished from healthy controls: SCLC cfDNA was enriched for hypermethylated CpG islands and shore regions, whereas controls had more methylated open-sea regions. SCLC cohort by consensus clustering of the top 5000 most variant windows revealed two distinct cfDNA methylation patterns. Cluster A (9 ES, 22 LS) and Cluster B (33 ES, 11 LS) were significantly different by stage (X<sup>2<\/sup>(1) = 13.79, p &#60; 0.001). There was no significant difference in sex (p = 0.81). Patients in Cluster A had a lower concentration of cfDNA (median = 7.2ng\/ml) compared to Cluster B (median = 15.9ng\/ml) but not statistically significant (p = 0.33). High concordance between genome-wide methylome profiles was found between paired patient cfDNA and CDX tumor, demonstrating that cfDNA is representative of tumor methylation (Pearson's correlation median r = 0.86).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We identified stage-specific methylation patterns in the plasma of SCLC patients using the cfMeDIP-seq assay that may reveal novel epigenetic and biologic mechanisms of SCLC disease progression. Moreover, CDXs recapitulate the methylome of SCLC cell-free patient samples highlighting their utility in future work as representative models for methylome analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ca0f308c-8d0a-4720-a93c-6e380a5959f4\/@u03B8ZBd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating cell-free DNA,DNA methylation,CTC-derived xenograft models,cfMeDIP-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12588"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sami Ul Haq<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Schmid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mansi K.

Early detection of the disease has the potential to improve patient outcomes, therefore, developing an efficient and minimally invasive method for carrying out surveillance has been a clinically relevant effort in recent years. Circulating tumour DNA has garnered interest as a marker for early cancer detection, however, deeper understanding of the underlying biology of ctDNA release is needed in order to maximize its utility in clinical practice. In this project, we aimed to investigate whether a phenotype conductive to ctDNA shedding can be defined in a colorectal cancer cohort, including transcriptomic, genomic and clinical data collected from stage I to stage IV colon cancer patients at Aarhus University Hospital.<br \/>Methods: Transcriptomic data from 102 patients and whole exome sequencing data from 60 patients were analyzed. Differential gene expression and differential pathway enrichment analyses between ctDNA positive and ctDNA negative patients were conducted by performing Student&#8217;s t-test. The resulting p-values were adjusted according to the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The genes in the transcriptomic analyses were assigned to pathways with regard to the MSigDB Hallmark gene sets and pathway enrichment was assessed using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). Using an extended cohort of 537 patients, we performed Wilcoxon&#8217;s signed rank test to investigate the association between tumour size, histological subtypes and ctDNA shedding behavior. Additionally, we modelled the expected ctDNA fraction as a function of birth rate, death rate and tumour mass.<br \/>Results: In colon cancer, ctDNA release is primarily associated with tumour size, molecular subtypes and proliferative transcriptomic signatures. A moderate but significant correlation was observed between the tumour&#8217;s largest diameter and the detected ctDNA fraction. Furthermore, molecular subtypes associated with less aggressive disease tended to shed lower amounts of ctDNA. Notably, we have found that pathways associated with proliferation are enriched in the ctDNA positive subgroup.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that enhanced proliferative capacity in connection with tumour size and molecular subtypes may contribute to a higher ctDNA release rate. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for further investigation of ctDNA shedding dynamics in colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7d2e9278-07f5-4605-a4aa-dd8ca7fcc20b\/@u03B8ZBd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,Colorectal cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12591"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Judit Kisistok<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tenna Vesterman Henriksen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesper Bertram Bramsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Reinert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trine Block Mattesen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolai Juul Birkbak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claus Lindbjerg Andersen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Poziotinib is an oral pan-HER TKI that has been demonstrated to be efficacious in NSCLC patients harboring HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. We assessed serial plasma samples for changes in tumor genotype in both treatment naive and second line patients to evaluate correlation with clinical response.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> For NSCLC patients, HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations identified by tumor tissue based NGS were required for entry into the ZENITH20 study. Plasma samples were collected prior to treatment and at C3D1 (8 weeks post treatment 16mg poziotinib QD). The Guardant360<sup>&#174;<\/sup> 74-gene liquid biopsy assay, which assessed changes in ctDNA and, subsequently, mean variant allele fraction (mVAF), was utilized for analysis of samples. The Guardant360 Response&#8482; Molecular Response (MR) algorithm was calculated as a ratio of mVAF of oncogenic alterations at baseline compared to poziotinib treatment at C3D1.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>23 patients with tumor tissue confirmed NSCLC harboring HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations were studied. 22 of 23 (96%) had baseline plasma samples with detectable ctDNA. 21 of 22 samples had detectable HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations, resulting in a concordance of 95% versus tissue based NGS. The most prevalent HER2 exon 20 insertion alteration was the A775_G776ins YVMA variant, found in 50% of the baseline blood and tumor samples using both methods (100% concordance). 16 of 17 patients had both baseline and C3D1 samples, permitting assessment of temporal response. 15 of the 16 (94%) patients demonstrated a decrease in mVAF at C3D1 compared to the mVAF at baseline. 12 of 15 patients demonstrated an &#62;50% reduction in mVAF at C3D1, with 7 of the 12 patients showing &#62;95% reduction in mVAF at C3D1 with clinical outcomes of 5 PRs, 1 non-CR\/non-PD and 1 SD. Interestingly, 3 of these patients showed complete clearance of ctDNA target HER2 exon 20 insertions<i> <\/i>at the C3D1 timepoint.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Baseline plasma ctDNA genotyping correlated with tumor tissue based NGS in an NSCLC patient population with HER2 mutations. Poziotinib treatment resulted in mVAF reduction, which correlated with clinical response per RECIST1.1. Assessment of longitudinal changes in ctDNA during drug therapy may potentially be used to predict patient response and possibly tumor resistance. Further evaluation in larger cohorts and longer duration of treatment is required to help elucidate the impact of these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/449ba071-caef-4140-b21e-8f56d1c7aa69\/@v03B8ZBe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12593"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arunthi Thiagalingam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sribalaji Lakshmikanthan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allysia J.

However, in pediatric brain cancers, liquid biopsy methods from the blood have been unsuccessful due to a low tumor burden and low number of mutations in coding regions. We hypothesized that a whole genome sequencing (WGS)-derived patient specific mutational signature from a matched tumor-normal WGS can provide a sensitive and specific approach to detect mutations in circulating cell free tumor DNA (ctDNA) and provide blood-based monitoring in pediatric patients with brain tumor.<br \/>Methods: All tumors were analyzed and molecularly subclassified using whole genome DNA methylation profiling and machine learning classifier. Tumor DNA was extracted from pathology tissue and normal germline DNA from the white blood cells, while ctDNA was extracted from 1-2 mL of post-surgery or follow-up plasma samples, WGS was applied to sequence DNA from matched tumor-normal and plasma samples. WGS coverage was 40x for matched tumor-normal DNA and 20x for ctDNA. Using the C2i assay, we derived a personalized mutational pattern for each tumor and used an AI-based error suppression model for quantification and ultra-sensitive detection of ctDNA in plasma samples. A patient-specific personalized genome-wide compendium of somatic mutations was established and ctDNA tested at 1 to 3 available time points during the therapy or surveillance period. An AI-based error suppression model was implemented to filter out the noise in the cell free DNA (cfDNA) while the personalized mutational signature was used to detect the ctDNA in the cfDNA and to amplify the somatic signal contained in it. The ctDNA Tumor Fraction (TF) was compared to the clinical status and MR-based imaging.<br \/>Results: We profiled 7 pediatric brain tumors, including 2 medulloblastomas (one Group 3, one Group 4), 3 pediatric glioblastomas IDH wild-type, 1 ependymoma PFA subtype and one low grade ganglioglioma. Tumor specific signatures were identified and detected in the plasma of 5 patients with clinical disease with a TF range 0.02-0.0005 but not in 2 patients with no tumor at the time of blood collection. In two children with a medulloblastoma and glioblastoma, the decrease of tumor fraction in ctDNA over 2 (TF: 0.002 to 0.0009) and 3 time points (TF: 0.0005 to undetectable), respectively, correlated with response to therapy based on imaging.<br \/>Conclusions: Patient-specific WGS tumor signature in ctDNA from blood can be used for sensitive monitoring of children with brain tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bea53206-3579-4d7e-bcfb-4d26a1733dd5\/@v03B8ZBe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Circulating cell-free DNA,Medulloblastoma,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12594"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ivy Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristyn Galbraith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guisheng Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robyn Borsuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joyce Varkey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharon Gardner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Allen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Harter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Wisoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eveline T.

Most ctDNA-based MRD assays require <i>a<\/i> <i>priori<\/i> knowledge of genomic alterations from tumor tissue to achieve acceptable sensitivity and specificity. However, tissue availability may be limited in some patients with breast cancer, particularly following neoadjuvant therapy. Here we report results of a pilot study evaluating a plasma-only multiomic ctDNA MRD assay and its association with breast cancer recurrence.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>47 plasma samples from 38 patients with early-stage breast cancer were collected through the BRandO BiO Registry at 12- or 36-months post-diagnosis and\/or at the time of clinical recurrence. BRandO BiO is a multi-center regional registry with longitudinal biobanking from patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer at 20 affiliated network hospitals in Germany. The presence of ctDNA was evaluated using the Guardant Reveal multi-cancer assay, a next generation sequencing panel covering ~500 genes and ~4Mb of epigenomic regions that undergo differential methylation in multiple solid tumor types. The presence\/absence of ctDNA is determined by a custom bioinformatics classifier that identifies tumor-derived somatic variants and methylation profiles specific to individual cancer types without the need for tumor tissue or peripheral blood mononuclear cell analysis. Samples were analyzed blinded to recurrence status.Results: 20 patients were confirmed to have clinical recurrence (7 local, 13 distant). ctDNA was detected at or prior to distant recurrence in 11\/13 (85%) patients and in 1\/7 (14%) patients with local recurrence. Five patients with distant recurrence had a sample available that was collected prior to distant recurrence; ctDNA was detected in 4\/5 with a 3.8-18.6 month lead time. Among 15 ctDNA+ samples, 5 were positive for both methylation and somatic variant calls, 1 by somatic variants only, and 9 by methylation only. Somatic mutations were identified in <i>AKT, RB1, KRAS, PIK3CA, ERBB2, MAP3K1, GATA3<\/i>, and <i>ESR1<\/i>. The <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation occurred in a patient with endocrine therapy resistance, confirming the ability of the assay to identify acquired treatment resistance mutations. ctDNA was not detected in samples from the 14 patients who had no confirmed clinical recurrence (100% specificity).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of MRD detection in breast cancer using a plasma-only multiomic ctDNA-based approach. The Guardant Reveal assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity to detect distant breast cancer recurrence. Larger studies in this population are ongoing to further validate the clinical performance of the assay and demonstrate its applications in the management of early-stage breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f347b9f5-af94-41c6-aaa7-c029736b25bd\/@v03B8ZBe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Molecular markers,Breast cancer,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12596"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wolfgang Janni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jens Huober<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatjana Braun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Volkmar Müller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelina Fink<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amelie De Gregorio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brigitte Rack<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas W.

The development of assays that are sensitive, specific, economical, and non-invasive may lead to the development of further effective screening strategies. Non-invasive liquid biopsy by detection in plasma of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) carrying somatic lung cancer mutations is now routinely used for identifying targeted therapy options in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Recent adaptation of bacterial CRISPR-Cas13a systems with promiscuous ribonuclease activity into reporter assays for the sensitive and economical detection of specific nucleic acid sequences makes an attractive system for ctDNA detection without needing more costly next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We adapted the CRISPR-Cas13a system used in the SHERLOCK detection assay for the detection of common driver mutations (KRAS G12C\/V, EGFR Exon 19 deletion, and EGFR L858R) in NSCLC and tested the assay on a retrospective cohort of 52 NSCLC patients with known mutations (based on tissue NGS) and with plasma obtained prior to or at the time of any surgical resection and a prospective cohort of 71 patients who underwent lung resection with plasma collected at the time of surgical resection.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We designed several CRISPR guide RNAs targeting common EGFR and KRAS oncogenic mutations in NSCLC and were able to generate sensitive CRISPR-Cas13a detection assays against KRAS G12C and G12V, EGFR L858R, and EGFR E746_A750 exon 19 deletion mutations that could identify allele fractions below 1% in reference standards. We then tested plasma of a 52 patient (33 advanced stage IIIB and IV, 19 resectable stage I-IIIA) retrospective cohort with known KRAS and EGFR mutations and matching non-cancer controls using the CRISPR-Cas13a assay as well as with NGS panels (ArcherDx). Using NGS, we were able to confirm ctDNA in 15 samples which we were also able to detect using the CRISPR-Cas13a assay with similar allele frequencies. The CRISPR-Cas13a assay was able to identify ctDNA in 42 out of the 52 retrospective NSCLC samples including 13 out of 19 samples from resectable-stage patients, although the detection rate decreased with earlier stage I and II patients who have a much lower ctDNA level in plasma. We then prospectively collected a cohort of 71 subjects who underwent surgical resection with 38 subjects with lung adenocarcinoma (mostly stage I and II), 11 subjects with benign nodules, and 22 subjects with a different histology malignancy.

Circulating tumor (ct)DNA isolated from liquid biopsy has been shown to have clinical utility as a biomarker in cancer, with ctDNA levels and fragment size used to monitor treatment response.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The aim of this study was to determine the presence of ctDNA in liquid biopsy (plasma and saliva) of HPV+ HNC patients to non-invasively monitor treatment response and disease progression. Blood and saliva samples were collected from 45 HPV+ HNC patients and 14 HPV-negative controls at the McGill University Health Centre before and\/or after surgical resection. Samples were analyzed using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) with primers and probes for HPV16\/HPV18, the most common subtypes of HPV in HNC, accounting for 97% of cases in North America. Analysis was performed for all patients with confirmed follow-up scans and\/or pathology. ctDNA levels were correlated with disease course as determined through imaging (&#62;6 months post-sampling) and pathological examination.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>ctDNA was detectable in 21\/23 (91%) patients prior to treatment and 8\/36 (22%) post treatment. In the two patients who were not positive for ctDNA prior to treatment, tumor tissue was found to be negative for HPV DNA despite being p16-positive by immunohistochemistry. Patients showed shifts in ctDNA fragment length in longitudinal samples following treatment. All post-treatment patients with no detectable ctDNA had no signs of recurrence\/residual disease on follow-up imaging. In contrast, all 8 patients who tested positive for ctDNA post-treatment showed signs of recurrence on follow-up imaging. In our cohort, 14 patients had matched pre- and post-treatment samples and all showed major reductions in ctDNA post treatment compared to pre-treatment, with 12\/14 patients having a complete loss of detectable ctDNA. Concordance between the presence of ctDNA in saliva and plasma was found in 86% of patients. ctDNA was only detected in one analyte in 6 patients (3 in plasma only and 3 in saliva only).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>HPV ctDNA was successfully detected in saliva and blood of patients with HPV-positive HNC, with a sensitivity of 92% for ctDNA prior to treatment, and a sensitivity of 100% when adjusted for tumor HPV status as opposed to p16 staining. The inclusion of both plasma and saliva in analysis increases the sensitivity of assays, with the use of both analytes allowing for the detection of ctDNA in patients with low plasma DNA levels and for patients who did not have salivary ctDNA, potentially due to inability to produce sufficient saliva or tumor location.

We sought to determine whether the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in samples of patients undergoing chemotherapy for advanced leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is associated with objective response or survival. Our cohort consisted of 98 patients treated on the SARC021 trial, an open-label, randomized, phase 3, multicenter trial testing the efficacy of adding evofosfamide to doxorubicin compared to treatment with doxorubicin alone for patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas. Using ultra-low passage whole genome sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA we tested whether detection of ctDNA evaluated prior to the start of therapy and after 2 cycles of chemotherapy were associated with treatment response and outcome. Associations between detection of ctDNA and pathological measures of disease burden were evaluated. Kaplan Meier curves were used to estimate survival in patients with or without detectable ctDNA and the log-rank test was used to estimate the significance of the difference between these two groups. We also tested for an association between disease response, stage and number of metastatic sites with the presence or absence of ctDNA with Fisher&#8217;s exact test and with ctDNA levels by Student t test. We found that ctDNA was detectable by ULP-WGS in 49% of patients prior to treatment and in 24.6% patients after two cycles of chemotherapy. Detection of pre-treatment ctDNA was associated with a lower overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.03 - 2.31; p=0.03) and a lower likelihood of objective response (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.06 - 0.59; p=0.005). After two cycles of chemotherapy, patients who continued to have detectable levels of ctDNA experienced a significantly worse overall survival (HR=1.77; 95% CI: 1 - 3.14; p=0.05) and were unlikely to experience an objective response (OR=0.05; 95% CI: 0 - 0.39; p=0.001). We found that detectable levels of ctDNA prior to the start of treatment was significantly associated with patients who had primary tumors measuring greater than 10 cm (75% versus 28%, respectively; p &#60; 0.001), and had more than 5 sites of metastatic disease (73.9% versus 26.1%, respectively; p &#60; 0.001). Detection of ctDNA is associated with outcome and objective response to chemotherapy in patients with advanced LMS. These results suggest that liquid biopsy assays could be used to inform treatment decisions by recognizing patients who are likely and unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy.Ongoing work focuses on identification of ctDNA features, such as copy-number alterations or changes in ctDNA levels over time, that may also be associated with disease progression or response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fde39996-805c-4ffa-b987-5e04b8ed70fb\/@v03B8ZBe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Response,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12602"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laura Madanat-Harjuoja<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Klega<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yao Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David S.

Assay of HPV copy number in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides a minimally invasive method for detecting and monitoring tumor-derived HPV, with potential for enhancing clinical care. We have evaluated the utility of cfDNA droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) as a method for characterisation and longitudinal monitoring of patients with OPSCC in a prospectively recruited cohort of 104 OPSCC patients. ddPCR assay of cfDNA for five HPV types showed overall 95% concordance with p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR analysis of solid tumor tissue. Longitudinal sampling in 48 HPV+ve patients, with median follow-up of 20 months, strongly predicted patient outcomes. Progression-free survival, stratified respectively by the presence or absence of detectable HPV cfDNA at a median of 13 weeks post-treatment, was 50% and 88% (p=0.001, hazard ratio 10.0 (95% CI 2.1-47.1)). In two patients, greater reliance on sequential HPV measurement would have avoided surgical intervention which ultimately did not confirm disease recurrence. The high concordance of pre-treatment plasma cfDNA-HPV analysis with p16 IHC and HPV-PCR of solid tissue, together with the predictive value and utility of sequentially measured post-treatment cfDNA-HPV copy number, provide a compelling case for the routine use of cfDNA-HPV ddPCR in management of OPSCC and for clinical trials to assess its impact on treatment outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1d59bd65-7636-466a-b93e-89e98f68438e\/@v03B8ZBe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,Liquid biopsies,Human papillomavirus (HPV),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12603"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Martyna Joanna Adamowicz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie J.

Genomic biomarkers that can predict treatment response are urgently needed to facilitate personalized mCRPC treatment. Such biomarkers can be identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS) of tumor biopsies. Blood plasma can serve as a non-invasive liquid tumor biopsy as it contains cell free DNA (cfDNA), a subset of which in cancer patients is tumor-derived (circulating tumor DNA; ctDNA). The biomarker discovery potential of WGS of cfDNA in mCRPC remains largely undescribed, as most WGS studies to date have focused on tissue biopsies. Thus, we here aimed to characterize the genomic tumor landscape of mCRPC using WGS of cfDNA.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We previously performed low-pass WGS (mean coverage: 0.5X) of cfDNA sampled prior to initiation of first-line mCRPC treatment from 143 mCRPC patients (mean ctDNA fraction: 0.15). From these, 10 patients with high (&#62;0.35) ctDNA fractions who received enzalutamide as first-line mCRPC treatment were selected for deeper WGS here. Matched germline DNA from buffy coat (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) was also sequenced. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called with Mutect2 and CaVEMan, indels with Mutect2 and Pindel, copy-number variants (CNVs) with ASCAT, and structural variants (SVs) with BRASS. For the final analysis, we considered only SNVs and indels called by both tools.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We sequenced germline samples to a mean coverage of 25X (range: 19-28X) and cfDNA samples to a mean coverage of 32X (range: 23-43X). We identified a median of 5,241 SNVs\/indels (range: 3,422-48,314) per patient and the mean tumor mutation burden was 1.7 mutations\/Mb. One sample had &#62;9 times more SNVs\/indels than the median, suggesting microsatellite instability. Among the most recurrently mutated genes were <i>LRP1B<\/i> (7\/10 patients), <i>ARSB<\/i> (5\/10 patients), and <i>TP53<\/i> (4\/10 patients). COSMIC mutational signature analysis revealed that the clock-like signatures 1, 5, and 40 were most frequent. In contrast, the hypermutated sample was driven primarily by the defective DNA mismatch repair signatures 15, 26, and 44. CNVs affected a mean of 40.9% of the genome. Common PC CNVs were observed, including gains at chromosome 8 (<i>MYC<\/i>) in 8\/10 patients and losses at chromosome 10 (<i>PTEN<\/i>) in 5\/10 patients. Recurrent focal amplifications (defined as &#62;8 copies in regions &#60;3 Mb) affected chromosome 15q11.2 in 3\/10 patients, chromosome 22q11.21 in 3\/10 patients, and chromosome Xq12, where <i>AR<\/i> is located, in 3\/10 patients. Finally, we identified a median of 241 SVs (range: 92-525) per patient. SVs affecting <i>TMPRSS2 <\/i>were observed in 3\/10 patients.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study highlights that WGS of cfDNA contributes to the identification of genomic aberrations that may serve as potential biomarkers to guide personalized treatment of mCRPC in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b30be2d-8f22-48cb-abcc-ba0a872f79c2\/@v03B8ZBe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Precision medicine,Prostate cancer,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12605"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Simone Weiss<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Lamy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maibritt Nørgaard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Knudsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jørgen B.

Median progression-free survival on erda is 5.5 months and mechanisms of resistance remain poorly characterized. Analysis of ctDNA offers an opportunity to longitudinally and non-invasively assess for mechanisms of resistance.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Plasma was collected from mUC pts on erda at baseline, on-tx, and at disease progression (PD). Clinical characteristics were recorded. Pre-tx tumors were sequenced with MSK-IMPACT and plasma samples with MSK-ACCESS, a cell-free DNA assay sequencing 129 genes with unique molecular indexes to generate &#62;15,000x coverage for detection of mutations to an allele frequency of 0.1%.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Between 8\/2019-9\/2021, 18 pts received erda. Median progression-free survival was 4.2 months, range 1.4-10.8. Tx was discontinued in 14 pts for PD, 3 for toxicity, and 1 death unrelated to erda\/PD. During tx, several pts acquired new alts in ctDNA compared to pre-tx tumor\/ctDNA, most commonly in TP53 (n = 5) and FGFR3 (n = 4) (Table 1). Of 9 newly acquired FGFR2\/3 alts observed in ctDNA on-tx, 3 were hotspots. Several acquired FGFR3 alts have been shown to impact binding of erda to FGFR3 in vitro (Table 1). Of 5 pts with primary refractoriness to erda, 3 had baseline activating alts of signaling downstream or parallel to FGFR, including alts of PIK3CA (n = 1), TSC1 (n = 1), and HER2 (n = 2).

A suitable diagnostic-grade platform is required for detection of tumor-specific mutations with high sensitivity in circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) of cancer patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In an international multicenter study conducted by three laboratories participating in the CANCER-ID consortium, a cohort containing 177 cell-free plasma samples at baseline, follow-up or disease progression derived from 72 patients treated for advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), relevant mutations were tested using the UltraSEEK&#174; Lung Panel on the MassARRAY&#174; System covering 73 hotspot mutations in <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>KRAS,<\/i> <i>BRAF<\/i>, <i>ERBB2<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA<\/i>, and compared against mutation-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and tumor tissue next-generation sequencing (NGS) performed in routine diagnostics. Variant detection accuracy at primary diagnosis and during disease progression, and ctDNA dynamics as a marker of treatment efficacy were analyzed.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The UltraSEEK&#174; Lung Panel revealed an overall detection rate of 87.2% irrespective of ccfDNA input, and a specificity of &#62;99.5% using the reference material. When comparing the 131 variants identified in the patient-derived cell-free plasma using UltraSEEK&#174; with mutation-specific ddPCR analyses, a concordance of 90% was found. The 77 diagnostically or clinically relevant variants identified in 66 pretreatment tumor tissue showed an overall concordance with UltraSEEK&#174; of 73% at baseline with a false-negative rate of 3%. When restricting to therapeutically targetable mutations, the concordance elevated to 85%. A decrease in ctDNA levels at 4-6 weeks after start of treatment detected with UltraSEEK&#174; correlated with a prolonged median PFS (46 vs 11 weeks; <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05) and OS (145 vs 39 weeks; <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001).

Venetoclax is a potent inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 with evidence in MM that t(11;14) and high <i>BCL2<\/i> expression confers greater sensitivity to venetoclax. BM biopsy is required for fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) detection of t(11;14) and the evaluation of MM cell <i>BCL2<\/i> expression, with success being entirely dependent on the quality of the BM sample procured. We hypothesised that a liquid biopsy strategy to enable interrogation of cell-free circulating tumour (ct)DNA and extra-cellular (ex)RNA would represent a more practical and less invasive alternative strategy to BM biopsy for the detection of t(11;14) and the determination of MM cell <i>BCL2<\/i> expression, respectively.<b><\/b><b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Blood and BM were obtained from 24 FISH characterised MM patients - normal karyotype (n=9), t(11;14) (n=11) and t(4;14) (n=4). Plasma derived ctDNA and exRNA was extracted utilising the QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit and matched PBMC DNA was obtained for germ line controls. BM CD138+ MM cells for DNA and RNA extraction were selected with Miltenyi Biotec CD138 microbeads. A low density custom panel of unique capture probes (SSEL XT HS2, SureSelect Custom Tier 2, Agilent Technology), spanning approximately 10% of the <i>CCND1<\/i> and <i>IGH<\/i> loci involved in t(11;14), was used for sequencing with approximately 5 million reads per sample with adapter sequences trimmed from the reads and aligned to the hg38 using bwa mem algorithm. Structural variant caller, Lumpy was used for identifying translocations, with low confidence reads excluded with a defined Z-score threshold. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for <i>BCL2<\/i> was performed on exRNA.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The low-density capture seq identified t(11;14) in 6 of 11 (55%) of the CD138+ BM samples, but not in paired germ-line samples nor in the non-t(11;14) cohort BM samples. Interrogation of ctDNA identified t(11;14) in 1 of 11 samples but also in ctDNA from a patient labelled as being t(4;14) positive raising questions about the validity of the FISH attribution. We are now utilising a modification of the assay using ultra-high density capture probes with coverage approaching 100% of the <i>IGH<\/i> region and higher ctDNA input to detect translocations involving the <i>IGH<\/i> region on chromosome 14 with any partner chromosome, including translocations undetectable by FISH. <i>BCL2<\/i> exRNA transcripts were detected in all patients with a range of 2-120 copies\/ml of plasma with 79% of patients classified as &#8216;high&#8217; <i>BCL2<\/i> expression (&#62;40 copies\/ml of plasma) compared to 59% of the matched CD138+ BM samples.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We provide proof-of-concept of the potential of ctDNA and exRNA for t(11;14) detection and ddPCR quantitation of <i>BCL2<\/i> expression, respectively, providing a rationale for further exploration of ctDNA and exRNA liquid biopsy testing as a strategy for identifying patients with t(11;14) and\/or high <i>BCL2<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/024342e8-d037-4756-b6b4-6146d4659b67\/@w03B8ZBf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Translocation,Bcl-2 protein family,Circulating cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12614"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew Spencer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sridurga Mithraprabhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaynish Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kawa Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley George<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Hader<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiffany Khong<\/i><\/presenter>.

Several studies have demonstrated the potential of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect genomic alterations at high accuracy compared with tissue analysis. However, no studies have comprehensively evaluated differences between tissue and ctDNA by using a large panel in the same cohort.<br \/><b><i>Methods<\/i><\/b>: Genomic analysis was performed for each patient by using the Foundation One Liquid CDx Assay and the Foundation One CDx Assay (324 genes, tumor mutational burden [TMB], microsatellite instability). Each individual genomic report was reviewed and discussed weekly by a multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB). Actionable targets were defined by the MTB according to the existing level of evidence (ESCAT tiers) and molecular-based treatment suggestions were proposed where possible.<br \/><b><i>Results: <\/i><\/b>Between Dec 2020 and Nov 2021, 1021 patients (median age: 62 years) with advanced cancer underwent both tissue and ctDNA NGS.

Median time elapsed between request and assay results was 12 days for ctDNA and 46 days for tissue. Testing failure was 15% for tissue and 3.9% for ctDNA. Overall, 824 (81%) patients had evaluable results for both tissue and liquid. Total number of cancer-related alterations and variants of unknown significance were 4704 and 11673 vs 4645 and 7481 for ctDNA and tissue, respectively. Proportion of patients with a higher number of cancer alterations identified in ctDNA compared with tissue increased in parallel with the time elapsed between the tissue and ctDNA sampling (45% vs 33% for a delay &#62; 26 months or &#60; 8 months). MSI and TMB status were concordant for 71% and 64% of patients, respectively. MSI status was evaluable for 97% of patients through ctDNA vs 90% through tissue. Number of actionable alterations was similar in 346 (42%) of cases, whereas it was higher in tissue for 289 (35%) and in liquid for 189 (23%) patients. ctDNA profiling allowed the identification of an ESCAT I\/II or III or IV alteration not present in tissue for 74 (9%), 113 (14%) and 52 (6%) patients, respectively.

NLR (neutrophil count divided by lymphocyte count), ALP, LDH, and albumin were obtained from blood collected contemporaneous with mCRPC biopsies. Clinical data were retrospectively collected. Negative binomial regression determined the association between leucocyte densities and log-transformed NLR. Modified Poisson regression estimated the risk ratio (RR) for the presence of PMN-MDSCs in relation to higher NLR (&#62;3). OS was analysed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier.

This fluid is accessible via the cornea which enables use of AH as a liquid biopsy for intraocular disease. Retinoblastoma (Rb), an intraocular cancer in children, is unique in that direct tumor biopsy is prohibited, thus liquid biopsy has great clinical potential. cfDNA in the AH as a biomarker for Rb patients has been investigated and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are detectable in the AH from adults. However, AH EVs in Rb have previously never been explored. We know very little about the heterogeneity of AH EV populations in ocular cancers.<br \/>Materials and Methods: 27 AH samples from 19 patients from 13 tumor-free eyes and 11 Rb eyes were collected. Rb eyes were further divided into treatment-na&#239;ve (Rb_Tn) and treatment-active (Rb_Tx) subgroups. Unprocessed AH samples were subjected to Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) (Nanosight NS300) for size distribution and concentration, and to Single Particle-Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor (SP-IRIS) (Exoview R100) for fluorescent-based immunophenotyping of EV marker expression (CD63, CD81, and CD9).<br \/>Results: NTA demonstrated the concentration of AH EVs is 3.11 x 10<sup>9<\/sup>-1.38 x 10<sup>10<\/sup> vesicles\/mL; majority sized 76.8-103 nm. Study group comparisons showed that non-tumor containing eyes had a smaller nanoparticle mean size compared to Rb containing eyes (P = 0.002). More EVs were significantly detected in Rb_Tn containing eyes compared to Rb_Tx containing eyes (P = 0.022), suggesting the possible presence of tumor-derived EVs in Rb_Tn which were subsequently eliminated by treatment. SP-IRIS revealed distinct patterns of tetraspanin expression of AH small EVs (sEVs). Mono-CD63+ EVs were identified to be the most dominant sEV subpopulation from AH across non-tumor and Rb_Tx eyes. However, more diverse sEV subpopulation profile was detected in Rb_Tn AH samples. Significantly lower percentage of mono-CD63+ EVs could be determined in Rb_Tn eyes compared to Rb_Tx eyes (70.3% vs. 96.1%, P = 0.001). A significant accumulation of CD9\/CD63 (4.3% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.035), CD63\/CD81 (20.7% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.012) and CD9\/CD63\/CD81 (4.8% vs. 0.8%, P = 0.022) subpopulations in Rb_Tn was also observed. An enriched mono-CD63+ sEV subpopulation identified in AH indicates this is a potential AH-specific biomarker. In the setting of Rb there was a more heterogeneous population of sEVs which normalized with treatment.<br \/>Conclusions: Small EVs are readily detectable in unprocessed AH with a dominant mono-CD63+ subpopulation in AH regardless of pediatric eye disease states. Tetraspanin colocalization analysis indicates the clearance of retinoblastoma-derived EV heterogeneity by chemotherapy. These novel finding suggests a potential clinical application of measurement of sEV subpopulations in AH samples to monitor response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1041008a-3784-4701-aedf-1aa9aee3ace1\/@w03B8ZBf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Extracellular vesicles,Pediatric cancers,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12827"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chen-Ching Peng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deborah Im<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shreya Sirivolu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bibiana Reiser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Nagiel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo Neviani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liya Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse L.

Due to their heterogeneity, different isolation methods may enrich distinct exosome cargos generating different omic profiles. In this study, we evaluated the effects of plasma exosome isolation methods on detectable multiomic profiles in cancer patients and healthy controls.<br \/>Methods: Plasma exosomes were isolated from prostate cancer patients (PC; N = 11), lung cancer patients (LC; N = 13), and matched healthy controls (HC; N = 10) using three methods [SBI (size exclusion), Takara (lectin binding), and Wako (Tim4 binding)]. Mass spectrometry was performed to determine exosome lipidome and metabolome profiles. To evaluate group-specific exosome enrichment, we developed an exosome enrichment index (EEI) by summing 50 smallest p-values after log2 transformation. Higher EEI indicates prefrential capture of significant exosome cargos from patients over controls.<br \/>Results: Our data showed that the SBI method generated the most identified lipids from exosome across all groups (LC = 935, PC = 939, and HC = 943), followed by Takara (245, 245 and 245) and Wako (205, 208 and 213). Compared to controls, LC patients had 31 higher and 5 lower lipid levels (FDR &#60; 0.1) using the SBI and 3 higher and 1 lower level (FDR &#60; 0.1) using Takara. We did not observe any differences between cancer and normal samples using Wako. The most detectable known metabolites were found in exosomes from SBI (LC = 188, PC = 191, and HC = 100), followed by Wako (LC = 107, PC = 107, and HC = 107) and Takara (LC = 99, PC = 100, and HC = 100). Of the metabolites from SBI, 5 were significantly higher (FDR&#60;0.1) in PC patients than in controls. The most significant metabolite in PC was L-Cystathionine, which has been shown to be upregulated in bone-metastatic PC3 cells. Neither Takara nor Wako exosome fractions showed differently expressed metabolites between any groups. Our EEI analysis showed the highest lipid EEI from SBI in PC (474.4) and LC (906.74), while a lower lipid EEI from Takara in PC (359.9), LC (495.58), and Wako in PC (307.5) and LC (148.1). Metabolite EEI showed an EEI range from 590.3 in SBI PC to 185.6 in Takara LC. SBI, again, achieved the highest EEI for both PC and LC (357.3).<br \/>Conclusion: These results support that the SBI method can capture more heterogeneous exosome populations, possibly because this size exclusion-based method does not discriminate exosomes with different protein components. In contrast, Takara and Wako methods target exosome surface proteins, enriching specific exosome subpopulations resulting in less diversity of detectable lipids and metabolites. Overall, these findings suggest that exosome isolation methods can select subpopulations and determine the exosome content, which will significantly impact exosome-based biomarker discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f3e451a4-4f79-4701-bd7a-1d749b7f70e2\/@w03B8ZBf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Circulome,Prostate cancer,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12828"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alex C.
