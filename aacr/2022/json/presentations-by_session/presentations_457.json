[{"Abstract":"In a recent clinical trial in heavily pretreated estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC), ~23% of patients reached the primary endpoint of clinical benefit of <u>&#62;<\/u>24 weeks on Fulvestrant plus the anti-androgen Enzalutamide. <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutant biopsies had more T regulatory cells (t test p&#60;0.021) and macrophages (p&#60;0.003) than <i>ESR1<\/i> wild type (WT), which had more <i>TP53<\/i> mutations and higher levels of cytotoxic T effector cells (p&#60;0.01). In addition, PD-L1 increased in post- vs. pre-treatment biopsies (paired t test p&#60;0.002). This increase in PD-L1 post-treatment warrants testing if the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor to the Fulvestrant-Enzalutamide combination will enhance therapy efficacy in ER+ MBC resistant to standard endocrine therapy. However, the lack of immune competent ER+ breast cancer pre-clinical models is a major barrier to these studies. Human immune system (HIS) mouse models were developed as a platform in which to test immune checkpoint inhibitors in other human cancers, and one HIS model was recently shown to support the growth and immune infiltration of ER+ patient-derived xenograft (PDX) primary tumors.<br \/>We tested whether HIS mice are a robust model in which to define ER+ tumor-immune microenvironment interactions at metastatic sites. We implanted NCG mice (NOD-<i>Prkdc<sup>em26Cd52<\/sup>Il2rg<sup>em26Cd22<\/sup><\/i>\/NjuCrl) humanized by engraftment of human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34<sup>+<\/sup>&nbsp;(huCD34<sup>+<\/sup>) stem cells with the estrogen-independent HCI-013EI (013EI) PDX, derived from an ER+, invasive lobular MBC which harbors the Y537S <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation. Mice were monitored for tumor latency and growth rate, and primary tumors and organs were collected for immunohistochemistry , single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), and phasor-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).<br \/>The ER mutated PDX 013EI had a longer tumor latency in HIS (median 77 days) vs. age-matched immune deficient control mice (27.5 days, log-rank p=0.043). Once formed, 013EI tumors in HIS mice grew slower than those in controls (mixed-effects analysis, p=0.035). HIS mice had visible lung, liver, and\/or gastrointestinal tract metastases despite small primary tumors. Lung metastases from HIS mice retain ER expression and are infiltrated by human CD4+, CD8+, and CD68+ immune cells. Initial scRNAseq analysis also suggests infiltration by diverse immune cell populations in primary tumors from HIS mice. Initial phasor-FLIM for NADH autofluorescence suggests that 013EI tumors are highly glycolytic in HIS mice.<br \/>In conclusion, our results show that huCD34+ HIS mice effectively support growth, metastasis, and immune infiltration of an <i>ESR1<\/i> mutant MBC PDX. Ongoing studies will further define the tumor-immune microenvironment in this and <i>ESR1<\/i> WT MBC PDX, focusing on immune cell infiltration, PD-L1 expression, steroid receptor status, metabolic signaling and changes in these parameters following novel combinations of endocrine, immunotherapy and metabolic agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d5dc24d5-c982-437d-803a-22d946a16620\/@x03B8ZMc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Hormone receptors,Immune cells,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14328"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ayodeji Olukoya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaymaa Bahnassy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole S.

A major limitation for many humanized mouse models is the lack of functional and mature human innate immune cells, which are critical for effective human immune system-tumor interactions. Previous studies have demonstrated that delivery of human FLT3L into immunodeficient mice that lack mouse FLT3, promotes the development of human innate immune cell subsets following engraftment with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Here we describe a NOD-<i>scid IL2rg<sup>null<\/sup><\/i> (NSG) mouse that lacks the expression of mouse FLT3 and expresses human FLT3L transgenically (NSG-mFLT3<sup>null<\/sup>Tg (HuFLT3L) or NSG-FLT3L. In these studies, NSG-FLT3L and NSG mice were engrafted with human umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ HSC and compared for human immune system development and function. HSC-engrafted NSG-FLT3L and NSG mice show similar levels of total human CD45+ cells in blood over the course of 18 weeks post-engraftment. However, HSC-engrafted NSG-FLT3L mice show significantly higher levels of human CD141<sup>+<\/sup> and CD1c<sup>+<\/sup> DC subsets, CD123+ pDC, CD14+ monocytes, CD56+ NK cells and CD3+ T cells in the blood as compared to NSG mice. CD34-FLT3L mice also show increased levels of human immune cell infiltration into the gut mucosa. CD56+ NK cells and CD3+ T cells from HSC-engrafted NSG-FLT3L mice express granzyme A and granzyme B, indicating cytotoxic activity. Following treatment of HSC-engrafted NSG-FLT3L mice with LPS, heightened levels of human cytokines were detected in serum samples, confirming innate immune system function. The growth kinetics of tumor cells from a triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and a lung PDX model LG1306 in HSC-engrafted NSG-FLT3L mice are work in progress and will be compared with HSG-engrafted NSG mice. Overall these results demonstrate that the NSG-FLT3L model supports enhanced development of functional, human innate immune cells and is a novel tool to study human immuno-oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/be5cca7c-fcd5-432c-828b-144d579ff423\/@x03B8ZMc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,FLT3,Human,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14330"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Li-Chin Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shantashri Vaidya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pali Kaur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>James G.

Intriguingly, IL21 has been implicated in both positively and negatively regulating immune responses in a cell-type specific manner, suggesting drug candidates that target IL21\/IL21R signaling has therapeutic potential. Specifically, recent reports suggest that antibodies targeting PD-1 fused to IL-21 has a synergistic anti-tumor effect. To generate a suitable animal model for <i>in vivo<\/i> assessment of a human anti-PD-1-IL21 fusion protein, Biocytogen developed humanized PD-1 and IL21R mice (B-hIL21R mice and B-hPD-1\/hIL21R mice) by replacing the murine <i>Il21r<\/i> and <i>P<\/i><i>D-1<\/i> gene with the human IL21R and PD-1 counterparts via homologous recombination. Our data shows that human IL21R was detectable in sorted cells from homozygous B-hIL21R and B-hPD-1\/hIL21R mice, while human PD-1 was detectable in B-hPD-1\/hIL21R mice compared to wild type mice. Furthermore, STAT3 phosphorylation in splenocytes was successfully induced with mouse IL21 or human IL21 in homozygous B-hIL21R mice. In addition, percentages of T cells, B cells, NK cells, DCs, granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and Tregs in homozygous B-hIL21R mice and B-hPD-1\/hIL21R mice were similar to those in wild type mice, demonstrating that introduction of human <i>IL21R <\/i>and <i>PD-1<\/i> genes in place of its mouse counterpart does not change the overall development, differentiation or distribution of these cell types. To evaluate <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of anti-mPD-1-hIL21 and anti-hPD-1-hIL21 fusion proteins, mouse colon adenocarcinoma MC38 cells were subcutaneously implanted into homozygous B-hIL21R mice (female, 6-7-week-old, n=6) or B-hPD-1\/hIL21R mice (female, 6-7-week-old, n=6).

Pathological consequences of VSIG4 expression are associated with inflammatory disorders, lung cancer development, high-grade glioma, and multiple myeloma, suggesting VSIG4 is a potential target for drug development.

Prior preclinical studies elucidated a promising role for IL12 mediating anti-tumor effects, however, clinical studies using cancer patients showed disappointing efficacy results, as well as severe adverse effects, with administration of systemic IL12 therapies. Intriguingly, progress in targeted delivery to the tumor microenvironment renewed high expectations on IL12 as a promising anti-tumor drug either alone or in combination due to its ability to inhibit and\/or reprogram immunosuppressive cell subsets. Therefore, to evaluate the efficacy of IL12 and IL12 analogs in preclinical studies, Biocytogen has successfully generated a novel hIL12A\/hIL12B\/hIL12RB1\/hIL12RB2 knock-in mouse strain. In this mouse model, the full coding sequences (CDS) of the mouse <i>Il12a<\/i> or <i>Il12b<\/i> gene were replaced by their human counterpart <i>IL12A<\/i> or <i>IL12B<\/i> gene sequences respectively. In addition, chimeric CDS, composed of human <i>IL12RB1<\/i> or <i>IL12RB2<\/i> extracellular region plus mouse <i>Il12rb1<\/i> or <i>Il12rb2<\/i> cytoplasmic region, was inserted into the mouse endogenous gene locus in in these animals, to express an IL12 receptor (IL12R) capable of recognizing human IL12 signaling. Expression analysis by RT-PCR detected human IL12A\/IL12B\/IL12RB1\/IL12RB2 mRNA in humanized mice but not in wild-type mice. Additionally, human IL12 p70 was successfully detected in the serum of humanized mice by ELISA. The immune cell subpopulations in spleen, blood, and lymph node did not differ between humanized mice and wild-type mice suggesting no impact on cell differentiation and maturation. Anti-tumor activity of a modified human IL12 was assessed in humanized mice bearing colon cancer MC38 cells and showed tumor inhibitory effects. Moreover, the tumor growth recovered when the administration of the drug was stopped. Altogether, B-hIL12A\/hIL12B\/hIL12RB1\/hIL12RB2 humanized mice provide a promising preclinical efficacy model for human IL12 therapy alone or in combination.

GARP expression has been shown to play an important role in the modulation of latent TGF-&#946;1 activity by regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), and thus, GARP has emerged as an important regulator of peripheral immune tolerance. While GARP expression is critical for homeostasis, increased GARP expression on Tregs is associated with elevated immunosuppression in the context of tumor biology. Because of these immunomodulatory roles, targeting GARP in the context of oncologic or other diseases is of significant interest. Thus, the development of mouse models for safety and efficacy evaluation of GARP-targeted therapeutics prior to clinical trials is needed. To facilitate assessment of novel anti-human GARP antibodies, Biocytogen has generated a humanized GARP mouse model for in vitro functional validation and in vivo efficacy evaluation assays. Using CRISPR-based gene editing technology, the exons of the mouse <i>Garp<\/i> gene that encode the extracellular domain were replaced by the human GARP counterpart. mRNA Expression of the human GARP extracellular domain was confirmed in splenocytes isolated from homozygous humanized mice. Expression of human GARP was readily detected in FoxP3+ Treg cells isolated from the spleen of humanized GARP mice as assessed by flow cytometry. Importantly, the frequency of FoxP3+ Tregs and other mature leukocyte subpopulations, including T and B lymphocytes, Natural killer cells, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and monocytes\/macrophages, was also similar in the blood and spleen of humanized GARP mice compared to wild-type mice. Subsequent in vivo efficacy assays using the MC38 tumor model demonstrated efficacy of the anti-human GARP antibody in slowing tumor growth in humanized GARP mice. Furthermore, combination of anti-human GARP and anti-mouse PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade resulted in a significantly greater tumor inhibition than monotherapies. In summary, GARP humanized mice are a powerful platform for preclinical evaluation of anti-human GARP antibodies for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b7527523-5e52-4204-92cb-8c521981962c\/@p03B8ZMd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunotherapy,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14333"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ruili Lyu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huilin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jenna Frame<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuelei Shen<\/i><\/presenter>.

CD16A (Fc&#947;RIIIA), a low-affinity receptor for the IgG Fc domain, facilitates ADCC and is responsible for triggering the lysis of target cells by natural killer (NK) cells. Human CD16A is closely related to mouse Fcgr4 and is expressed in NK cells and macrophages, but is absent in granulocytes. Alternatively, mouse Fcgr4 is expressed in granulocytes and macrophages and is absent in NK cells. CD16A-based bispecific antibodies targeting NK cells have been studied for cancer therapy. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of CD16A-based bispecific antibody in mouse tumor models, we have successfully generated a novel humanized CD16A knock-in mouse strain (B-hCD16A Mice). Considering the differential expression patterns between human CD16A and mouse Fcgr4, the regulatory region and whole genome sequence of mouse Fcgr4 were replaced by the human CD16A gene. Human CD16A and mouse Fcgr4 protein expression was confirmed in heterozygous B-hCD16A mice by FACS and RT-PCR. Human CD16A protein was detected in NK cells and macrophages of B-hCD16A mice, but not granulocytes. When compared with wild type mice, there were no abnormalities in the populations of immune cells in B-hCD16A mice. CD16A-based bispecific antibody usually binds to CD16A on NK cells, whereas the other arm of the antibody binds to tumor antigen on cancer cells. Initial assessment of the tumorigenicity of MC38 cells were evaluated in B-hCD16A mice, and results indicated that these cancer cells were able to establish tumors in vivo. These data suggest that the B-hCD16A mouse model is an effective tool for future <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy evaluation of therapeutic CD16A-based bispecific antibodies prior to clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e218190d-eabb-4689-8558-3bf353b9411c\/@p03B8ZMd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),Natural killer cells,Transgenic mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14334"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jiahui Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Limei Ma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoxia Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuelei Shen<\/i><\/presenter>.

In 2019, we reported an animal model using non-adult (cord blood derived) hCD34<sup>+<\/sup> hematopoietic stem cells, considered the standard cell source, for humanizing the immune system of NCG mice. In this study we assessed a mouse model using adult patient mobilized hCD34<sup>+<\/sup> stem cells as an alternative source and evaluated engraftment and tumor modulation using checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/>Study Details: We evaluated the anti-tumor effects of an anti-human PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor on basal lung cell adenocarcinoma (A549) in NCGs humanized with adult patient mobilized hCD34<sup>+<\/sup> stem cells. Humanized mice were implanted subcutaneously with A549 cells, and tumor bearing mice (TBM) were randomized into treatment groups when the average tumor size reached a volume of ~80-120 mm<sup>3<\/sup>. Vehicle control mice were treated with isotype control IgG antibody, whereas A549 TBM were dosed with anti-hPD-1 antibody biweekly (10 mg\/kg) for three weeks. Clinical observations, body weights and tumor growth kinetics were recorded throughout the study. At study termination, whole blood, spleen and tumor tissue were collected and processed for immune profiling by multi-color flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: Anti-hPD-1 monotherapy significantly inhibited A549 tumor growth. NCG mice injected with adult patient mobilized hCD34<sup>+<\/sup> stem cells sustained engraftment. At study termination common human leukocytes were distributed in peripheral blood, spleen and tumors of surviving mice. Phenotyping of the cancer microenvironment revealed the presence of lymphoid (T-lymphocytes and subsets including Tregs) and myeloid immune cells (DC, TAM) with the latter lineage less detectable overall. PD-1 checkpoint blockade on average increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell infiltration and decreased Treg frequencies among the TIL population. Generally, human cytokines (IFN-&#947;, IL-2 and TNF-&#945;) were secreted by viable tumor-infiltrating total T-cells (CD3<sup>+<\/sup>) and subsets (CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup>) following <i>ex vivo<\/i> PMA\/Ionomycin stimulation in the presence of Brefeldin A, demonstrating the capability to produce polyfunctional responses.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>This study demonstrates that adult patient mobilized hCD34<sup>+<\/sup> cells can successfully reconstitute NCG mice. An immune modulating anti-tumor response was elicited with tissue infiltration patterns of human leukocytes overall comparable to those found in cord blood derived hCD34<sup>+ <\/sup>humanized NCG mice.

In this model, the mouse <i>Pvrig <\/i>gene was replaced by the human counterpart, and expression of the human PVRIG protein was confirmed in homozygous B-hPVRIG mice. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis showed similar distribution of T-cell subtypes within the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes of B-hPVRIG mice compared to wild-type C57BL\/6. Lastly, our <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy studies showed that homozygous B-hPVRIG mice that were subcutaneously implanted with murine colon cancer (MC38) cells and treated with 30 mg\/kg of the human PVRIG antibody, reached a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of approximately 40%. This data suggests that human PVRIG antibodies significantly inhibit tumor growth in homozygous B-hPVRIG mice. Altogether, our humanized B-hPVRIG mouse model is an effective tool for <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy studies aimed at the development of novel PVRIG immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/786da58d-7c6f-4f40-a5d5-136fe6ce937e\/@p03B8ZMd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Immunotherapy,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14338"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yifu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiawei Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Rebecca Soto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chonghui Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingcong Lin<\/i><\/presenter>.

In previous studies we have demonstrated, that either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), subsets of PBMCs like T- and NK-cells or hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can be used to establish a humanized immune system with functional T-, B-, and NK cells, as well as monocytes and dendritic cells in immunodeficient mice. By transplantation of cell-line-derived (CDX) or patient-derived (PDX) tumor xenografts on humanized mice, we successfully generated a full human tumor-immune-cell model for different tumor entities. Finally, we validated the functionality of these models using checkpoint inhibitors like Ipilimumab (Ipi), Nivolumab (Nivo), Pembrolizumab (Pembro), cell therapies and immune cell engagers.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>HSC-humanized mice were generated by i.v. transplantation of CD34+stem cells to immunodeficient NOG mice. PBMC or isolated T- or NK-cell preparations were used to humanize mice by single or multiple i.v. injections. CDX and PDX from different entities (i.e. lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and breast cancer) were transplanted on those humanized mice. These models were used to evaluate novel immune therapies. Blood and tumor samples were analysed by FACS for immune cell infiltration and activation.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>The transplanted HSCs engrafted in mice and established a functional human immune system with proliferation and differentiation. 14 weeks after HSC inoculation up to 20% of the human immune cells in the blood were functional T-cells, characterized by a high PD-1 expression. The selected CDX and PDX tumors successfully engrafted on humanized mice without significant differences in tumor growth compared to non-humanized mice. Checkpoint inhibitor treatments induced tumor growth delay in selected models. FACS analysis of tumors revealed an increased percentage of tumor infiltrating T-cells. We identified a set of CDX and PDX models without interference with parallel injection of PBMC, T- or NK-cell preparations for the evaluation of immune cell engagers and other cell therapies.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>We established human tumor-immune-cell models of different entities using CDX or PDX in combination with different donor derived immune cell subsets as effector cells. We demonstrated successful engraftment of HSC on immunodeficient mouse strains, generating mice with a functional human hematopoiesis. These models have been employed for preclinical evaluation of novel checkpoint inhibitors, cell therapies and immune cell engagers.

TLR8 is predominantly expressed in lung and peripheral blood leukocytes. Close to the TLR8 gene locus, another TLR family member, TLR7, is also located on chromosome X and potentially can be manipulated by TLR8. TLR8 is an endosomal receptor that recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. After exogenous ssRNA infection, TLR8 will recruit MyD88 and activate downstream signaling. Similarly, miRNAs secreted from tumor cells also can activate TLR8 and lead to activation of the transcription factor NF-&#954;B. Therefore, TLR8 also has been recognized as a potential therapeutic target. TLR8 agonists (e.g. VTX-2337) are undergoing clinical trials as immune stimulants in combination therapy for some cancers. Immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs) were developed by Bolt therapeutics, comprising a TLR7\/8 dual agonist conjugated to tumor-targeting antibodies. ISACs can drive tumor killing by TLR mediated activation of myeloid cells and subsequent T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in tumor clearance and immunological memory. Although human TLR8 arises as a promising target, emerging therapeutic candidates are lacking suitable mouse models on the market for preclinical in vivo screening and efficacy evaluation. Biocytogen has developed a novel TLR8 humanized mouse model (B-hTLR8 mice). Exon 3 of the mouse TLR8 gene, which encodes the extracellular domain, was replaced by human TLR8 counterparts. Human TLR8 protein and mRNA were detected in lung tissue from homozygous B-hTLR8 mice with the absence of mouse TLR8. Additionally, human TLR8 was detectable via flow cytometry in the dendritic cells and monocytes. To further validate the model, we have examined the model in vivo with a benchmark TLR8 agonist GS-9688. We observed TNF&#945; secretion in B-hTLR8 mice but not in wild-type mice. Therefore, B-hTLR8 mouse model is a promising model for preclinical in vivo studies to evaluate TLR8 agonists and antibody-conjugated TLR8 agonists.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c3b15837-19d4-4253-aa37-8b03ca6498a9\/@q03B8ZMe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunostimulation,Transgenic mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14339"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yuelei Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanan Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lingqi Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Bai Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiawei Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chengzhang Shang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jingwen Huang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

B7-family ligands bind via extracellular tandem immunoglobulin-like domains to CD28-family receptors on lymphocytes to communicate co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory signals. B7-H4 remains an orphan ligand, although evidence from knockout mice suggests a co-inhibitory role and its expression on cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages is associated with inhibition of proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cytokine secretion in T cells. B7-H4 is highly expressed in a variety of tumors (e.g., renal, gastric, breast, and ovarian carcinomas) and plays less well-appreciated roles in autoimmune diseases, viral infections, and maternal-fetal immunity. Negative regulation of T cell responses by B7-H4 has also been shown to induce tolerance of islet allografts in mouse models of Type I diabetes. A range of B7-H4-targeted immunotherapy agents have been successfully developed, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, B7-H4\/CD3-targeting bispecific antibodies, and B7-H4-specific CAR-T cells. To evaluate the efficacy of a B7-H4 antibody, Biocytogen generated humanized B-hB7-H4 mice. Our targeting strategy was to replace the murine B7-H4 extracellular domain sequences with their corresponding human sequences. We verified mRNA and protein expression of human B7-H4 in the humanized B-hB7-H4 mice by RT-PCR and Western Blot, respectively. An <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy study demonstrated that B7-H4 antibodies significantly inhibited tumor growth in B-hB7-H4 mice bearing tumors derived from the B16-F10 murine melanoma line.

Interactions between these populations and the factors they secrete play critical roles in determining the host response to cancer. Conventional mouse xenograft models of human cancer lack a competent immune system. Indeed, the use of xenograft models often fail to translate into effective human treatments. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) is characterized by the presence in the lymphonodes of abnormal Reed-Sternberg cells, and many cell types beyond them, in particular Treg. To reconstitute a more complete TME, human PBMCs were injected into NSG mice bearing L540 HL cells. Then over time the presence of various human CD45<sup>+<\/sup> cell populations were monitored within the tumor mass, in the spleen and in circulation. The goal of our study is to gain a better understanding of the interaction of the immune cell infiltrates into the HL microenvironment, leading ultimately to improved treatment outcomes. Lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor showed a predominance of human CD3<sup>+<\/sup> cells (T lymphocytes), even if in the spleen we found both human T and B cells, indicating that this model might help us design more effective treatments. To reflect the immune reconstitution of these animals and its interaction with tumor and to better understand the capacity of T lymphocytes to kill the cancer cells, we evaluated the production of human IFN- gamma. We found an increase of IFN- gamma in L540-bearing mice reconstituted with hPBMCs compared to the mice without them, indicating a certain functionality of the T cells in these tumors. Moreover, in this model, the immune reconstitution did not decrease tumor growth, rendering this model useful for the study of biotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic studies. The model might be useful to study the anticancer therapy at a preclinical level because a remodeling of the anti-tumor immune response can be evaluated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ba9818a-0df8-4956-b5c0-9b2736256763\/@q03B8ZMe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hodgkin's lymphoma,Humanized mouse models,Tumor microenvironment,Biotherapy and Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14341"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Teresa Bilotta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonella Antignani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David J.

Early stage HCC can be treated by local ablation, surgical resection or liver transplantation. Systemic pharmacological options are limited (kinase and immune-checkpoint inhibitors). Most cases of liver cancer occur in the setting of chronic liver diseases. Risk factors include chronic Hepatitis B and C, alcohol addiction and metabolic diseases. HCC is a multistep process comprising chronic liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis\/cirrhosis and cancer formation. Therefore, providing palliative and curative options remains a high medical need. And with the recent success of immunotherapies in HCC, mouse models that better recapitulate the human disease and antitumor immune response are needed. In order to better evaluate new preventive and curative treatments of liver cancers we developed complementary and integrated strategies to mimic the liver cancer initiation and progression steps in mouse models. These models involve chemotoxic agents, diet-induced disorders and syngeneic or xenogeneic tumor implantation strategies. We established an orthotopic syngeneic model using Hepa1.6 mouse liver hepatoma cells, characterized through liver index, alpha-fetoprotein measurement in serum and liver, and MRI. The response to chemotherapy (sorafenib) and immunotherapy (anti PD-1, anti-TLR) was also assessed and show moderate to high efficiency. Moreover, a panel of xenograft models including Patient-Derived Xenograft models (PDXs) are available to assess new treatment options in human HCC with regards of the genetic mutations and the variety of etiologies seen in human. But as xenograft models are not completely mimicking the human situation of both immune and liver microenvironment, we have recently initiated the development of a double humanized (immune and liver) transgenic mouse as a better host for human tumor engraftment. During the course of HCC formation, the liver undergoes cycles of inflammation, necrosis with regeneration, fibrosis, cell dysplasia and ultimately HCC. Thus, we developed a model induced by a low dose of streptozotocin and high fat diet regimen. In this model, mice develop metabolic syndrome NASH and fibrosis within 12 weeks and HCC within 16 weeks. Of interest, 100% of male mice develop HCC within 16 weeks, in accordance with studies showing that men had a 2-to 7-fold higher risk of developing HCC in human. Treatment of mice with lenvatinib alone or in combination with anti-PD1 increases survival and reduces tumor burden as shown with reduced liver weight\/body weight ratio at 16 weeks. Altogether, these results demonstrate the usefulness of this comprehensive platform of preclinical in vivo HCC models to discover and identify novel therapeutic strategies that could circumvent the progression of liver cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79a6b0c6-9283-482f-9335-0884b0caa2d4\/@q03B8ZMe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Immuno-oncology,In vivo,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14342"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Olivier Duchamp<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gael Krysa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loic Morgand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hugo Quillery<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robin Artus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxime Ramelet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Odillard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peggy Provent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvie Maubant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Mignard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabrice Viviani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samira Benhamouche-Trouillet<\/i><\/presenter>.

The development of alternative therapies that target molecular features defining these unresponsive tumors is an active area of research to advance the field and improve clinical management significantly. However, few DLBCL animal models exist to test the efficacy of newly developed treatments and are restricted to transgenic or xenograft mice that often fail to recapitulate its sub-classifications. We explored the utility of humanizing Nod-Scid-IL2R&#947;<sup>null<\/sup> (NSG) strains with human cytokines to establish a pipeline for the rapid, reliable generation of <i>in vivo<\/i> DLBCL models. We transduced the well-established human DLBCL cells, U2932, with the <i>luciferase (Luc)-EGFP<\/i> gene, then sorted for GFP positivity. The 1 x 10<sup>6 <\/sup>U2932-<i>Luc<\/i> cells were injected via tail-vein into eight 12-week-old mice of various humanized NSG strains (representing equal numbers of each sex). We assessed U2932-<i>Luc<\/i> cell engraftment and growth weekly <i>in vivo <\/i>imaging (IVIS 200 Imager). To further evaluate the organ-specific engraftment\/progression of U2932-<i>Luc<\/i> in the mouse, a mouse was sacrificed weekly after 15 minutes of luciferin administration. The organs were extracted and scanned for <i>ex vivo<\/i> IVIS imaging. The spleen, lung, and liver were then fixed with 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin, eosin, and an anti-CD20 antibody to evaluate the tumor infiltration and expansion. <b><\/b> Unlike the previously reported DLBCL humanized strain (MISTRG6) (Hashwah et al., 2019), we included the human IL-6 expressing mouse strain. We found that both the IL6 and IL6\/SGM3 strains were highly permissive to DLBCL growth. The IL-6 strain exhibited a rapid expansion of U2932 cells relative to the IL-6\/SGM3 mice. The IL-6 mice survived longer than IL-6\/SGM3 mice. A significant difference between the median survivals of IL-6 and IL-6\/SGM3 mice (i.e., 48 vs. 42 days) was observed (p &#60; 0.0482). The organ-specific evaluation demonstrated that U2932-<i>Luc<\/i> cells were initially engrafted and grew in the lung, liver, and spleen, subsequently found in the skeleton, ovary, and brain. Of note, we detected significant enlargements of the kidney, spleen, and ovary at the terminal stage. <b><\/b> Our humanized mouse model approach of using U2932 human DLBCL cells transduced with the Luc gene in the NSG-IL-6 and NSG-IL-6\/SGM3 mice reproduced the clinical features of an aggressive DLBCL that paralleled the original patient. This model will provide a new tool to enable the expansion of patient samples while overcoming the current limitations of DLBCL xenografts and transgenic mice. The ability to maintain the growth of patient-derived samples within clinically relevant locations has great potential to more accurately test patient-specific, personalized treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bc0fc13b-c4a5-4d4d-8564-dfd0cbd2f99e\/@q03B8ZMe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,In vivo imaging,Preclinical,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14344"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Syed Hassan Mehdi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying-Zhi Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leonard Shultz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha Kendrick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Donghoon Yoon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

They are often implanted subcutaneously in a microenvironment that is unrelated to the site of origin. This can be problematic when evaluating immune modulating therapies as the tumor microenvironment is known to differ substantially between orthotopic and subcutaneous models. Here, we report the development and characterization of several syngeneic mouse tumor models implanted subcutaneously and orthotopically. The models are characterized by immune infiltrate and response to novel and conventional therapies.<br \/>Methods: Murine MC38 (colon), TRAMPC1 (prostate) and GL261 (glioma) cell lines were implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically in immune competent mice. Tumor growth was monitored at multiple timepoints by external caliper measurements, magnetic resonance (MR) or ultrasound imaging. At confirmed tumor take, mice were treated with external radiation therapy (RT) or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Single cell suspensions were prepared from tumors and tumor draining lymph nodes (TdLNs) at various timepoints after treatment initiation and immuno-profiling was evaluated by multicolor flow cytometry. The tissues were analyzed for proportions of the following cell populations; CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T lymphocytes, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), NK cells and macrophages.<br \/>Results: Subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor volumes developed at a similar pace. However, orthotopic tumor volumes estimated by MR imaging were detectable at earlier timepoints compared to subcutaneous volumes estimated by caliper measurements. Response to therapy was dependent on implantation site. This was further highlighted by the immune infiltration analysis, where CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> tumor infiltrating lymphocytes differed markedly between subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors. Also, the temporal profile of tumor infiltrating immune cells up to 14 days following therapy was established in the models.<br \/>Conclusion: Subcutaneous and orthotopic versions of syngeneic mouse tumor models were successfully established and characterized with respect to their tumor immune microenvironment. The models displayed varying sensitivity towards RT and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Response to therapy was furthermore dependent on implantation site. Altogether, these advanced models are powerful tools for investigating treatment effect within preclinical immuno-oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/181ece65-c785-4a1f-aec0-82e0f0ce4f53\/@q03B8ZMe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-06 Noninvasive imaging in animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Orthotopic models,Noninvasive imaging,Radiation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14347"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sigrid Cold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saif AL-Haidar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Solgaard Joergensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trine Bjoernbo Engel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederikke Petrine Fliedner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lotte Kellemann Kristensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Kjaer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Carsten Haagen Nielsen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Orthotopic implantation of liver cancer cell lines can be time consuming and inefficient due to the surgical procedures involved to establish the tumour. This study assesses the benefits of replacing traditional invasive surgical orthotopic implantation of two hepatic tumour cell lines with a minimally invasive ultrasound guided approach. Tumour growth of both implantation methods were assessed using ultrasound and bioluminescence, as well as duration of surgery and animal recovery time. In addition, the immune landscape of both implantation methods was assessed using flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Hep3B and Hepa 1-6 cells were transfected with luciferase for bioluminescence imaging. Hep3B-luc or Hepa 1-6-luc cells were orthotopically injected into the left liver lobe of C57BL\/6 mice via either conventional surgery or ultrasound guided injection. Tumour growth was measured using both Ultrasound (Fujifilm Vevo 3100 imaging system, Visualsonics) and bioluminescence (IVIS&#174; Spectrum <i>in vivo<\/i> imaging system, Perkin Elmer). Surgery times were recorded as the duration each animal was under anaesthesia. Recovery times were reported as the time animals were held in recovery before returning to their cage. An in house validated flow cytometry T cell panel was used to assess T cell infiltration in the Hepa1-6 syngeneic model.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A comparison of tumour volume versus tumour associated bioluminescence demonstrated good correlation between both methods for each cell line. The duration of surgery and post implantation recovery times were significantly reduced for mice that underwent ultrasound-guided implantation compared to surgery, as well as fewer post-operative clinical observations. No significant difference in body weight was observed throughout the study. T cell infiltration by flow cytometry assessment enabled further evaluation of potential differences in the immune landscape of Hepa 1-6 tumours.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Ultrasound guided implantation of orthotopic hepatic tumours is a minimally invasive technique that leads to improved recovery times for animals, which adheres to the principles of the 3R&#8217;s. The time taken for ultrasound guided implantation compared to traditional surgical methods was also significantly reduced, enabling a higher throughput of animals on study. Tumour growth kinetics in both Hep3B and Hepa 1-6 models were comparable between the 2 methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4948321f-c890-44e5-804d-3c31ac3950d8\/@q03B8ZMe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-06 Noninvasive imaging in animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Orthotopic models,Ultrasound,In vivo imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14350"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chris Payne<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasmin Amer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruth Storer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ganisha Hutchinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucy Harris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Miles<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yinfei Yin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Histologic characterization confirmed markers of high nuclear proliferation (30% Ki67) and presence of neovascularity (3% Von Willebrand Factor VIII) in all tumors. Serial in vivo imaging was performed to determine a clinically relevant late stage of tumor across all rats before initiation of treatment, accounting for heterogeneity of tumor size and growth rate characteristics. Overall survival was measured following oral administration of control, Temozolomide (TMZ), or combination therapy with TMZ and Idasanutlin.<br \/>Eighteen Rag2 Null rats were intracranially implanted with GB10, a well characterized, recurrent cell line from the Mayo Clinic Brain Tumor Patient-Derived Xenograft National Resource. Bi-weekly high resolution, 2-dimensional T2 magnetic resonance imaging (2DT2 MRI) was performed on a Bruker 9.4 tesla scanner until tumor volume reached 30 &#181;L. 14 days later, simultaneous positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET MRI) was performed on each rat with three dimensional T1 post-contrast (3DT1 CE), amino acid-based 18F-Flouroethyltyrosine (18F-FET), and amide proton transfer-chemical exchange saturation transfer (amide-CEST). Measured tumor parameters included volumetry (3DT1 CE), metabolic activity (18F-FET), and mobile phase intracellular protein content (amide-CEST), to confirm late-stage viable tumors of similar size (15.3 mm^2 +\/-1.38 based on SEM, N=16) and metabolism (2:1 ratio of activity of tumor relative to contralateral control brain tissue). Two rats were removed: 1 died prematurely of infection and 1 had extra-axial tumor location.<br \/>Oral treatment groups were as follows: Control (N= 5), TMZ (N=6) or TMZ + Idasanutlin (N=5). Kaplan Meier survival curves for the TMZ treated group (80.2+\/-4.1 days) and combined TMZ + Idasanutlin group (93.8+\/-6.2 days) were both significantly increased (P&#60;0.001) compared to control (67.4+\/-4.5 days). Survival for the TMZ + Idasanutlin treated group was also significantly increased (P&#60;0.001) relative to TMZ treated group indicating efficacy of combination therapy.<br \/>In conclusion, a robust, resistant, patient derived GBM animal model was developed using serial, high field, non-invasive, multimodality, molecular imaging along with histopathologic analysis. Feasibility of assessing treatment response was also demonstrated with both a standard of care and experimental combination therapy, in the late stage of GBM growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/de9329ca-f6ff-4dc8-a866-fa5b4a46a08d\/@q03B8ZMe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Animal models,In vivo imaging,Chemotherapy response,Molecular imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14351"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luke R.

Hepatocarcinogenesis is a multistep process and to date it is still poorly understood. HCC occurs almost entirely in patients with underlying chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Pre-clinical animal models play an important role in unveiling cancer biology which can facilitate development and testing of new antineoplastic drugs. The aim of this study was to establish an orthotopic model of HCC utilizing two cell lines Huh-7 and HepG2, which could be effectively used to study efficacy of new potential treatments. In a follow up study, the correlation of tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and tumor growth was investigated. AFP was measured using Quantikine&#174; ELISA kit. For the intrahepatic (ih) inoculation cancer cells were injected into the left lobe of the liver. For the intrasplenic (is) inoculations of HCC cells, the spleen was exposed, and cells were injected into spleen parenchyma along the long axis of the spleen. Afterwards spleen was removed to avoid intrasplenic tumor growth. The animals were weighed two times a week throughout the study and appearance of any clinical signs was closely monitored. The animals were terminated 70 days after cancer cell implantation. The mice did not present with any acute symptoms before the end stage disease. However, prior sacrifice some swelling and darkening of the abdominal area especially in the ih-model was observed. To visualize liver ExiTron Nano 6000 nanoparticle contrast agent was used. The contrast agent was administered intravenously once during the study, prior the first imaging. Disease progression was monitored using Bruker SkyScan 1276 High-Resolution Micro-CT Scanner. The <i>in vivo <\/i>measurements were performed using one field of view (FOV) and an image pixel size of 18 &#956;m. Each <i>in vivo <\/i>scanning was completed within 12 minutes and the estimated radiation dose was kept under 500 mGy at each imaging session. The first tumours were detected by &#181;CT between 2-3 weeks depending more on the cancer cell implantation route than the cell line used. The take rate in the liver was 85% in the ih-model, and less than 50% in the is-model. The intrahepatic inoculation led to more uniform and measurable tumor nodules observed in majority of operated animals, whereas the intrasplenic tumors were dispersed throughout with multiple nodules. In addition, a tight correlation between tumor volume and amount of alpha-fetoprotein detected from serum samples was found. In conclusion, an orthotopic model using intrahepatic approach of cancer cells implantation was established. Application of &#181;CT enabled following tumor growth and recognition of cancer spread in the abdomen. Altogether this provides a promising tool contributing to the development of novel therapies targeting HCC <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ab57dfb-f0e6-4caf-bcd4-38a44b517fcb\/@r03B8ZMf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Malignant progression,Mouse models,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14352"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Justyna Zdrojewska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mari Suominen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shirin Katoozi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katja Fagerlund<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jukka Rissanen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roger Malerbakken-Bjerke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenny Karlsson<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, advanced prostate cancer is difficult to treat due to a lack of effective approaches for disrupting immune tolerance. RM-1 is a murine prostate cancer cell line derived from a Ras\/Myc-induced prostate cancer. RM-1 is of particular interest because it is an aggressive, nonimmunogenic, potentially metastatic prostate line that is androgen independent. Subcutaneous growth kinetics were evaluated for RM-1 cells implanted at two cell inocula (1.0E+06 and 5.0E+05 cells\/implant). RM-1 grew aggressively across both implant conditions, producing 100% take rate, a median tumor volume doubling time of ~2 days, and a median time to euthanasia criteria (2000 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) of ~11 days. Bioanalysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) composition via flow cytometry confirms that the RM-1 tumor model has characteristics of a nonimmunogenic or a &#8220;cool&#8221; tumor. CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell populations ranged from 0.7 to 1.9% of the CD45+ cells. Comparatively, G-MDSC and M-MDSC populations were much higher at 8.3 and 63.8% of CD45+ cells. This type of TIL profile is ideal for combination therapies, providing a clear opportunity to turn a &#8220;cool&#8221; tumor &#8220;warm&#8221; and therefore potentially more responsive to treatment. To further characterize the RM-1 model, we evaluated anti-mPD-1, anti-mPD-L1, and anti-mCTLA-4. As expected, based on the TIL profile, single agent treatment with checkpoint inhibitors produced minimal anticancer activity, with no tumor regressions, and &#60;56% punitive responders. We also evaluated the anticancer activity of focal beam radiation treatment via small animal radiation research platform (SARRP). Single agent radiation treatment was highly effective, with 20, 10 and 5 Gy producing, 100, 78 and 89% incidence of putative responders. Radiation treatment at 5 Gy was selected as an ideal candidate for combination therapy. Combination therapy of radiation treatment at 5 Gy paired with anti-mPD-1, was evaluated to determine if there was an increase in activity with a two-prong approach. Historically, radiation treatment has been used to increase tumor infiltration and reduce the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, allowing for increased efficacy. Single agent treatment of anti-mPD-1 or radiation treatment (5 Gy) resulted in 20 and 30% incidence of putative responders. Combination therapy of anti-mPD-1 and radiation (5 Gy) resulted in 100% putative responders. Overall, the RM-1 model has proven to be a reliable and reproducible syngeneic tumor model for prostate cancer. Its presumed immunosuppressive microenvironment is clinically relevant and can provide a direct correlation to patient prostate cancer. Future studies will include orthotopic implant optimization with checkpoint inhibitor efficacy evaluation, including TIL analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9aa6362d-3c49-475d-8adb-358a0974c6cf\/@r03B8ZMf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Prostate cancer,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14504"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justin Snider<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derrik Germain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Allison<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alden Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvie Kossodo<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, for human CD73 mAb with no binding to murine CD73, CD73 humanized mouse models are essential for medicinal development.We established CD73 humanized mouse model (hCD73) on C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c background in which the mCD73 was replaced with hCD73. Similar expression level of hCD73 in peripheral blood was observed compared with mCD73 in wildtype mice. Besides, the proportion of T, B and NK cells in spleen of hCD73 mice were also analogy to that in wildtype mice. After treating with anti-hCD73 antibody, tumor growth was inhibited in our CT-26-hCD73 tumor model.Furthermore, hPD1\/hPDL1\/hCD73 mouse models were also established on C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c backgrounds based on hCD73 mice. However, a better anti-tumor effect of anti-CD73 antibody was found on BALB\/c-hPD1\/hPDL1\/hCD73 bearing CT26 than that on B6-hPD1\/hPDL1\/hCD73 bearing MC38. Besides, Combination of anti-CD73 and anti-PD1 significant elevated anti-tumor effect comparing with anti-CD73 and anti-PD1 mono therapy in BALB\/c-hPD1\/hPDL1\/hCD73 mice bearing CT26-hPDL1hCD73.In conclusion, BALB\/c-hPD1\/hPDL1\/hCD73 is a well efficient mouse model for therapeutic effect study of anti-CD73 and relevant combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a93952a-f268-4759-bc11-385a5289d678\/@r03B8ZMf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD73,Mouse models,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21406"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xing Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunxiang Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Zhiying Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
