[{"Abstract":"Our goal for this study is to use a mouse genetics approach to identify host germline genetic variants that determine therapeutic responses to cancer immunotherapy (IMT) and to validate these findings in cancer patients treated with &#945;-PD-1. The information gathered may lead to drug targets that potentiate IMT responses and genetic markers may contribute to risk scores for response to IMTs. Immune Checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy leads to remarkable clinical responses, including highly durable complete responses in a fraction of patients. Consequently, &#945;-PD-1\/PDL-1 is now first-line therapy for treating melanoma and NSCLC (non-small cell lung carcinoma). However, most patients do not respond to &#945;-PD-1 therapy, and few show systemic adverse effects. There is therefore an unmet need to develop biomarkers and drug targets that will potentiate therapeutic responses to ICBs. Firstly, we found that blockade of active TGF&#946; using therapeutic antibodies synergizes with &#945;-PD-1 therapy to potentiate tumor rejection, thus, we hypothesized that variant genetic modifiers of TGF&#946;1 may influence outcomes of &#945;-PD-1 therapy. By utilizing Tgfbm3b-C57BL\/6 (Tgfbm3b-C57) mice carrying a genetic variation of TGF&#946;1 to study the anti-tumor response to IMT, we confirmed that Tgfbm3b-C57 potentiated anti-tumor responses to &#945;-PD-1 and to combinatorial &#945;-PD-1\/&#945;-TGF&#946; IMT with higher induction of CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor cytotoxicity. The C57 allele contains gene Adam17 that encodes an amino acid variant, L613V, and a charge change at amino acid 113 (D113N). Protein ADAM17 is a sheddase that involves in TNF&#945; biosynthesis and sheds the TGF&#946; type I receptor (T&#946;RI) to attenuate TGF&#946; signaling. To understand the molecular function of the variants, the vectors encoding wildtype (NIH) ADAM17 that carries D113, L613 versus the variant (C57) ADAM17 that has N113, V613, are being transfected and tested for the action on a panel of ADAM17 substrates including TNF&#945; and T&#946;RI on NIH3T3 cell line. We are also investigating whether genetic variation within the syntenic human TGFBM3 locus confers differential survival benefit to patients after &#945;-PD-1 therapy. We will confirm the genetic association of ADAM17 SNPs and screen the TGFBM3b locus from LPIN1 to HPCAL1, and YWHAQ to DDEF2. The dataset includes genome-wide association data from progression-free survival analysis of 2000 NSCLC patients following &#945;-PD-1 therapy. The preliminary data from our initial cohort (n=862) of NSCLC patients on PD-1 inhibitors are currently being evaluated. By investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Tgfbm loci influence ICB outcomes and addressing the relevance to human cancer patients, this project not only addresses an important basic science question but may ultimately lead to novel biomarkers or drug targets that can improve IMT outcomes and reduce adverse effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68e8f679-4967-4f72-84cb-c591bf827300\/@u03B8ZBQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Genetic polymorphism,TGF-&#946;,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16575"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Szu-Ying Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ons Mamai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosemary Akhurst<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, many patients still fail to respond to single immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The need for combination therapies to increase anti-tumor responses is becoming important. Interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) is frequently overexpressed in various cancer types and promotes tumor cell survival. PD-L1, a well-known immune checkpoint, is up-regulated in malignant tumors and inhibits T-cell activity. In this study, we aimed at a combination therapy using an IL4R-targeted cytotoxic peptide and PD-L1-blocking peptide. To target IL4R-high tumor cells, we exploited IL4RPep-1-KLA composed of IL4RPep-1, an IL4R-binding peptide, and (KLAKLAK)2, a cytotoxic peptide. IL4RPep-1-KLA induced necrosis as well as apoptosis of IL4R-expressing tumor cells and increased the secretion of CRT, HMGB1, and ATP, well-known markers of immunogenic cell death (ICD). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the conditioned medium of tumor cells treated with IL4RPep-1-KLA enhanced the expression of CD86 and CD80 on dendritic cells, suggesting the activation and maturation of dendritic cells through ICD. Sequential treatment with IL4RPep-1-KLA followed by PD-L1Pep-2, a PD-L1-blocking peptide, during the co-culture of tumor cells and CD8+ T-cells activated T-cell activity including T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion more efficiently than single treatment with IL4RPep-1-KLA or PD-L1Pep-2, or simultaneous treatment. These results suggest that sequential, combined treatment with the IL4R-targeted cytotoxic peptide and PD-L1-blocking peptide can induce ICD of tumor cells and maturation of dendritic cells and subsequently activate T-cells. This treatment is a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f83e5d73-3fdf-4989-b881-1cba6c736e64\/@u03B8ZBQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,interleukin-4,Phage display,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16577"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nawon Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byungheon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunsu Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

Clinically successful antibodies exert antitumor activity by targeting tumor cells directly (e.g. anti-HER2 mAb in HER2+ breast cancer, anti-CD20 mAb in B cell cancer) or by targeting and activating immune cells that seek and destroy cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment (immune checkpoint blocking antibodies; ICB). Still, many patients fail to respond or acquire resistance to these therapies. Understanding mechanisms and overcoming resistance to distinct classes of antibody drugs, is therefore clearly warranted and has the potential to further improve cancer outcomes. The inhibitory Fc gamma receptor (Fc&#947;R) IIB imbues resistance to cancer immunotherapy by several mechanisms, acting both on tumor and immune effector cells. We previously developed an Fc&#947;RIIB blocking antibody (BI-1206) which is currently being explored in clinical trials (NCT03571568, NCT04219254, and NCT02933320). BI-1206 was found to have cytolytic activity against malignant B cells and the ability to block rituximab internalization from tumor cells, as well as enhance rituximab therapeutic activity in mice humanized for CD20 and Fc&#947;RIIB or bearing relapsed\/refractory CLL in vivo. Emerging data demonstrate that Fc&#947;Rs modulate the therapeutic activity of many therapeutic antibodies among them HER2 targeting antibodies such as Trastuzumab. Trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy significantly improves overall survival of HER2+ breast cancer patients. However, many patients remain uncured and develop Trastuzumab resistance resulting in relapse of the disease. Means of improving anti-HER2 therapy and overcoming resistance are therefore highly desirable. We report the generation of a fully human Fc&#947;RIIB-blocking antibody (BI-1607) engineered to eliminate Fc-mediated Fc&#947;R binding and function (Fc-null anti-Fc&#947;RIIB). Using a mechanism-of-action-matched surrogate antibody, we demonstrate that Fc-null anti-Fc&#947;RIIB enhances therapeutic efficacy, both in tumor growth and overall survival of anti-HER2 in the syngeneic immune competent TUBO mouse model. This enhanced therapeutic efficacy is associated with increased tumor influx of myeloid and NK-cells. Collectively our results provide proof-of-concept for Fc-null anti-Fc&#947;RIIB to enhance anti-HER2 in the treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc8ddba1-9d82-4fc1-a334-8b0cc56971ff\/@u03B8ZBQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Breast cancer,Drug resistance,Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16578"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Linda Mårtensson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Oldham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Borggren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathilda Kovacek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Therese Blidberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulla-Carin Tornberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ingrid Karlsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steve Beers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Cragg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ingrid Teige<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Björn Frendeus<\/i><\/presenter>.

This indicates a need for approaches that can guide development of complex (&#8805; 3 drug) I-O combination treatments by enabling far greater mechanistic understanding of response to drug exposure by components of the authentic tumor microenvironment (TME). Here we show how an approach based on two technologies, the Presage Comparative In Vivo Oncology (CIVO) Platform and the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (GeoMx DSP), highlights drug synergies as well as mechanisms of resistance to drug exposure in the native and intact TME of cancer patients, providing a path to rapid identification of effective drug combinations. The CIVO platform enables trackable multiplexed intratumoral delivery of microdosed drugs, either as single agents or in combinations, allowing evaluation of the localized tumor response to drug candidates in the TME while capturing tumor heterogeneity and patient diversity. GeoMx DSP is a method for high-plex spatial profiling of mRNAs with rare-cell sensitivity. Combining these technologies in Phase 0 clinical studies in human soft tissue sarcoma patients we evaluated distinct tumor sites microdosed with either nivolumab (anti-PD1), aldesleukin (recombinant IL-2), the combination of nivolumab and aldesleukin, vehicle (no drug), or chemotherapy controls. Using the Nanostring Cancer Transcriptome Atlas we evaluated the effect of drug exposure on expression of over 1,800 genes simultaneously with spatial resolution across individual patient tumors. Synergistic elevation of multiple transcripts was observed at tumor sites exposed to the combination of aldesleukin and nivolumab. This included T-cell specific elevation of granzyme B, a classic biomarker of T-cell activation. Importantly, we show how events such as T-cell activation may be dampened by feedback loops involving immune suppressive responses including, but not limited to, elevation of IDO-1 in non-T-cell components of the TME. Results were observed across multiple patient tumors and were verified by conventional immuno-histochemistry or in situ hybridization. Performing these studies across different patients allows us to explore the inter-individual variation in drug responses. We believe this is an efficient and biologically relevant approach to better understanding feedback loops activated within the authentic TME and ultimately prioritizing drug combinations for clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/827a17a3-da72-4820-85fb-d2ef3142dd74\/@u03B8ZBQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint,Tumor microenvironment,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16580"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jason P.

These include rituximab for CD20-expressing lymphomas, trastuzumab for HER2-amplified cancers, and cetuximab for EGFR-driven solid tumors. Although the primary mechanism of action for these therapies is tumor-cell targeting, they are rarely curative, partly because tumor cells employ a variety of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance and blunt anti-tumor immune response. CD47 is upregulated in solid tumors and hematological malignancies and provides a critical anti-phagocytic signal to escape destruction by the innate immune system. Thus, CD47 may represent a promising therapeutic target for activating innate and adaptive immunity and enhancing the therapeutic potential of SoC antibodies in the clinic.<br \/>Here we present preclinical data supporting the combinatorial effects of the CD47-targeting monoclonal antibody ZL-1201 with SoC mAbs in hematologic and solid tumor models. ZL-1201 potently blocked CD47\/SIRP&#945; interaction and enhanced phagocytosis as measured by flow cytometry and high-content imaging analysis. Notably, in combination with trastuzumab, cetuximab, and rituximab, ZL-1201 demonstrated enhanced phagocytosis across hematologic and solid tumor models expressing varying levels of CD47 in <i>in vitro<\/i> co-culture systems. Neutralizing the Fc receptor function of these SoC mAbs by blocking CD16, CD32, and CD64 abrogated the combinatorial effects, indicating that the CD47 blockade sensitized tumors to pro-phagocytic signals provided by ADCP-inducing mAbs in an Fc receptor-dependent manner. Treatment of xenografts with ZL-1201 also drove tumor-specific immune responses and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, including increased activation of antigen-presenting cells, decreased frequencies of MDSC, and reduced expression of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1. Further, ZL-1201 in combination with trastuzumab, rituximab, or cetuximab significantly delayed tumor growth and increased survival in <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft models, highlighting the pivotal role for CD47 as a resistance mechanism to these therapeutic mAbs and the opportunity to overcome resistance with ZL-1201 combination.<br \/>In conclusion, ZL-1201 enhances the anti-tumor activity of SoC antibodies and augments the immunologic response by overcoming the CD47\/SIRP&#945; &#8220;don&#8217;t-eat-me&#8221; myeloid checkpoint. This study indicates that ZL-1201 may combine with a broad range of SoC mAbs to enhance their clinical benefit across a variety of hematologic and solid tumor indications.

Preclinical models have demonstrated the synergistic benefit of combined CD47\/SIRP&#945; and PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade. Combinations of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting these two checkpoint pathways are being explored in the clinic. CD47xPD-L1 bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) stand as an attractive alternative to mAb combinations, even more so as they provide a potential solution to improve the pharmacokinetic profile and safety issues faced by CD47 targeted-mAbs and SIRP&#945;-Fc fusion proteins. CD47xPD-L1 bsAbs are expected to preferentially inhibit CD47 on PD-L1 expressing cells, displaying improved safety and pharmacokinetics, but also superior tumor microenvironment targeting capabilities. With the objective of finding the optimal CD47xPD-L1 bsAb, an array of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) was generated associating a high affinity PD-L1 arm to CD47 arms with varying affinities. The CD47xPD-L1 bsAbs of human IgG4 isotype were generated using our fully human &#954;&#955; body antibody platform. The candidate molecules were screened for binding and receptor-blocking activity and tested for their capacity to enhance T-cell activation and phagocytosis of tumor cells in the presence of anti-HER-2 mAb, trastuzumab. Selected bsAbs were also evaluated in a xenograft mouse model. The CD47xPD-L1 bsAbs demonstrated an effective blockade of the PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction, being able to induce T-cell activation <i>in vitro<\/i> similar to the anti-PD-L1 clinical benchmark, atezolizumab. Consistent with their CD47 affinities, the bsAbs showed varying levels of CD47 blockade on PD-L1-negative cells and a low binding capacity to red blood cells. Nonetheless, trastuzumab-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells expressing low levels of PD-L1 could be significantly enhanced by these bsAbs, confirming the PD-L1-independent activity of the CD47 blocking arms. The latter findings were corroborated <i>in vivo<\/i> using PD-L1-negative Raji cells in a xenograft mouse model. Selected bsAbs will be now tested for tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles in human-CD47\/human-SIRP&#945; transgenic mice.

Co-targeting PD-1\/PD-L1 and the CD47\/SIRP&#945; myeloid checkpoint with monoclonal antibody (mAb) combinations showed increased antitumor responses in preclinical studies. However, CD47 mAbs are hindered by ubiquitous CD47 expression leading to rapid target-mediated clearance and safety concerns, including anemia and thrombocytopenia. Consequently, dual-targeting CD47xPD-L1 bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) enabling selective inhibition of CD47 on PD-L1-positive tumors offer an alternative approach. A fully human bsAb pairing a high affinity PD-L1 arm to a low affinity CD47 arm was generated using the &#954;&#955;-body platform. The latter is also used in our CD47xCD19 bispecific antibody NI-1701\/TG-1801, currently in phase I clinical trials (NCT03804996, NCT04806035). The resulting CD47xPD-L1 bsAb of human IgG1 isotype (NI-2601) was evaluated in various binding and receptor-blocking assays, and then tested for its capacity to enhance T-cell activation <i>in vitro<\/i> and induce Fc-mediated killing of tumor cells through phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). A surrogate bsAb was also evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i> in a syngeneic mouse model. NI-2601 demonstrated effective blockade of PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction, and T-cell activation <i>in vitro, <\/i>similar to the anti-PD-L1 clinical benchmarks atezolizumab and avelumab. Consistent with its low-affinity CD47 arm, the bsAb did not bind to red blood cells (RBC) and CD47 blockade was driven by PD-L1 co-engagement. Using a panel of tumor cell lines, expressing various PD-L1 levels, NI-2601 showed superior activity in ADCP and ADCC as compared to the anti-PD-L1 IgG1 mAb, avelumab. The anti-tumor activity of this approach using surrogate CD47xPD-L1 bsAb was confirmed in a syngeneic MC38 colon carcinoma model. Thus, NI-2601 is able to harness Fc-effector function to eliminate PD-L1-positive tumor cells while sparing PD-L1-negative cells, such as RBC or platelets. Pharmacokinetic and tolerability studies in non-human primate are planned for 2022. <sup><\/sup><sup><\/sup>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0e3c7c2-fd9d-4665-8a3c-9d10fe871d75\/@v03B8ZBR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Immune checkpoint blockade,PD-L1,CD47,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16591"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xavier Chauchet<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Bosson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Margaux Legrand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Cons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sébastien Calloud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alizée Viandier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Françoise Richard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pauline Malinge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tereza Bautzova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jérémie Bourguignon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guillemette Pontini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elise Penarrieta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengzhu Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulla Ravn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valéry Moine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Magistrelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yves Poitevin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stéphanie Hugues<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Limin Shang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Walter Ferlin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krzysztof Masternak<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, not all patients successfully respond to monotherapy and the need for combinations has become more apparent. CTX-8371 combines PD-1\/PD-L1 targeting in one bispecific, tetravalent molecule. CTX-8371 potently blocks PD-1\/PD-L1 <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. This robust activity may be explained by the unique mechanism of action (MOA) of CTX-8371 which involves cell surface PD-1 cleavage. Here we present further <i>in vivo<\/i> evidence of PD-1 cleavage by CTX-8371 detected during a dose range finding (DRF) study in cynomolgus macaques. Results of this study as well as <i>in vitro<\/i> receptor occupancy (RO) and the PK\/PD profile of CTX-8371 in tumor-bearing mice are described. CTX-8371 was administered to female cynomolgus monkeys (n=3\/group) in a single intravenous infusion at 2 mg\/kg or weekly infusions at 10 or 50 mg\/kg, for a total of 2 doses. PBMCs were isolated before, 24 hours after the first dose, or 24 hours after the second dose (for 10 and 50 mg\/kg groups). Immunophenotyping, including PD-1 and PD-L1, was performed on PBMCs by flow cytometry. Mean serum concentration-time data was analyzed to derive PK parameters using noncompartmental and two-compartment models. PK was also determined in tumor-bearing mice using an MSD ELISA-based assay and non-compartmental analysis. In monkeys, CTX-8371 administration resulted in a marked decrease of PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in PBMCs on days 2 and 9 at all dose levels, indicating PD-1 cleavage from the cell surface. These results confirm <i>in vitro,<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> MOA data obtained from mouse studies. Clearance and half-life of CTX-8371 were calculated to be ~6.87 mL\/day\/kg and 5.45 days, respectively, which fall within the expected ranges for a human IgG1 antibody in non-human primates (NHP) with linear PK. CTX-8371 infusion was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys. In tumor-bearing mice, the dose which results in 50% of maximum tumor growth inhibition was found to be 1-2 mg\/kg. The minimum effective dose, at which at least 50% of animals exhibit greater than 50% tumor growth inhibition over two consecutive days, was 1mg\/kg. It was observed that 11% (1\/9), 78% (7\/9) and 100% (9\/9) of mice in 0.1 mg\/kg, 1 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg dose groups, respectively, meet the above criteria. CTX-8371 also showed dose-dependent <i>in vitro<\/i> RO on T cells from peripheral blood of human, cynomolgus monkey, and transgenic hPD-1hPD-L1 mice. Data presented here confirm the unique MOA of CTX-8371, cleavage of PD-1 from the cell surface. The dual blockade of PD-1 and PD-L1, combined with PD-1 cleavage, may offer superior benefit compared to current checkpoint inhibitor therapies. RO data as well as murine and NHP PK\/PD analyses will guide a projected human dose for future development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40b8eed6-0252-41db-aeda-0003a9abdd8e\/@v03B8ZBR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Bispecific antibody,Pharmacokinetics,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16587"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Diana I.

Its expression in normal tissues is restricted to the fetal organs but is not detected in the adult tissues. Increased expression of CLDN6 has been shown in several human malignancies such as testicular, ovarian, uterine, liver and lung adenocarcinoma, and is associated with poor prognosis in these cancer patients. Therefore, CLDN6 is a promising tumor-associated antigen (TAA) for tumor-targeting therapeutics such as CART and T cell engaging bispecific antibodies. CD137 co-stimulation has been reported to lead to extended T-cell proliferation, reactivating anergic T cells, promoting memory T cell formation and maintenance. Activating CD137 with agonistic antibodies presents a great opportunity to improve the therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or overcome resistance to ICIs. Additionally, a bispecific antibody that activates CD137 signaling only in the presence of TAA would help reduce the dose-dependent hepatotoxicity that was observed in clinical trials with monoclonal anti-CD137 agonistic antibody due to the activation of CD137 signaling in liver resident Kupffer cells. NBL-028 is a novel tetravalent bispecific antibody uniquely designed to activate the CD137 co-stimulatory pathway in the tumor microenvironment through the CLDN6-mediated clustering of CD137. NBL-028 binds to Claudin 6 with high affinity and specificity, activates CD137 in a CLDN6-dependent manner with fast-on and fast-off CD137 binding properties. NBL-028 demonstrated strong CLDN6-dependent T-cell activation and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity <i>in vitro<\/i>. NBL-028 elicits potent anti-tumor effects and immunological memory in mouse models without detectable liver damages or systemic toxicity. The tumor infiltrated Lymphocyte (TIL) analysis also demonstrated that NBL-028 treatment induced CD45+ immune cells infiltration, decreased Treg\/CD8 ratio and increased M1\/M2 like macrophage ratio. Furthermore, NBL-028 is designed upon a proprietary molecular scaffold with superior developability features, demonstrated by stability, yield and ease to purify. NBL-028 is currently at the stage of IND-enabling activities with the aim to enter clinical studies for treating Claudin 6 positive solid tumors in 1Q 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f8f56483-2272-4c34-ad02-ad0cf3a19f5a\/@v03B8ZBR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Immuno-oncology,Immunostimulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16588"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Raymond Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Tong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huarui Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Makenzie Danton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha Dillman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua Dewe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua Karchin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samruddhi Patil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danielle Lavery<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haichun Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Pei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhong Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming Lei<\/i><\/presenter>.

LILRB1 and LILRB2 are distinct inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors that recognize MHC-I ligands, particularly immunosuppressive HLA-G. LILRB1-mediated inhibition can lead to impairment of T-cell cytotoxicity and preventing the efficient engulfment of tumor cells by macrophages as a &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal. LILRB2 is expressed primarily by myeloid cells, especially in the tumor microenvironment, as an important immunosuppressive signal to inhibit the stimulation of an immune response. A dual antagonist antibody targeting both LILRB1 and LILRB2 could be more effective for cancer immunotherapy than targeting either LILRB1 or LILRB2 individually.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Mice were immunized with recombinant D1-D2 domain of LILRB1 and LILRB2 proteins. Resulted heavy chain and light chain variable regions of IgG were PCR amplified from splenocytes and bone marrow plasma cells. PCR amplicons were built into yeast libraries. Yeast displayed scFv were screened for LILRB1 and LILRB2 binding. The dual binders were converted to effector silent human IgG1 and evaluated for ability to block HLA-G binding to LILRB1\/RB2. The dual binder and dual blocker were further assessed in series of assays using human T cells and various primary myeloid cell subsets, including human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We have discovered a panel of anti-LILRB1\/2 antibodies that bind to both LILRB1 and LILRB2 with high affinity and block the interactions to HLA-G efficiently. The anti-LILRB1\/2 antibodies inhibit both LILRB1 and LILRB2 signaling and modulate the function of immune cells. Anti-LILRB1\/LILRB2-mediatted LILRB1 blockade: 1) enhances phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages; 2) releases HLA-G mediated inhibition on TCR activation in Jurkat T cells over-expressing LILRB1; 3) promotes the activation of human primary T cells stimulated with allogenic DCs. Anti-LILRB1\/LILRB2-mediatted LILRB2 blockad:1) enhances TNF&#945; expression and inhibits IL10 expression in LPS-stimulated human PBMC; 2) reprograms both hMDMs and TAMs induced by tumor cells to polarize toward a more inflammatory phenotype, including enhanced T cell responses to stimulation by DCs and macrophages, increased expression of M1 markers and secreted proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#945;, decreased expression of M2 markers and secreted anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: We have generated dual antagonist anti-LILRB1\/LILRB2 antibodies. The anti-LILRB1\/LILRB2 can reprogram suppressive myeloid cells to a stimulatory state, enhance phagocytotic function of myeloid cells, and promote the activation of lymphoid cells. The data support further development of anti-LILRB1\/LILRB2 as an immunotherapeutic for solid tumor malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ab9853a2-fe03-49d1-bb5b-61090895a916\/@v03B8ZBR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Antibody,Immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16589"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guangan Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quanju Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lai Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nan Bing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

The candidate bispecific was designed to have unique pharmacokinetic and safety properties to potentially maximize robust anti-tumor responses. APVO442 is designed with Aptevo&#8217;s ADAPTIR-FLEX<sup>TM<\/sup> technology to generate a molecule with low-affinity monovalent CD3 engagement, paired with high-affinity bivalent PSMA binding intended to be tumor - dependent while inducting optimal T-cell stimulation within the tumor microenvironment. The unique engineering of APVO442 reduces the potential peripheral CD3 T cell binding, minimizing the potential for on-target toxicity, such as peripheral cytokine release, while simultaneously increasing the likelihood to deliver an effective concentration of APVO442 locally within solid tumors. Preclinical data demonstrate that APVO442 is able to activate T cells and mediate directed cytotoxicity against PSMA-expressing tumor targets with comparable potency to &#945;-PSMA x &#945;-CD3 constructs with varying CD3 affinity or avidity both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The CD3 activity is dependent on PSMA crosslinking as activity is not observed in the absence of tumor target, in line with the silenced Fc engineered into APVO442. Importantly, cytokine release was not observed in peripheral immune subsets in the absence of tumor targets, despite a beneficial cytokine profile observed in the presence of PSMA positive tumor cell lines. The unique biology elicited by APVO442 induces distinct kinetic activation of downstream transcriptional regulators following monovalent TCR engagement of APVO442 associated with reduced early signaling, but overall, a more sustained activation than higher affinity variants. In addition, APVO442 induces a distinct phenotypic profile on human T cells associated with optimal function and memory responses only in the presence of tumor targets. Further, combination of APVO442 with additional costimulatory agonists supports improved T cell activation and anti-tumor cytotoxicity <i>in vitro<\/i>. These data support the potential for unique clinical combination of APVO442 with immuno-oncology modalities that may support improved benefit in PSMA positive indications such as metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. APVO442 is undergoing further preclinical <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> characterization in support of the IND-enabling package.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f3bad5cd-51db-4b7e-b73e-6b35f9ea49f5\/@v03B8ZBR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,T cell engager,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16590"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rebecca Gottschalk<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Miller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Woodruff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashly Lucas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Haglin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Pavlik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle H.

In some settings, like Fanconi anemia (FA), patients receive curative treatments (allogeneic stem cell transplantation), only to develop HNSCC in early adulthood at a high rate of incidence. Current treatment strategies for non-FA HNSCC patients include surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, these are not viable treatment options for FA HNSCC patients due to their low tolerance for the high toxicity levels of chemotherapy and radiation. Therefore, there is a critical need for novel and targeted therapeutic interventions for the treatment of FA HNSCC patients.<br \/>B7H3, a checkpoint member of the B7 and CD28 families, is overexpressed on several solid tumors but is absent or not expressed on healthy tissues. It is a promising target for immunotherapy, and recent basket trials, particularly in the prostate cancer, have demonstrated strong clinical signals. Here we developed and tested the ability of GTB-5550, a tri-specific killer engager (TriKE) that includes a B7H3 targeting component, to direct NK cell killing to B7H3-expressing Head and Neck cancer targets. This TriKE molecule includes an NK cell engaging domain containing a humanized camelid nanobody against CD16, a camelid nanobody against B7H3 and a wild type IL-15 sequence between the two engagers. We assessed B7H3 expression by flow cytometry of wild-type HNSCC cells and a paired version with a CRISPER KO of the FANCA gene and determined that the KO had no effect on B7H3 expression. Thus, GTB-5550 activity against HNSCC should be present on both normal HNSCC and FA-HNSCC settings.<br \/>NK cell responses against HNSCC lines in the presence of GTB-5550 were assessed through either flow cytometry based functional assays, to evaluate NK cell degranulation and cytokine secretion, or IncuCyte imaging assays, to directly assess target killing. NK cell degranulation and IFN-gamma production of GTB-3550-treated samples were higher compared to that of control samples treated with B7H3 single domain or IL-15 alone. GTB-5550 also induced more HNSCC target cell killing by NK cells compared to treatment with the B7H3 single domain or IL-15 alone irrespective of the FANCA gene. Ongoing experiments will evaluate functionality of GTB-5550 on FA patient samples as well as in spheroid assays. Taken together, this data shows that a GTB-5550 is able to drive NK cell activity against B7H3-expressing HNSCC cells, which presents potential for a B7H3-targeted TriKE to be used to be implemented clinically to treat HNSCC or FA-HNSCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b132205d-4a07-448f-8a6d-8ceb86de0b90\/@v03B8ZBR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Natural killer cells,IL-15,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16592"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Melissa Khaw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary Davis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Zorko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Greg Berk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gavin Choy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Margaret MacMillan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Felices<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jeffrey S.

FLEX NKTrademark is a proprietary platform for production of tetravalent multifunctional NK engager antibodies with a novel FLEX linker to allow for simultaneous binding of both the targeted cancer cells and NK cells. NK engagement and activation is mediated through a binder directed against the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46. With the FLEX NKTrademark scaffold, we created two novel tetravalent NK cell engagers targeting CD38, one with a wild type (WT) Fc and one with a mutant null Fc. Both CD38 NKp46 engagers showed dose dependent binding to CD38 expressing multiple myeloma cell lines MM1S and KMS11 and no binding to a CD38 knock out MM.1S cell line. Both engagers also bound multiple myeloma cell lines with ~ 2-fold higher mean fluorescence intensity than anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb)or daratumumab alone. Epitope mapping studies for our anti-CD38 mAb using alanine scanning mutagenesis showed that amino acid S274 on CD38, critical for binding to daratumumab, is not important for our anti-CD38 antibody binding to CD38, suggesting a distinct epitope detected by our antibody. Interestingly, the NKp46 monoclonal antibody alone without a functional Fc induced peripheral blood NK cell cytolysis of the multiple myeloma cells, consistent with a prior report that NKp46 plays a key role in NK-cell mediated killing of myeloma cells. Both CD38 NKp46 engagers showed further enhanced dose dependent NK cell redirected cytolysis and degranulation against multiple myeloma cells compared to anti-NKp46 monoclonal antibody. The CD38 NKp46 engagers demonstrated higher cytotoxicity than the anti-CD38 binder mAb or daratumumab alone. The CD38 NKp46 engager with the WT Fc is more potent in induction of TNF-&#945; and IFN-&#611; production compared to daratumumab and the engager with the mutant Fc. No IL-1&#946; or IL-6 was induced by the engagers or daratumumab.

Therapeutic candidates (biologics and small molecule inhibitors(SMIs)) targeting ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, enzymes responsible for hydrolyzing ATP to adenosine, and SMIs targeting adenosine receptors are currently under active preclinical and early clinical development. Here we present the characterization of a novel, selective anti-human A2aR antagonist mAb that showed high potency in inhibiting adenosine mediated immunosuppressive functions to enhance anti-tumor immunity.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A panel of mAbs binding to human adenosine receptor A2aR (hA2aR) were generated via hybridoma technology. The specificity and cross-reactivity were measured by FACS using human A1R, A2aR, A2bR, A3R or mouse A2aR over-expressing cells, as well as human and cynomolgus monkey PBMC. The cellular potency of these mAbs was assessed by measuring decreased cAMP levels in engineered HEK293 cells stably over-expressing hA2aR, a <u>G<\/u>s <u>p<\/u>rotein <u>c<\/u>oupled <u>r<\/u>eceptor (GPCR), upon stimulation with agonist NECA. The ability of lead candidate AT-004 to reverse adenosine-mediated immune suppression of human CD8 T-cells was determined using standard CD3\/CD28 activation conditions. The in vivo efficacy of humanized AT-004 is being evaluated using ICB treatment resistant solid tumor mouse models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> AT-004 represents a panel of novel, selective mAbs. These mAbs specifically bind to human A2aR, but not to family members including A1R, A2bR and A3R. Cross-reactivity to cynomolgus monkey PBMCs was also observed. AT-004 inhibited NECA-mediated A2aR activation with a potency over 100-fold higher than SMIs e.g. AZD4635. AT-004 significantly reversed the ability of adenosine to suppress CD8 T cell activation as indicated by restoration of cell surface marker expression and increased levels of cytokines such as IFN-&#947; in the supernatants.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> AT-004 is a potent, selective and highly potent antagonist of A2aR receptor. Considering its potential safety advantage as an mAb comparing to most known A2aR SMI antagonists in that it does not cross the blood brain barrier, AT-004 maybe a promising novel therapeutic candidate for immunotherapy, vital for enhancing anti-tumor responses in solid tumors that show an incomplete response or resistance to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAb treatment due to elevated adenosine level in tumor microenvironment (TME).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5509847c-7682-45ea-9f62-d134e64c020d\/@w03B8ZBS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Antibody,Drug resistance,Adenosine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16594"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Changyun Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiandong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuying Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyan Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Immunostimulatory cytokine, IL-15 is an attractive combination partner to enhance anti-tumor NK and memory CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell expansion and survival. We are developing IGM-7354, a high affinity, high avidity anti-PD-L1 pentameric IgM antibody with an IL-15R&#945; chain and IL-15 fused to the joining (J) chain, designed to deliver IL-15 to PD-L1 expressing tumors for enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. IGM-7354 was generated by grafting heavy chain variable regions of a high affinity humanized anti-PD-L1 IgG onto the IgM heavy chain framework, co-expressed with the light chain and the J chain which included a single IL-15R&#945; and IL-15 fusion. Binding ELISAs were performed using recombinant antigens. IGM-7354 bound human and cynomolgus monkey PD-L1 with similar affinities but did not bind to rat or mouse PD-L1. In addition, the IL-15 component of IGM-7354 bound to human and cynomolgus &#946; chain of the trimeric IL-15 receptor with similar affinities, but with weaker binding affinity to rodent IL-15R&#946;. Using in vitro assays with human and cynomolgus monkey PBMCs, IGM-7354 dose-dependently enhanced the proliferation of NK and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Furthermore, in an <i>in vitro<\/i> MLR setting, IGM-7354 was able to reverse T cell exhaustion beyond that of an IL-15\/IL15R&#945; complex or anti-PD-L1 IgM or IgG alone, as demonstrated<b> <\/b>by an increase in activation and effector cytokine secretion. <i>In vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity and ADCC assays were performed with luciferase-tagged human cancer cell lines and PBMCs. IGM-7354 enhanced <i>in vitro<\/i> killing of PD-L1-expressing cancer cells by human PBMCs in monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents. Efficacy and pharmacodynamic studies in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model showed dose-dependent increases in circulating NK and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which correlated with tumor regression. In cynomolgus monkeys, IGM-7354 markedly induced the proliferation of NK and CD8+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner with a preferential expansion of effector memory CD8+ T cells and &#947;&#948; T cells in the periphery. IGM-7354 stimulates NK and CD8+ T cell expansion in vitro and in vivo plus induces tumor regressions in mouse tumor models in monotherapy or combination with various agents. This approach may enhance tumor localization of the immunostimulatory cytokine IL-15 through high affinity and high avidity binding to PD-L1 thereby improving anti-tumor responses and minimizing toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6775d74d-5ce8-45d2-bb64-6205e630a6d3\/@w03B8ZBS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,PD-L1,Natural killer cells,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16597"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"72c5a26f-2cfb-466e-b57e-4947d164e4d4","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72c5a26f-2cfb-466e-b57e-4947d164e4d4\/@w03B8ZBS\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thierry Giffon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie Desbois<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Poonam Yakkundi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keerthana Sekar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marigold Manlusoc<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodnie Rosete<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Machado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Calhoun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tasnim Kothambawala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dean Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vu Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avneesh Saini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhinav Jain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatrice Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maya Kotturi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce Keyt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angus Sinclair<\/i><\/presenter>.

CEA is constitutively released from tumor cells and reaches detectable levels in peripheral blood, making CEA targeting particularly challenging. Granzyme B is a key effector in immune-mediated killing of target cells, with cell death through both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We developed a fusion protein composed of granzyme B and a human scFv targeting the juxta-membrane epitope of CEA. The construct also incorporates a fragment of human IgG heavy chain to cause dimerization and provide increased <i>in vivo<\/i> circulation and antitumor efficacy. The GrB-Fc-CEA construct was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, transiently expressed by HEK-293E suspension cells, and secreted into the culture media. The final yield after purification and activation was 10-15 mg\/L. The enzymatic activity of granzyme B in GrB-Fc-CEA was comparable to that of commercially available human granzyme B. <i>In vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity against CEA-positive cell lines demonstrated cytotoxicity in the nanomolar range, compared to micromolar range cytotoxicity against control (CEA-negative) cell lines. Importantly, GrB-Fc-CEA cytotoxicity against tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i> was unaffected by exogenously-added CEA (200 ng\/ml) extracellular domain, suggesting that the construct is not competitively absorbed by soluble CEA released by tumors and present in the circulation of patients. GrB-Fc-CEA internalized rapidly (within one hour) into the target cell lines A-431 and HT-1080\/CEA whereas internalization was not observed with untargeted granzyme B, clearly demonstrating receptor-mediated internalization. GrB-Fc-CEA induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation, consistent with the well-described granzyme B mechanism of action. Treatment of female nude mice bearing A-549 tumors with GrB-Fc-CEA (80 mg\/kg over 5 doses) resulted in a significant growth inhibition of the established tumors compared to vehicle controls (1200 mm<sup>3<\/sup> vs &#60;40 mm<sup>3<\/sup>). Complete tumor regression was observed in seven of ten tumors in mice treated with GrB-Fc-CEA. Mouse weight was unaffected in both treated and control groups for the duration of the study, suggesting no apparent toxicity of the construct. Thus, GrB-Fc-CEA appears to have significant potential in targeting a large category of CEA-expressing solid tumors and is a promising candidate for further pre-clinical development.

TME components modulate tumor profiles and treatment responses, thereby affecting sensitivity to anti-cancer agents. The limited clinical success of therapeutics, including immunotherapies, emphasizes an unmet need to identify new targets and develop preclinical platforms to accelerate anti-cancer drug discovery. Although <i>in vitro<\/i> methods are essential in early drug development, standard approaches, which do not capture the complexity of TME, have been historically favored for both discovery and evaluation of potential therapeutics.<br \/>Resonant's IMPACT TME platform couples proprietary high-fidelity TME models with deep data-driven analytics for rapid and cost-effective discovery of novel targets and antibody-based therapeutics. Target and candidate selection is based upon a biology-forward approach driven by live animal immune systems and functional screening prior to target identification. Identified candidates are then prioritized via integration of publicly available information with internal functional and multi-omic data. Resultant targets display attributes, such as tumor selectivity and immune-modulatory capabilities, that are amenable to several therapeutic modalities, including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and bispecifics. To date, Resonant has interrogated a variety of solid tumor types and thousands of candidates resulting in an expanding library of actionable antibodies and targets. Representative examples of <i>in vitro and in <\/i>vivo efficacy of selected candidates derived from the IMPACT TME platform are presented, highlighting their individual potential and validating the Resonant approach.
