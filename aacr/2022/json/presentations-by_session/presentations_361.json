[{"Abstract":"<b>INTRODUCTION:<\/b> Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) represents the most lethal gynecological disease, with a 5-year relative survival rate of 46% after the diagnosis. The standard treatment of advanced EOC is based on surgery, followed by platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapy. However, the development of platinum resistant disease could occur and strongly impact on the survival of EOC patients for whom we still do not have valid therapeutic options. By using a proteomic approach followed by a bioinformatic analysis, we previously validated the role of HSP90 in the mechanism of platinum-resistance. Here, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy based on the combined pharmacologic inhibition of HSP90 and mTOR to further potentiate Pt-based chemotherapy and to revert Pt-resistance in EOC and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>TOV-112D parental and Pt-resistant cells were characterized by phosphoproteomics followed by functional analysis and proteins validation by western blot. Synergistic anti-tumor effect was evaluated in Pt-sensitive and Pt-resistant EOC and NSCLC cell lines by calculating combination indexes (CI), colony formation assay, apoptosis and DNA damage, as well as on 3D <i>in vitro<\/i> microtissues obtained by co-culturing cancer cells with normal fibroblasts and <i>in vivo<\/i> EOC and NSCLC xenograft models.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>542 differentially phosphorylated expressed proteins were identified in Pt-resistant TOV-112D compared with parental cells, and mTOR and the transcription factor HSF1 emerged as the most enriched pathways. The up-regulation of the phosphorylated form of PDK1, AKT, mTOR and rpS6 was observed in Pt-resistant compared to parental cells. Moreover, we also demonstrated the up-regulation of the activity of HSF1 along with the elevation of its targets such as heat shock proteins HSP90, HSP70 and HSP40, crucial components of chaperone complex machinery. Interestingly, among the differentially expressed proteins, we identified the kinase DYRK2 able to phosphorylate HSF1, supporting its transactivation. Accordingly, the combination of HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib and the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus plus cisplatin, synergistically reduced colony formation, cancer cells and microtissues cell growth in <i>vitro<\/i> by increasing DNA-damage and apoptosis and <i>in vivo<\/i> by enhancing mouse survival. Mechanistically, the triple combination treatment, impaired the proteins involved in mTOR signalling and HSF1 transactivation. Notably, all these data were confirmed in Pt-resistant NSCLC models, supporting the possibility that the same mechanism is present in different tumor types.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> Our findings identify a promising new antitumor strategy based on the combination of HSP90 and mTOR inhibitors to revert Pt-resistance that that warrant further clinical evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a8284bcb-641a-4aff-bb7b-16efe1317a33\/@C03B8ZEB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Proteomics,Ovarian cancer,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16082"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rita Lombardi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Addi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Biagio Pucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maura Sonego<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Serena Roca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Capone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Iannelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Bruzzese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gustavo Baldassarre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alfredo Budillon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2 (ILF2) is in the 1q21.3 amplified region. The functional role of ILF2 as well as its contribution in promoting an aggressive phenotype in cutaneous metastatic melanoma is unknown.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In silico analyses were performed using the TCGA SKCM dataset with clinical annotations. The results were validated in three melanoma cohort microarray datasets from the GEO database. Melanoma tissues mRNA levels were assessed by RNA in situ hybridization and protein levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Four stable metastatic melanoma cell lines were established for in vitro ILF2 functional characterization.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Our results showed that the ILF2 copy number variation (CNV) is positively correlated with ILF2 mRNA expression (r=0.68, p&#60;0.0001). Additionally, ILF2 mRNA expression significantly increased with melanoma progression (p&#60;0.0001) and is significantly associated with poor overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients (p=0.026). In vitro, ILF2 overexpression (ILF2-OV) enhances cellular proliferation, whereas ILF2 knockdown decreases cellular proliferation by blocking the cell cycle. Mechanistically, we demonstrated the interaction between ILF2 and the splicing factor U2AF2. Reinforcing their functions as a complex, the U2AF2 knockdown reverses the cellular proliferation effects mediated by ILF2-OV. The levels of U2AF2 mRNA and protein levels increased during melanoma progression. Stage IIIB-C melanoma patients with high ILF2-U2AF2 expression showed significantly shorter overall survival (p=0.024). Functional assays showed that enhanced ILF2\/U2AF2 expression promotes a more efficient DNA-damage repair by increasing RAD50 and ATM mRNA expression. Paradoxically, metastatic melanoma cell lines with ILF2-OV were more sensitive to ATM inhibitors.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study uncovered that the ILF2 and U2AF2 complex may have biological implications in controlling the mRNA stability of <i>RAD50<\/i> and <i>ATM<\/i> in metastatic melanoma. Clinically, ILF2 amplification is associated with melanoma progression, triggers a functional downstream pathway in metastatic melanoma that promotes DNA damage repair, and increases the sensitivity to ATM inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4896e7ab-1a41-4f3a-8006-164739846444\/@C03B8ZEB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,U2AF2,ILF2,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16083"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaoqing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Matias A.

As many as 80% of ovarian cancer patients experience recurrent disease and the majority of recurrences become resistant to treatment. Once patients no longer respond to chemotherapy, there are minimal treatment options and they succumb to their disease. Therefore, there is a need to create new targeted therapies to overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer and improve patient survival. We have assembled a tumor microarray from 164 patient tumors to characterize the changes in protein expression that lead to resistance in clinical samples. We have found using IHC staining, that patients with high tyrosine kinase receptor discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) protein expression (&#62;70%) have significantly shorter overall survival times regardless of stage at diagnosis (HR= 2.108, p=0.002) as well as reduced platinum free interval (p=0.046). Additionally, platinum refractory tumors have higher DDR2 protein expression than platinum sensitive tumors (p=0.036). To further understand the mechanisms of chemoresistance, we created a novel, chemoresistant, syngeneic, mouse ovarian cancer cell line derived from ID8 trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup>BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> GFP LUC cells from Walton et. al 2016, and have designated them CHRP5. DDR2 expression assessed via western blot increased significantly in the chemoresistance cells, suggesting that DDR2 is associated with chemoresistance. We knocked down DDR2 using a stable shRNA transfection in CHRP5 and used MTS survival assays to determine if decreased DDR2 expression increases sensitivity to chemotherapy. CHRP5 shDDR2 cells were significantly more sensitive to carboplatin than CHRP5 shControl cells (CHRP5 shControl IC50=213.6uM, CHRP5 shDDR2 IC50=128.5uM, p&#60;0.000001), suggesting that DDR2 is involved in regulating chemoresistance in these cells. Additionally, we have submitted matched chemoresistant and chemosensitive mouse tumor samples for RNA-sequencing. We will use this data to determine which chemoresistant mechanisms are utilized, and if DDR2 is involved in regulating those mechanisms. In the future, we plan to rescue DDR2 in the knockdown cells to confirm that off target effects are not influencing the change in sensitivity. We also have access to a specific, allosteric inhibitor of DDR2 and plan to use this drug to determine if inhibiting DDR2 pharmacologically can overcome chemoresistance and reduce tumor burden <i>in vivo <\/i>and <i>in vitro<\/i>. In conclusion, DDR2 is more highly expressed in chemoresistant patients, and higher DDR2 expression correlates with reduced survival and platinum free interval. Additionally, knocking down DDR2 in chemoresistant cells increases sensitivity to chemotherapy. Therefore, DDR2 is a potential new target for ovarian cancer therapy and may be targeted to overcome chemoresistant disease and extend patient survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c5ad9b9-50d6-4856-9648-b31729e8c937\/@C03B8ZEB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Chemoresistance,Mouse models,Platinum drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16086"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alyssa Oplt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Stock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hollie Noia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Cannon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Longmore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine C.

Recent treatment advances include the use of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for recurrent tumors with associated BRCA mutations. While maintenance treatment with PARP inhibitors results in remission for a significant number of patients, acquired resistance to therapy has been observed. In this study, we evaluated biomarkers associated with resistance to the PARP inhibitor Olaparib in a cohort of platinum pretreated Ovarian Cancer tumors.

PARPi have proved efficacy in breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, particularly in HR-deficient tumors, while their activity is limited in HR-proficient tumors. However, PARPi resistance is inevitable and therapeutic resistance resulting from restoration of HR repair is a pressing clinical problem. Identifying combination treatments to sensitize tumors cells to PARPi and\/or overcome PARPi resistance is critical to expand the benefit of these therapies. The Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a serine threonine kinase, is a master regulator of mitosis, overexpressed in many cancers. PLK1 is also involved in the DNA damage response through the promotion of HR-mediated DNA repair and the recovery from the G2\/M checkpoint. PLK1 roles in HR repair suggest that PLK1 inhibition may reverse PARPi resistance.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To test the effect of PLK1 and PARP inhibitors combination, we used onvansertib, a highly selective, ATP-competitor PLK1 inhibitor currently in clinical development and the FDA-approved PARPi olaparib. The antitumor effect of the single and combined drug treatments was tested in 2 <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patient derived (PDX) models resistant to olaparib. Orthotopically PDX transplanted mice were treated for 4 weeks and followed for survival.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The combination of onvansertib and olaparib was well tolerated and showed strong anti-tumor activity in both PDX models. The combination significantly increased mice survival in comparison to vehicle, olaparib and onvansertib, and showed that onvansertib can re-sensitize PARPi-resistant tumors to olaparib. Median survival increased by 2.7-fold and 8.1-fold respectively in the 2 PDX models in the combination group versus vehicle and the Kaplan Meyer survival curves of mice treated with the combination showed a statistically survival advantage versus control and single agent treated mice. Pharmacodynamic analyses showed an increase in mitotic, apoptotic and DNA damage markers in tumors treated with the combination versus vehicle.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The combination of the PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib and the PARPi olaparib showed potent anti-tumor activity in olaparib-resistant <i>BRAC1 <\/i>mutant HGSOC PDX models. Additional studies are ongoing to further assess the potential of the combination in <i>BRCA <\/i>wild-type and mutant ovarian, prostate, pancreatic and breast cancer preclinical models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cbd53758-c2e0-4af3-9b2e-cb2e0a06fa3a\/@C03B8ZEB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,PARP inhibitors,Polo-like kinase,Resistance to olaparib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16088"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Michela Chiappa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Guffanti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandra Decio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Aliverti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Ricci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eugenio Scanziani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Camin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilaria Craparotta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Chiara Barbera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Bolis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maya Ridinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Giovanna Damia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Temozolomide (TMZ) is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for glioblastoma, but the emergence of drug resistance limits its anti-tumor activity. We previously discovered that the interferon inducible guanylate binding protein 3 (GBP3) is highly elevated and promotes tumorigenicity of glioblastoma. Here, we show that TMZ treatment significantly upregulates the expression of GBP3 and stimulator of interferon genes (STING), both of which increase TMZ-induced DNA damage repair and reduce cell apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. Mechanistically, relying on its N-terminal GTPase domain, GBP3 physically interacts with STING to stabilize STING protein levels, which in turn induces expression of p62 (Sequestosome 1), nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2, NRF2), and O6-methlyguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), leading to the resistance to TMZ treatment. Reducing GBP3 levels by RNA interference in glioblastoma cells markedly increases the sensitivity to TMZ treatment in vitro and in murine glioblastoma models. Clinically, GBP3 expression is high and positively correlated with STING, NRF2, p62, and MGMT expression in human glioblastoma tumors, and is associated with poor outcomes. These findings provide novel insight into TMZ resistance and suggest that GBP3 may represent a novel potential target for the treatment of glioblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c5b9a536-5173-44fa-a5b8-fa2b8676238d\/@D03B8ZEC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Temozolomide,GTPase,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16089"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ming Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Xu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Even though most of the patients suffer from non-invasive lesions, around 70% will recur following surgical intervention. Chemotherapy with gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin is a common treatment option for recurrent disease, however 60% of the patients will relapse due to resistance. Gemcitabine (2&#8217;,2&#8217;-difluoro 2&#8217;-deoxycytidine) is classified as an antimetabolite, is commonly administered to BCa patients. This DNA synthesis inhibitor, is also used to treat pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer patients. Having lower relative toxicity, BCa patients are given gemcitabine as a single agent for intravesical therapy. Resistance mechanisms for gemcitabine have been reported to involve Hedgehog, Wnt, and Notch, signaling as potential means of cancer stem cell programming dependent on the tumor type. In examining mechanisms of resistance, we identified ketone body metabolism to be important. OXCT1, a rate-limiting enzyme in ketone metabolism, was found to be highly associated with bladder cancer death - Hoglund et al. P = 2.3x10<sup>-3<\/sup> and TCGA, P = 6.5x10<sup>-4<\/sup>. We measured the expression of OXCT1 in RT4, UMUC3, T24 and 5637 bladder cancer cell lines and observed that expression correlated with gemcitabine resistance. The generation of gemcitabine resistance of otherwise sensitive 5637 cells (5637GR) resulted in elevation of OXCT1. Conversely, the CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout of OXCT1 was able to sensitize inherently resistant UMUC3 and generated 5637GR lines. Given that OXCT1 is a rate limiting enzyme in ketone metabolism, we evaluated oxygen consumption rate finding increase metabolic activity. Furthermore we evaluated stemness through sphere forming assays (hanging drop and forced floating methods) to reveal that the OXCT1-KO lines had reduced spheres compared to their parental lines. Keeping in mind that several developmental processes were altered in 5637GR and restored to parental levels in the 5637GR-OXCT1-KO, we evaluated the transcriptomic differences in the cell types to determine the mechanism that led to the metabolic changes induced by gemcitabine resistance. master regulator analysis that revealed three key transcription factors (TFs), TBX2, SOX15 and OVOL1. Analysis of the downstream targets of the three master regulators in the TCGA BCa data (n = 408), the Peter C. Black neoadjuvant chemotherapy data (n = 134) and the Hoglund muscle invasive data (n = 308) demonstrated that OVOL1 is highly associated with recurrence. Moreover, downstream targets of OVOL1 are involved in fatty acid metabolism, survival and differentiation. These data links ketone metabolism and stemness. Additionally, it opens the door for targets in gemcitabine treatment","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d303e58-7b77-4ef3-95c4-3f26d98eb593\/@D03B8ZEC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Chemoresistance,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16090"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Krizia Rohena Rivera<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sungyoung You<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minhyung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandrine Billet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johanna Hoeve-Scott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabrielle Gonzales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chengqun Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Heard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil A.

It is known that IC50 of a given therapeutic agent is dependent on the seeding density of the treated cells (in that more densely-seeded cells tend to be more resistant to therapeutic agents). We performed experiments using the CellTiter Glo cell viability assay to assess the cytotoxicity of various chemotherapeutic drugs towards various cancer cell lines. To elucidate the role the extracellular environment of densely-seeded cells plays in cancer cell chemoresistance, we tested conditioned media from cells cultured at high density on cells seeded at low densities. The resulting impact on the IC50 of the low-density cells was determined. The IC50 of the various therapeutic agents tested was cell density-dependent in each cancer cell line examined. Based on this analysis, we propose the IC50-seeding density slope (ISDS), which relates seeding density to the effectiveness of a drug and that we believe could be a standardized quantitative measurement of how a given cancer cell line responds to a given therapeutic treatment. Our results from the conditioned media experiments consistently indicated that the environment of densely-seeded tumor cells conferred chemoresistance to sparsely-seeded cells, suggesting that extracellular cytokines and growth factors may be involved in density-dependent chemoresistance mechanisms. We are currently exploring the effect of serum deprivation on <i>in vitro<\/i> chemoresistance, in order to further understand how the presence of extracellular nutrients impacts observed IC50 trends. In addition, we are examining the role that cell-cell contact, integrin and FGF signaling pathways play in giving rise to density-dependent chemoresistance. Moreover, to analyze the manner in which conditioned media gives rise to chemoresistance and how this effect relates to intracellular survival pathways, we are performing cytokine profiling experiments. Overall, we describe density-dependent IC50 variations as a hallmark of cancer cells and propose that ISDS may serve as a standardized method of assessing chemosensitivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/662cd313-66b7-44bb-8556-9ef2721c9083\/@D03B8ZEC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Assay development,Chemoresistance,In vitro,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16092"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ujwal Punyamurtula<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shengliang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arielle De La Cruz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Raufi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jillian Strandberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsey Carlsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lanlan Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wafik El-Deiry<\/i><\/presenter>.

The dismal 5-year survival rate is partly due to late-stage diagnosis. MEK inhibition therapy has been approved by FDA as treatment option for several cancer types. Recently, trametinib has achieved significantly better objective response rate than traditional standard of care therapies in patients with recurrent low-grade ovarian serous cancer (LGOSC). However, adaptive resistance to MEK inhibitors is common and the mechanism is still unclear. To further investigate the mechanism of adaptive resistance, we have established several adaptive trametinib resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Our result showed that SERPINE1 was significantly induced in a LGOSC cell line, HOC-7, after acquiring trametinib resistance. To determine the role of SERPINE1 in trametinib resistance in LGOSC, overexpression and down-regulation of SERPINE1 in HOC-7 were achieved by transfection with a cDNA clone expressing SERPINE1 and siRNA silencing respectively. The association of SERPINE1 with trametinib resistance was also investigated in a LGOSC mouse model. For <i>in vitro<\/i> studies, HOC-7 overexpressing SERPINE1 had a 5-fold increase in IC50 to trametinib in comparison to the parental control cell line HOC-7. Furthermore, pERK expression was also up-regulated in HOC-7 overexpressing SERPINE1. By knocking down the expression of SERIPINE1 in trametinib adaptive resistant HOC-7 cells transfected with SERPINE1 siRNA, we found that the cell proliferation was partly reduced in comparison to cells transfected with control siRNA. More importantly, the trametinib adaptive resistant cells became more sensitive to trametinib. For <i>in vivo<\/i> studies with the LGOSC mouse model, we found that SERPINE1 expression increased after trametinib treatment in LGOSC tumor tissue. Interestingly, the expression of SERPINE1 protein was found to be correlated to ERK phosphorylation in tumor tissues. Furthermore, the measurement of plasma SERPINE1 in LGOSC mouse model and cancer patient revealed that SERPINE1 could be a predictive marker in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The above observations were further supported by CCLE and TCGA data that <i>SERPINE1<\/i> gene expression level correlated with trametinib sensitivity and patient survival. In conclusion, SERPINE1 could facilitate trametinib resistance by ERK phosphorylation, and this protein has the potential to be a therapeutic target, diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for LGOSC. Further analysis by RNA-seq and immunohistochemical staining of trametinib-treated mouse tumor samples will be performed to understand the mechanism of MEK inhibitor adaptive resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed86e2eb-33fd-4f1d-ba5a-3bc8d62af94b\/@D03B8ZEC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MEK inhibitor,Cancer cell,Mouse models,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16093"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chun Wai Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yvonne TM Tsang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David M.

With a 5-year survival rate of 6.8% and a median observed survival time of only 8 months, recurrent glioblastoma is among the world&#8217;s most lethal malignancies. Temozolomide (TMZ) has become a standard chemotherapeutic for glioblastoma due to its alkylating effects and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Unfortunately, many patients with glioblastoma develop resistance to TMZ, severely limiting therapeutic options. Recent studies have found a link between ectopic connexin 43 (Cx43) and TMZ-resistant glioblastoma. Further studies have shown success in overcoming this resistance by combining TMZ with alpha carboxyl terminus 1 (&#945;CT1) peptide, a clinically tested Cx43 carboxyl terminus mimetic peptide inhibitor; however, because of the short half-life of &#945;CT1, therapeutic potential is limited, and new approaches are needed. In this study, we hypothesized that simultaneously targeting Cx43 with &#945;CT1 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) using PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors would synergistically sensitize glioblastoma to TMZ treatment because p110&#946;, one of the four PI3K catalytic subunits, is a prime survival factor for TMZ-resistant glioblastoma. We cultured newly dissected primary glioblastoma cells, glioblastoma cell lines, and glioblastoma stem cells and dosed them with various combinations of &#945;CT1, TMZ, and one of two clinically tested p110&#946; inhibitors (TGX-221 or GSK2636771). Cell viability was measured using an MTS viability assay. Glioblastoma cells that expressed high levels of Cx43 and p110&#946; experienced a significant decrease in viability when dosed with a triple combination. The additive properties of these combinations were measured using an excess over Bliss (EOB) score derived from Bliss independence modeling, which showed synergistic effects as high as 81% for triple therapy combinations in TMZ-resistant cell lines. The EOB was significantly higher in triple therapies than the double or single therapies. To support our findings, we used the same combinations in primary glioblastoma cells and measured the activity of cleaved caspase 3\/7 using a luminescence assay. There was a synergistic increase in caspase 3\/7 activity in the triple therapy that was not seen in any of the other combinations. Identical treatment in non-pathological human astrocytes suggests that our drug combinations do not exacerbate non-selective TMZ toxicity in the brain. Collectively, our data demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of Cx43 and PI3K is an effective approach for overcoming TMZ resistance in glioblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eb63dbb6-9ad9-4467-9214-69d3145cbbd2\/@D03B8ZEC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Temozolomide,Resistance,PI3K,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16095"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kasen R.

More than half of HGSOC is characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) due to mutations in genes involved in this pathway, including <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>. Olaparib is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) recently approved in front line and maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive <i>BRCA<\/i> mutated ovarian cancer patients. Despite olaparib clinical benefits, this treatment is associated with the development of resistance. A better understanding of the mechanisms at its basis could help in finding strategies to delay or overcome\/counteract it, possibly translatable in the clinical setting.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We generated an olaparib resistant cell line (BRCA1-\/- OlaR), starting from the BRCA1 and TP53 deleted murine ID8 cells (BRCA1-\/-) by step wise increasing drug concentrations. Sensitive and resistant cell lines were biologically and pharmacologically characterized and the molecular mechanisms at the basis of olaparib resistance investigated. Cellular viability was assessed by MTS assay, for molecular studies real-time PCR, western blot and RAD51-foci immunofluorescence were performed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>BRCA1-\/- OlaR cells were 24 fold time more resistant than BRCA1-\/- cells and displayed a similar <i>in vitro<\/i> cell growth compared to the parental cells. Olaparib treatment at IC50 dose caused a longer and stronger G2-M block of the cell cycle in sensitive as compared to resistant cells. BRCA1-\/- OlaR cells were cross-resistant to the other PARPis tested, suggesting a common mechanism of resistance. Platinum compounds showed similar cytotoxic activity in sensitive and resistant cells, while a partial cross-resistance was observed with doxorubicin. Interestingly, resistant cells were less responsive to a panel of DNA damage response (DDR) inhibitors (i.e. ATR, WEE1 and CHK1 inhibitors) compared to parental ones; however their combinations with olaparib were synergic in both the sensitive and resistant lines. A partial restoration of the HR pathway (increase in RAD51 foci formation after olaparib and IR treatment), a downregulation of PARP1 protein levels without mutation in PARP1 gene and an upregulation of the MDR transcript could be found in BRCA1-\/- resistant cells, strongly supporting multiple heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance. <b>Conclusions: <\/b>The HR deficient cell line resistant to olaparib we generated showed multiple mechanisms of resistance.

In particular, the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and constitutive activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase\/ protein kinase B (PI3K\/AKT) pathway are common aberrations in head and neck cancer. However, intrinsic and acquired resistance are continuously posing challenges to success. Previously, we reported that the combination of EGFR inhibitor erlotinib with PI3K inhibitor BKM120 had synergistic effects that induced efficient apoptosis in a panel of head and neck cancer cell lines, but some cells were still resistant.

Therefore, understanding the molecular basis for chemoresistance is essential for novel therapeutic advancement and improving patient outcome. The Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) tumor suppressor is lost in up to 70% of sporadic breast cancer; however, little is known about how APC loss contributes to chemoresistance. Using mammary tumor cells isolated from the <i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>mouse crossed to the Polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) transgenic model, we made the novel observation that APC loss decreased doxorubicin (DOX) induced apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the mechanisms contributing to DOX resistance with APC loss to identify combination therapy options. We previously showed that APC loss in MMTV-PyMT;<i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>cells activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) thereby increasing the expression of the drug efflux pump, multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1). ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as MDR1, are well established to contribute to drug resistance through exporting drugs from the cell. Furthermore, tumor initiating cells (TICs) have increased expression of ABC transporters and are known to be chemoresistant. We showed that MMTV-PyMT;<i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>cells have an increased TIC population. In addition, decreased intracellular DOX accumulation was observed in APC-deficient cells suggesting enhanced drug efflux. To investigate this decreased intracellular DOX accumulation, we measured the expression and activity of the drug export pumps, MDR1 and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1). Using a small molecule inhibitor (Valspodar), we found that MDR1 inhibition restored the DOX-induced cleaved caspase 3 expression, demonstrating that MDR1 contributes to DOX resistance. MDR1 inhibition also increased the intracellular DOX accumulation in the APC-deficient cells and reduced the TICs. Genetic manipulation to silence MRP1 also increased DOX-induced apoptosis, increased DOX accumulation, and decreased the TICs in MMTV-PyMT;<i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>cells. To target both MDR1 and MRP1, a small molecule inhibitor (Reversan) was used to see if affecting both would offer more benefit. We again found that Reversan restored DOX sensitivity in MMTV-PyMT;<i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>cells through increasing DOX accumulation and decreasing TICs. Future studies include using a panel of human breast cancer cell lines to determine correlation of APC expression and DOX sensitivity. In addition, we will also evaluate patient tumor protein lysates for APC, MDR1, and MRP1 expression, followed by correlation studies to determine whether expression of APC inversely correlates with MDR1 or MRP1. Taken together, APC loss mediates DOX resistance via increasing DOX export and the TIC population demonstrating the potential use of combination therapy to overcome chemoresistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d399b5f9-6f7c-49ec-bdd3-33b09b647889\/@D03B8ZEC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"APC,ABC transporters,Doxorubicin,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16099"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Casey D.

BMH-21 is a first-in-class small molecule that inhibits Pol I transcription and induces degradation of the enzyme. This approach is effective across many cancer types. However, a heterogeneous response was observed in cancer cell lines emphasizing the need to increase knowledge of factors that underlie the response to this therapeutic strategy. To identify genes that modulate the response of cancer cells to BMH-21, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based positive selection screens in human colorectal carcinoma cells. These screens identified high-confidence hits accounting for BMH-21 drug resistance that included all key positive regulators of the mTORC1 complex. Given that p53 has been identified as a downstream effector of Pol I transcription stress, we conducted the screens in <i>TP53 <\/i>isogenic cells. Notably, the mTORC1 pathway hits were identified in all screens indicating that the resistance was p53 independent. These findings are particularly striking given that mTOR is a major driver of ribosome biogenesis and cellular translational programs. The findings were validated using chemical and genetic approaches. Torin-1, a catalytic mTOR inhibitor, was found to cause resistance to BMH-21. mTOR signaling pathway knockout and rescue cell lines were generated and tested for changes in the drug responses by growth, viability, colony formation and GFP competition assays. In each case, compromised mTOR activity led to resistance to BMH-21. However, compromised mTOR activity did not abrogate Pol I transcription inhibition by BMH-21. To assess impact on protein translation, we used polysome profiling. BMH-21 treatment was found to cause a severe ribosome biogenesis defect. Surprisingly, mTOR inactivation partially rescued the translation ability under the drug treatment suggesting that this translation is pivotal for cell survival. To uncover factors critical for the survival, we performed Ribo-seq and RNA-seq in the drug-treated BMH-21 sensitive and resistant cells. The profiling results revealed that mTOR inactivation led to elevated translation efficiency of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins. These findings suggest that mTOR inactivation evokes compensatory selective translation of ribosomal proteins under severe ribosome biogenesis defect caused by the Pol I inhibition. The findings indicate that mTOR inactivation regulates selective translation as means to bypass Pol I inhibition, and more generally, that maintenance of translational capacity strongly contributes to treatment resistance. These findings reveal an unexpected complication by mTOR inhibitory strategies as well as have implications on exploring drug combinations in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5340ce73-1f50-4f12-97b5-d3f7e9675b3e\/@D03B8ZEC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Therapeutic target,Translation,mTOR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16100"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wenjun Fan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hester Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Pitts<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brittany Ford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajeshkumar NV<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marikki Laiho<\/i><\/presenter>.

EGFR is an attractive therapeutic target due to its mutational frequency and availability of brain-penetrant tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Several EGFR TKI have failed clinically, due in part to acquired resistance. To mechanistically examine this type of resistance, we used a panel of ten genetically engineered mouse astrocyte lines harboring <i>Cdkn2a<\/i> deletion and EGFRvIII, a common (~30%) activating mutation. Resistant cells were generated via long-term exposure to gefitinib or erlotinib, either <i>in vitro <\/i>or <i>in vivo<\/i>. Both transcriptomic (RNAseq) and proteomic (multiplexed inhibitor beads with mass spectrometry, MIB-MS) experiments showed that cell lines clustered primarily by resistance phenotype and secondarily by method of resistance development when analyzed using principal component analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Kinases involved in proliferation and differentiation signaling pathways (ex: Pdgfrb, Pdk2, Tnik, Mapk3, Fgfr2) were upregulated in both RNAseq and MIB-MS datasets and thus represent putative druggable targets for dual kinase inhibition. Analysis of commonly upregulated kinases and their commercially available inhibitors revealed dovitinib and dasatinib, two brain-penetrant drugs approved for other cancer indications, as candidates for dual inhibition with an EGFR TKI. Resistant cell lines were all more sensitive to dovitinib than their drug-na&#239;ve parents; however, sensitivity to dasatinib varied. BLISS analysis of dual treatment with EGFR TKI neratinib and dasatinib or dovitinib revealed synergistic drug interactions in most lines. Additionally, drug-na&#239;ve cells displayed a robust, acute proteomic response to EGFR TKI afatinib over 48h, while the response of resistant lines was significantly blunted. This model system can also be used to examine acute vs. long-term kinome response to EGFR TKI. Acute response was examined by treating drug-na&#239;ve cells with afatinib over 48h, and long-term kinome rewiring was observed by comparing untreated cells to gefitinib- and erlotinib-resistant cell lines. Combing both RNAseq datasets for kinases upregulated in both drug-na&#239;ve cells over a 48h EGFR TKI treatment course and in resistant cell lines compared to their sensitive parents reveals 21 and 13 common kinases, respectively, at p&#60;0.001. Eight of these kinases (Cdk19, Ddr1, Kalrn, Khk, Mapk3, Pink1, Tnik, Ulk2) appear in both the <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>datasets, indicating a conserved kinome response regardless of method of resistance generation. Overall, integrated kinome profiling in GBM models with defined mutational profiles provides a powerful framework to identify novel therapeutic targets that could significantly alter current treatment paradigms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8e3af255-4d3e-4053-9cc1-2f75e200840b\/@D03B8ZEC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Drug resistance,RNA sequencing,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16101"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Abigail K.

However, most patients with advanced cancer eventually acquire resistance to PARPi, and the mechanisms by which tumors escape PARPi therapy are still not fully understood. Here, we report that treatment with the PARPi olaparib induces the formation of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines (Hey, SKOV3, MCF-7), three human high-grade serous cancer (HGSC)-derived organoids, and HGSC patient-derived xenografts. Live-cell fluorescence time-lapse tracking of ovarian cancer cells labeled with FUCCI (fluorescent ubiquitination cell-cycle indicator) or histone H2B-mCherry\/&#945;-tubulin-EGFP revealed that PGCCs primarily developed from the endoreplication of diploid cancer cells after exposure to sublethal concentrations of olaparib. PGCCs exhibited markers of senescent cells; however, they were able to escape senescence to generate mitotically competent daughter cells via budding, multipolar mitosis, and acytokinetic mitosis following olaparib withdrawal. PGCCs and derived daughter cells conferred resistance to olaparib-induced cytotoxicity, which could be blocked by the anti-progesterone drug mifepristone. Whole transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing of ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer-derived organoids showed activation of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype with upregulated cytokines and chemokines and downregulation of MYC signaling in PGCCs. Mifepristone\/olaparib combination therapy significantly mitigated tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft models with acquired resistance to olaparib. Thus, targeting of PGCCs may represent a promising approach to overcome PARPi resistance in recurrent ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7bcf3e7-afe3-4222-8792-c1797662707f\/@E03B8ZED\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,PARP inhibitors,Senescence,time-lapse Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16102"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xudong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoran Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Niu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anil K.

Chemoresistance (drug resistance) of tumors is the primary reason for the failure of chemotherapy and a major cause of mortality in colon cancer. The molecular mechanisms involved in chemoresistance or methods to chemosensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy remain elusive. Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota and microbial metabolites play a crucial role in the development and progression of colon cancer. Urolithin A (UroA) is a gut microbial metabolite derived from ellagitannin\/ellagic acid rich-diets such as pomegranate and berries. Here, we identified that UroA and its novel structural analogue (UAS03) chemosensitize 5FU resistant (5FUR) colon cancer cells to 5FU treatment. Our data suggested that combination of 5FU with UroA or UAS03 significantly reduced cell viability of 5FUR colon cancer cell lines with combination index (CI) less than 1 suggesting their synergism. Moreover, UroA or UAS03 in combination with 5FU significantly inhibited 5FUR colon cancer cell proliferation, migration as well as induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, UroA or UAS03 treatment down regulated drug transporters (MDR1, BCRP and MRP2) leading to decreased efflux of drug (e.g., 5FU) and potentially responsible for chemosensitization. Furthermore, treatment with these compounds also modulated EMT makers (e.g., downregulated Snail and &#946;-catenin; upregulated ZO-1 and E-cadherin) to reduce EMT transition. Treatment of UroA or UAS03 in combination with 5FU significantly reduced the growth of 5FUR-tumor xenografts in NRGS mice. Taken together, utilization of UroA or UAS03 in combination with 5FU treatment may provide better therapeutic options for 5FUR colon cancer alleviation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/697c2b54-ae41-4e49-b5da-58f9de29fd37\/@E03B8ZED\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Microbial Metabolite,Drug resistance,Chemosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16103"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sweta Ghosh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajbir Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary M.

Developing targeted therapies for HNSCC is challenging as the genomic landscape is dominated by mutations in tumor suppressors, including <i>NOTCH1<\/i>. To address this need, we previously demonstrated that PI3K inhibition led to apoptosis in <i>NOTCH1<\/i> mutant HNSCC cell lines. The underlying mechanism of this sensitivity is unknown and important to elucidate as modest responses and development of acquired resistance are the leading causes of failure for targeted therapies. To address this knowledge gap, we measured the levels of 304 proteins using reverse phase protein array in <i>NOTCH1<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> and <i>NOTCH1<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i> HNSCC cell lines upon PI3K inhibition and identified Aurora kinase B (AURKB) to be differentially regulated. We also identified AURKB levels to be maintained in the <i>NOTCH1<\/i><sup>MUT<\/sup> cell lines with acquired resistance to PI3K inhibition. To determine if the maintenance of AURKB expression contributes to PI3K inhibitor resistance, we depleted AURKB in resistant <i>NOTCH1<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> HNSCC cells and overexpressed AURKB in sensitive <i>NOTCH1<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i> HNSCC cells. This manipulation of AURKB levels led to increased sensitivity and resistance to PI3K inhibition respectively. To use a pharmacologic approach, we combined the pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor danusertib (0-2&#181;M) with PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor omipalisib (0-200nM) in 56 HNSCC cell lines for 72h and observed a substantial decrease in cell viability in &#62;80% of <i>NOTCH1<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> and &#62;90% of <i>NOTCH1<sup>MUT<\/sup> <\/i>HNSCC lines. Additionally, concurrent Aurora kinase and PI3K inhibition in <i>NOTCH1<sup>WT<\/sup>, NOTCH1<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i>, and<i> NOTCH1<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i> acquired resistant HNSCC cells for 24h resulted in elevated cell death compared to single agents, as measured by the induction of cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase 3; and Annexin V positive cells. Mice bearing <i>NOTCH1<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i> xenografts showed complete tumor regression when treated with a combination of pan-PI3K inhibitor Copanlisib and Aurora inhibitor Alisertib as compared to control groups. AURKB depletion in <i>NOTCH1<sup>WT <\/sup><\/i>and overexpression in <i>NOTCH1<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i> HNSCC cells revealed significant changes in the total protein levels of AKT and PDK1. Similarly, AKT depletion and overexpression in <i>NOTCH1<sup>WT <\/sup><\/i>and <i>NOTCH1<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i> HNSCC cells altered sensitivity to PI3K inhibition. However, manipulation of AKT levels affected PDK1 and not AURKB levels, demonstrating AURKB to be upstream to AKT and PDK1. Therefore, maintenance of AURKB levels mediates resistance to PI3K inhibition in HNSCC through AKT and PDK1. We identified AURKB as a central player governing the sensitivity to PI3K inhibitor-induced apoptosis in the context of <i>NOTCH1 <\/i>mutation status in HNSCC through its effects on AKT and PDK1. These novel findings may lead to the development of more robust therapeutic approach for <i>NOTCH1<\/i> mutant squamous carcinoma as well as patients who develop acquired resistance to targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/00987515-5608-4c86-a460-92d28536164a\/@E03B8ZED\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,NOTCH1,PI3K inhibitors,Aurora kinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16104"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pooja A.

How TTFields exert efficacy on cancer cells over normal cells, or interact with TMZ is unclear. Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles triggered by extracellular ligands, mechanical and electrical field stimulation, and are capable of promoting cancer growth and TMZ chemoresistance. We found in both low and high grade patient glioma cell lines that TTFields ablated cilia within 24 hours. Halting TTFields treatment led to recovered frequencies of elongated cilia. Cilia on normal primary astrocytes, neurons and multiciliated ependymal cells were less affected by TTFields. The TTFields-mediated loss of glioma cilia was partially rescued by chloroquine pretreatment, suggesting the effect is in part due to autophagy activation. We also observed death of ciliated cells during TTFields by live imaging. Notably, TMZ-induced stimulation of ciliogenesis in both adherent cells and gliomaspheres was blocked by TTFields. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of TTFields and TMZ on tumor cell recurrence correlated with the relative timing of TMZ exposure to TTFields and ARL13B positive cilia. Finally, TTFields disrupted cilia in patient tumors treated ex vivo. Our findings suggest TTFields efficacy may depend on the degree of tumor ciliogenesis and relative timing of TMZ treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d1613c29-906d-466e-b8ef-933d5418f9a0\/@E03B8ZED\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Temozolomide,Tumor biology,Glioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16105"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ping Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jia Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brittany Ulm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julianne Mallinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Habibeh Khoshbouei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loic Deleyrolle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Matthew Sarkisian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

More information is emerging regarding the role of RBBP6 in cancer treatment, specifically its potential to sensitize cancer cells to radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents via BCL-2 gene regulation. Cisplatin is an FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agent that still presents with acquired resistance in certain cervical cancer cases through p53 repression and BCL-2 upregulation, which is why there is ongoing research in trying to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of cervical cancer cells to this drug. The present study therefore aims to investigate the possible relationship between cisplatin and RBBP6 expression in cervical cancer cells. RBBP6 was silenced in Hela, CaSki and Vero cells using the RNAi technology, followed by measurement of wild-type p53 and BCL-2 at mRNA level using qPCR. Cells co-treated with cisplatin and siRBBP6 were therefore analyzed for apoptosis induction and real time growth monitoring using flow cytometry and the xCELLigence system, respectively. Cancer cells in the co-treatment group showed a reduction in apoptosis compared to cisplatin-only group and real time growth monitoring revealed a reduced growth rate in RBBP6-knockdown cells treated with cisplatin. Although wild-type p53 remained unchanged in the co-treatment group of cancer cells, BCL-2 was completely repressed, suggesting that RBBP6 is necessary for the responsiveness of cervical cancer cells to via BCL-2 downregulation. Findings from this study suggest that <i>RBBP6<\/i> expression promotes sensitivity of HeLa cells to cisplatin through BCL-2 downregulation. Knockdown of <i>RBBP6<\/i> limits apoptosis induction and delays cell growth inhibition in response to cisplatin. The knowledge obtained here has the potential to help improve cisplatin efficacy through personalized administration based on the expression profile of RBBP6 among individual patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/007aba14-a49a-42bb-9a48-78839793306d\/@E03B8ZED\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Retinoblastoma protein,Cisplatin,Gene silencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16106"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"51949aa7-d2c7-4b69-84c5-7ed9e4ffe446","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/51949aa7-d2c7-4b69-84c5-7ed9e4ffe446\/@E03B8ZED\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pontsho Moela<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harshini Mehta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melvin Ambele<\/i><\/presenter>.

Tumor biopsies at baseline and at disease progression were analyzed with whole exome\/genome sequencing (WES\/WGS), transcriptomics (RNA sequencing) and proteomics. Genomic variants were analyzed together with changes in protein expression. Three filtering steps were used to identify potential resistance mechanisms from the proteomics measurements. Proteins were filtered for 1) proteins with a high shift in abundance between baseline and progression 2) proteins with known associations to the patient&#8217;s primary cancer based on text-mining and 3) proteins in pathways where BRAF is also involved.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Alterations conferring resistance were identified in 2 out of 9 patients when comparing data from WES\/WGS and RNA sequencing at baseline and at disease progression (one patient with <i>PTBP2-BRAF<\/i> fusion and one with <i>NRAS <\/i>mutation). Genomic or transcriptomic alterations conferring resistance were not detected in the remaining 7 patients. Notably, there was not a single protein shared between all 9 patients after our filtering, but when comparing overlap on pathway level, six pathways related to RAF and MAPK signaling were affected in all 9 patients. Particularly, paradoxical activation of RAF signaling seems to be an interesting candidate to explain resistance, where formation of RAF dimer structures happens as a response to treatment with BRAF inhibitors, selectively inhibiting BRAF monomer structures (i.e. BRAFV600E).<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Conclusion:<\/b> With a multiomic approach using proteomics together with genomics and transcriptomics, potential mechanisms of resistance were detected in all patients at disease progression, where resistance to BRAF targeted therapies had occurred. Six mechanisms of resistance were shared independently of diagnosis and BRAF inhibitor combination regimes. The potential of integrating proteomics with genomics and transcriptomics is promising and may potentially guide therapy for future patients with treatment resistant BRAFV600E mutated solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/af5217ee-f28c-4b9b-a6ff-02942afb16da\/@E03B8ZED\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Multiomics,Drug resistance,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16126"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Martina Eriksen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annelaura Bach Nielsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filip Mundt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josephine Kerzel Duel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Mann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrik Lassen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Westmose Yde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camilla Qvortrup<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Højgaard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iben Spanggaard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristoffer Staal Rohrberg<\/i><\/presenter>.

While KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors deliver clinical benefit, most patients who achieved an objective response ultimately progressed. Recent insights into clinical KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor resistance identified reactivation of the RAS\/MAPK pathway as a common putative driver mechanism of resistance. Multiple ongoing trials seek to augment responses to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors through rational combination strategies, including the pan-KRAS SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963. Here we use different preclinical experimental approaches to interrogate KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor resistance mechanisms with the aim to identify strategies to overcome resistance. To predict on-target resistance, Ba\/F3 cells were transduced with <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>, ENU-mutagenized and chronically exposed to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors. Resistant clones were screened for secondary KRAS mutations, highlighting that <i>KRAS G12C\/Y96D<\/i> and <i>Y96S<\/i> cis mutations did confer resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition but could be overcome by MEK inhibitor combination with a SOS1 inhibitor. As second strategy a high-complexity single site variant library of <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> encompassing all possible secondary <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations was employed to establish Ba\/F3 transgenic cell pools. The response of this <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> Ba\/F3 clone library harboring a comprehensive set of secondary mutations was tested following treatment with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors alone and in combination with a pan-KRAS SOS1 inhibitor. In parallel, acquired KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor resistance was generated in solid cancer cells following long-term MRTX849 treatment. Clones were characterized and their response to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition and combination therapy was analyzed. Both in the Ba\/F3 cell pool as well as in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor resistant clones combining SOS1 inhibition to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition proved to be beneficial. Finally, bringing these findings in vivo, SW837(CRC) tumor-bearing mice were long-term treated with adagrasib until tumors relapsed after initial regression and resistant tumors were randomized for second line treatments. In this KRASG12C&#8239;inhibitor&#8239;resistant context, treatment with adagrasib plus cetuximab resulted in tumor stasis and adagrasib plus SOS1i resulted in&#8239;tumor regression. While more work is currently being undertaken to map the resistance mechanisms in both our <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> settings, all results highlight the benefit of combining a SOS1 inhibitor with a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor to prevent and\/or overcome acquired resistance. The pan-KRAS SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 is the first direct RAS signaling modifier in phase I clinical trials both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors, MEK inhibitors and liposomal irinotecan.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/329528ee-a2c6-45b1-baa5-aa1f6eff07d9\/@E03B8ZED\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Resistance,KRASG12C,SOS1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16129"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marco H.
