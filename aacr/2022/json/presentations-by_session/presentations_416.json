[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Missense mutations of the <i>TP53<\/i> gene frequently occur in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. The functional consequences of mutant p53 expression on hematopoiesis remain incompletely studied. Whether <i>TP53<\/i> mutations confer a loss-of-function, gain-of-function, or dominant-negative effect in response to chemotherapies has not been fully explored. One of these hotspot mutations is a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 525 of <i>TP53<\/i>, which codes for an Arg175His (R175H) substitution. Thus, we characterized hematopoiesis in <i>Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup> <\/i>constitutive knock-in mice, corresponding to R175H <i>TP53<\/i> mutation in patients, and compared the results to <i>Trp53 <\/i>knock-out and control mice.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Five genotypes of mice were analyzed (<i>Trp53<sup>+\/+ <\/sup><\/i>[WT], <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup><\/i>,<i><sup> <\/sup>Trp53<sup>R172H\/R172H<\/sup><\/i>,<i> Trp53<sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i>, and <i>Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>). Frequencies of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells were measured by flow cytometry and fluorouracil (5-FU) and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) were used as hematopoietic stressors.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>There was no change in the PB counts or lineage distribution of mature PB and BM cells in <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup> <\/i>and <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/R172H<\/sup> <\/i>mice compared to WT or <i>Trp53<\/i> knock-out mice at 8-15 weeks of age. We found that expression of <i>Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup><\/i> mutation in mice does not cause hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion under basal conditions, in contrast to heterozygous and homozygous deletion of<i> Trp53<\/i>, but does confer a functional advantage to HSCs in a competitive repopulation assay. <i>Trp<\/i>53<sup>R172H<\/sup> HSCs expand further following ENU exposure, similar to <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> cells and consistent with a dominant-negative effect of <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>R172H<\/sup>. Mechanistically, mutant p53<sup>R172H<\/sup> has a dominant-negative effect on <i>p21<\/i>-induced expression following ENU treatment. Repeated 5-FU injections drive proliferation of progenitors. To test the hematopoietic cell-intrinsic effects of mutant p53<sup>R172H<\/sup> on white blood cell count recovery, we exposed mice reconstituted with <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>+\/+<\/sup>, <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>+\/-<\/sup>, <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> or <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>R172H\/+<\/sup><i> <\/i>BM cells to a single dose of 5-FU and followed mice weekly for a month. <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup> <\/i>mice were least affected by the 5-FU challenge and showed the fastest and largest recovery of WBC count compared to <i>Trp53<sup>+\/+<\/sup><\/i>, <i>Trp53<sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i> and <i>Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. These results demonstrate that mutant p53<sup>R172H<\/sup> confers a gain-of-function property following 5-FU exposure that was not seen with deletion of<i> Trp53<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data suggest that <i>in vivo<\/i> expression of mutant <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>R172H<\/sup> has minimal effects on basal hematopoiesis. However, mutant <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>R172H<\/sup> induces either a gain-of-function or a dominant-negative effect depending on the type of hematopoietic stress and hematopoietic phenotype being observed. Overall, our results indicate that the functional consequences induced by various <i>Trp53 <\/i>mutations (e.g., deletion and point mutation) are not identical, but are influenced by the type of hematopoietic stress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/48d17123-30ff-4a7f-b84a-e15299fa25e2\/@C03B8ZJu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TP53,Mutations,Hematopoiesis,Leukemias: acute myeloid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13038"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tuoen Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanzir Ahmed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael O.

ADAR promotes cell survival and proliferation in multiple types of tumors, including breast cancer. However, the mechanism of ADAR-driven oncogenicity is not fully established. We focused on ADAR p110, the constitutively expressed and nuclear-localized isoform, and its role in managing genotoxic stress in cancer. ADAR p110 is involved in resolving R-loops, the DNA-RNA hybrids produced during transcription, and DNA damage response (DDR). We sought to elucidate the mechanism of ADAR-associated R-loop resolution and DDR that can be targeted in breast cancer. To identify ADAR-interacting proteins, proximity labeling was performed using ADAR p110 fused to ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2), followed by mass spectrometry. Among the positively enriched hits, known ADAR-interacting proteins associated with R-loop and DDR were validated by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. DEAD-box helicase DDX54 was among the nine RNA helicases interacting with ADAR. DDX54 and ADAR showed an additive effect on preventing &#947;H2AX signal. Additionally, knockdown (KD) of DDX54 increased ADAR expression, whereas ADAR KD did not affect DDX54 expression. These results suggest that DDX54 coordinates with ADAR to prevent genotoxic stress in breast cancer cells. As DDX54 and ADAR are both associated with R-loop resolution and DDR, we hypothesize that DDX54 and ADAR suppress R-loop accumulation and\/or other types of genotoxic stress. This may be through independent pathways despite the physical interaction between ADAR and DDX54.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7d45c720-750e-4e71-8e65-e05df829a0ad\/@C03B8ZJu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-03 Nuclear oncoproteins and tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,DNA damage response,R-loop,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13039"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sua Ryu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle A.

LFS presents as a broad phenotypic spectrum with highly variable age-of-onset and tumor types. The mechanisms leading to these phenotypic differences remain largely unknown, and many less frequent variants are not clinically defined as pathogenic or benign. Two missense mutations in the tetramerization domain of the p53 protein, F338S and F338C, have recently been of clinical interest; however, they are currently classified as variants of uncertain significance. Normally, p53 assembles as a tetrameric complex to bind DNA and transcriptionally regulate the expression of target genes involved in the cellular response to stress, acting as a crucial barrier to malignant transformation. Alterations to p53 structure can therefore lead to malfunction and ultimately tumor formation. Our structural analysis of the tetramerization domain demonstrates that F338S and F338C have significantly lower thermal stability compared to the wildtype protein. Furthermore, our functional assessments of apoptosis and the suppression of colony formation indicate that both variants operate with reduced tumor suppressor activity, although they maintain near wildtype functionality. We anticipate that our results will help to better understand why these mutations cause a history of predominantly adult-onset cancers in the affected families and could justify refining surveillance measures for these individuals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79e4c897-1289-41d3-9d75-ba9253d54a96\/@C03B8ZJu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-02 Genotype\/phenotype correlations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Li-Fraumeni Syndrome,Hereditary cancer,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13041"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicholas W.

We comprehensively investigate more than 1000 samples across 12 cancer types from the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and the International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC). The types are comprised of breast (BR), colorectal (CO), and ovarian (OV) cancers, clear cell renal cell (ccRCC), head and neck squamous cell (HNSCC), lung squamous cell (LSCC), hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular (HCC), and endometrial (EC) carcinomas, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and glioblastoma (GBM). In particular, we examine 8 Tumor Signature Associated Phenotypes (TSAPs), namely aristolochic acid (AA), aging, microsatellite instability (MSI), homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), POLE, APOBEC, smoking, and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. This study is the first to report proteomic markers associated with these TSAPs on a pan-cancer level. In addition to genetic alterations and mutational signatures, we utilize multi-omics data of high-resolution proteome, phosphoproteome, acetylome, and gene expression to infer expression signatures of TSAPs by defining the most critical changes in the transcriptome and proteome accompanying the transitions to these TSAPs, especially markers that were uniquely found in proteomic data. We consolidated multi-omic data and calculated the novel quantitative Tumor Signature Associated Phenotypes (TSAPs) score to predict the TSAP status. For example, the use of proteomic markers for MSI-TSAP scoring can improve clinical testing of MSI status. We further study environmental exposure-related tumor proteogenomic signatures, immune proteogenomic signatures, and the association between the immune subtypes and TSAPs. Smoking strongly influences the tumor immune microenvironment and disease prognosis. We show that expression signatures can facilitate the prediction of TSAPs and help to uncover their underlying molecular mechanisms. By connecting these findings with druggable databases, we provide a link to actionable therapies, identify putative TSAP-related targets, and offer novel cues to optimize therapeutic options for patients, such as how additional targeting of genes up-regulated in PARP1 inhibitor-treated HRD tumors may overcome resistance. This will promote the identification not only of unique druggable targets, but also to determine putative novel therapeutic targets using integrated approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/732d198e-5d22-43fb-b9e4-d7991b12a46c\/@D03B8ZJv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-02 Genotype\/phenotype correlations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Proteomics,Environmental exposure,DNA repair,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13042"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yize Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadezhda V.

Aurora-B kinase is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), chromosome condensation, the spindle-assembly checkpoint, and for cytokinesis. The activity of Aurora-B is essential for cellular division and proliferation. Inhibition of Aurora-B is cytotoxic, and inhibitor of Aurora-B - Barasertib (AZD1152) has been tested in clinical trials against different types of malignancies, including leukemia. However, regulation of Aurora-B expression is still largely unknown. Here, we present evidence that expression of Aurora-B in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is regulated at the transcriptional level by Ikaros, a transcription factor and tumor suppressor protein. Analysis of global chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in several B-ALL primary human B-ALL cells and cell lines, showed a strong enrichment of Ikaros at the promoter of the Aurora-B gene. Ikaros functions as a tumor suppressor protein and deletion of Ikaros is associated with development of high-risk B-ALL. Ikaros binding to Aurora-B promoter was confirmed by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) in primary B-ALL cells. The role of Ikaros in regulating Aurora-B transcription in B-ALL was tested using gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. Overexpression of Ikaros in human B-ALL was associated with strongly reduced transcription and overall expression of Aurora-B. Ikaros knock-down with shRNA results in increased expression of Aurora-B in B-ALL. Since Ikaros function in B-ALL is negatively regulated by pro-oncogenic Casein Kinase II (CK2), we tested whether CK2 can regulate expression of Aurora-B in B-ALL. Overexpression of CK2 via retroviral transduction resulted in increased expression of the Aurora-B gene. Increased expression of CK2 was associated with a loss of Ikaros binding to the Aurora-B gene promoter. Molecular inhibition of CK2 using shRNA resulted in reduced expression of Aurora-B in human B-ALL. Inhibition of CK2 was associated with increased Ikaros binding at the Aurora-B promoter. Ikaros knock-down abolished downregulation of Aurora-B expression in B-ALL cells following treatment with CK2 inhibitors. These data demonstrate that CK2 and Ikaros are critical regulators of Aurora-B expression in B-ALL. In conclusion, these results indicate that expression of the Aurora-B gene in B-ALL is regulated by the CK2-Ikaros signaling axis and provide a novel insight into mechanisms that regulate mitosis in leukemia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IKAROS,Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Aurora kinase,CK2 inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13043"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yali Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunhua Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Schramm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soumya Maru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Bogus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhimant H.

Missense mutations in the RHOA (Ras homolog family member A) GTPase have recently been identified in 24% of patients with diffuse gastric cancer. RHOA mutations are not randomly distributed along the coding sequence, but enriched in specific and recurrent hotspots. Substitution in codon 42 (Y42C) occurs in approximately 50% of the patients in which RHOA is mutated. RHOA orchestrates cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration and invasion, whose deregulation is essential for the onset, maintenance and progression of tumors. However, the functional role of wild type RHOA and RHOA mutants remains poorly characterized in gastric cancer. We used isogenic cell lines systems and animal models to study the impact of RHOA in the gastric tumorigenesis. RHOA loss strongly increased the proliferation, migration and invasion of diffuse gastric cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, but also when growing as subcutaneous xenografts in immunodeficient mice, and in experimental mouse models of peritoneal and lung metastasis. Stomach tumor burden was also increased in transgenic mice conditionally expressing a dominant negative form of RHOA in the gastrointestinal tract (RHOA T19N). Moreover, cells overexpressing wild-type RHOA or G14V RHOA (a constitutive active form of the GTPase) exhibited reduced tumorigenic features both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Conversely, diffuse gastric cancer cells engineered for overexpressing RHOA Y42C mutant, displayed enhanced growth and invasion <i>in vitro<\/i>. Importantly, stomach cancer tumors formed more efficiently in a transgenic mouse model in which we targeted the expression of Y42C RHOA mutant to the gastric epithelium. Collectively, these results demonstrate that RHOA has tumor-suppressive activity in diffuse gastric cancer, while the recurrent Y42C hotspot RHOA mutation found in these tumors is oncogenic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Stomach cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13045"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Agueda Martinez-Barriocanal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Higinio Dopeso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lizbeth M.

EML4-ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) fusion oncogene that drives 3-7% of lung cancer. Despite potent ALK inhibitors, EML4-ALK+ cancers frequently develop resistance during therapy. Recently, it was discovered that EML4-ALK and other RTK fusions form cytoplasmic protein condensates, and that condensate formation was required for oncogenic signaling. However, whether oncogenic condensates play a role in drug responses is unclear. In this study, we applied an optogenetic technique called &#8216;functional profiling&#8217; to understand how EML4-ALK condensates impact cell signal transmission and drug response. Using light-stimulated RTKs, we found that EML4-ALK condensates strongly suppress signaling through transmembrane RTKs, including through EGFR, a central receptor in resistance development. Strikingly, treatment with ALK inhibitors (ALKi) rapidly restored and hypersensitized RTK signaling. We found that EML4-ALK condensates suppress RTK signals through sequestration of the downstream adapter Grb2, which is essential for signaling through EGFR and other RTKs. The release of Grb2 from condensates resensitized RTKs within 10s of minutes of ALKi addition. Resensitized RTKs, in turn, caused sporadic RTK activation pulses throughout the cell population, and pulses originated from paracrine RTK signals released by apoptotic neighbors. We found that these paracrine signals counteracted ALK inhibitor therapy and promoted survival and drug tolerance. Blocking paracrine signals through co-treatment of ALKi with inhibitors of either EGFR or matrix metalloproteases enhanced cell killing and minimized long-term drug tolerance. Our study uncovers a role for oncogenic condensates in drug resistance signaling, reveals a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced suppression of RTK signaling, and suggests novel co-therapies to more effectively treat cancers driven by EML4-ALK and possibly other RTK fusions. Our work also demonstrates the potential of functional optogenetic profiling for drug discovery to promote cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fed0beaf-b0c5-41c8-9363-8714ed603bba\/@D03B8ZJv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cytoplasmic signal transducers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),Fusion proteins,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13046"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>David Gonzalez-Martinez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee Roth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Mumford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yael Mosse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asmin Tulpule<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trever Bivona<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Lukasz Jan Bugaj<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This condition is largely driven by germline mutations in the <i>TP53<\/i> tumor suppressor, which has a broad spectrum of functions including the transcriptional regulation of radiation response. Termed the guardian of the genome, TP53 serves as a critical checkpoint which coordinates DNA repair, cell cycle progression and apoptosis following DNA damage, ultimately controlling the fate of the cell.<br \/>Aberrant or deficient TP53 function, such as occurs in LFS, contributes to radiation vulnerability. As a result, there is particular caution in the use of radiotherapy to treat primary LFS tumors, in order to prevent the formation of secondary, radiation-induced malignancies. To this end, therapeutic options for LFS are often limited to surgery and chemotherapy, posing substantial constraints for the treatment of patients who may otherwise benefit from primary tumor radiation.<br \/>Metformin, a commonly prescribed anti-diabetic drug, is associated with lower cancer incidence in populations worldwide. Recent studies have shed light on the potential utility of metformin as a pharmacopreventive agent for primary tumors in LFS; hence, <b>we hypothesize<\/b> that the utility of metformin can be extended to the prevention of secondary malignancies following radiotherapy in LFS.<br \/><b>METHODS\/RESULTS: <\/b>To explore the chemopreventive potential of metformin in LFS, we completed tumor challenges using a p53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup> LFS mouse model. Mice treated prophylactically with metformin showed slower xenograft tumor growth compared to vehicle-treated mice. Ongoing work in our lab aims to characterize the effects of metformin on tumor growth following the administration of localized ionizing radiation (IR) to LFS mice. Briefly, these mice are treated with either vehicle or metformin, and IR is administered to the left hindlimbs to induce tumor formation. The timing and rates of tumor growth are monitored using magnetic resonance imaging. At endpoint, excised tumors are subjected to global profiling <i>via<\/i> RNA sequencing, proteomic analysis, and single-cell sequencing of discrete cell populations to characterize the effects of metformin on the development of radiation-induced malignancies. Results of these studies will be presented.<br \/><b>SIGNIFICANCE: <\/b>Overall, this work will advance our understanding of the chemopreventive effects of metformin, with the potential to broaden the treatment options available to LFS patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4051bf67-b5ac-4474-9818-63cb6d8bde4d\/@D03B8ZJv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,p53,Radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13047"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pamela Psarianos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Fischer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camilla Giovino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noel Ong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Malkin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Both SWS and PPV are characterised by vascular malformations in brain, skin and eye, with worsening neurological sequelae after birth suggesting a potential treatment window. Although the genetic causes are understood, and previous data in non-disease-specific cell lines have suggested MAPK activation, the functional effects of the mutations in vascular endothelium have not been studied. The characteristic finding of intracerebral intravascular calcification led us to hypothesise that intra-cellular calcium-signalling disturbances leading to localised imbalances in calcium homeostasis may be involved in disease pathogenesis.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Stable cell lines were established to study cell signalling downstream of <i>GNAQ<\/i> c.548G&#62;A, p.(R183Q) or <i>GNA11<\/i> c.547C&#62;T, p.(R183C) variants in endothelial cells. We re-expressed mutant <i>GNAQ<\/i> or <i>GNA11<\/i> alleles in HEK293 cells in which both endogenous genes had been knocked out for validation purposes.

XPO1 is the target of selinexor, which has received approval in hematologic cancers but not in solid tumors. We recently performed a large-scale genomic analysis of 42,793 patients with cancer spanning 322 cancer types (Taylor et. al. Cancer Discovery 2019). We identified a highly statistically significant hotspot mutation in XPO1 R749Q occurring mainly in colorectal cancer patients. We have generated 2 different isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines bearing the XPO1 R749Q mutation (HCT116 and LS174T) using CRISPR-CAS9. We observed that <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>, these cell lines did not reveal a role for XPO1 R749Q on cell growth and proliferation. A chemical compound library screen of &#62;200 FDA-approved cancer therapies revealed a strong therapeutic resistance of XPO1 R749Q cells relative to wildtype (XPO1 WT) cells, specifically to chemotherapies used in the treatment of colon cancer. However, XPO1 R749Q remained sensitive to inhibition with the selective XPO1 inhibitor selinexor.<br \/>Mass spectrometry analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionated proteins revealed XPO1 R749Q mutant cells had increased export of proteins from the nucleus compared to XPO1 WT cells. Upon ionizing radiation or chemotherapy, XPO1 R749Q cells had less DNA damage as measured by comet assay and &#947;-H2Ax immunofluorescence. XPO1 R749Q cells are resistant to chemotherapy but respond to selinexor <i>in vitro<\/i>. Selinexor effectively blocked nuclear export of canonical cargoes of XPO1 in XPO1 R749Q and XPO1 WT cells. The combination of selinexor and irinotecan showed high levels of synergy <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In<\/i> <i>vivo<\/i> observations in mice xenografted with XPO1 R749Q mutant HCT116 cells showed moderate tumor response to selinexor or irinotecan monotherapies but prolonged tumor responses to combination therapy. Single-cell intracellular signaling protein analysis using the Isoplexis platform discovered increased mTOR signaling in the XPO1 R749Q vs. WT cells. Western blot validation confirmed increased mTOR signaling in XPO1 R749Q mutants.<br \/>In conclusion, our current study sheds novel insights into therapeutic targeting of cancers where XPO1 mutations occur, such as colorectal cancer. Specifically, these mutations confer resistance to DNA-damaging therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation; however, they may predict for sensitivity to targeted agents such as XPO1 inhibition. We have generated unique genetic models for study of XPO1 that are currently lacking. Our study established the biological and mechanistic consequences of XPO1 R749Q mutations in cancer, thereby having a significant positive impact on the treatments of patients with cancer. Further work is ongoing for the identification of cargo proteins transported by mutated XPO1 that connect the effects of XPO1 R749Q mutation on nuclear export to response to DNA damage, mTOR signaling and XPO1 inhibition in tumors <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6f9bdaf-b625-4519-ac0e-8cf6f74ba1f8\/@D03B8ZJv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,Colorectal cancer,Resistance,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13052"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tulasigeri M.

They are novel cadherin like proteins predominantly associated with early development and morphogenesis, cell growth and patterning, cell-cell adhesion, cell motility (including cell invasion and migration). The Fat-protocadherins are derived from an ancestral Drosophila FAT like cadherin and are evolutionarily conserved. They have been primarily implicated in neuronal cell development and cancer. Several studies have implicated protocadherin dysfunction in cancer. Loss of protocadherin expression, chromosome deletion and epigenetic silencing have been implicated in kidney, prostate, colorectal and breast cancer. More recently they have been implicated in gastric tumors and gliomas. Based on these findings, protocadherins are thought to be tumor suppressors and in general seem to regulate cancer cell proliferation, migration and\/or apoptosis. However, multiple exceptions have also been observed and individual protocadherin functions seem to be context-dependent, as some can be considered either tumor suppressors or proto-oncogenes according to the type of cancer being examined. The mechanistics of the roles of the protocadherins in neuronal development have been well dissected but most oncological studies have focused on their characterization as potential biomarkers while the molecular signaling pathways through which the protocadherins regulate growth, invasion and metastasis are still poorly understood. For example recent research has shown that FAT1 is repressed in oral cancer owing to homozygous deletion or epigenetic silencing and is preferentially downregulated in invasive breast cancer. On the other hand, FAT1 is upregulated in leukemia and prognosis of preB-ALL patients with FAT1 upregulation is poor. Therefore <i>FAT1<\/i> is tumor suppressive or oncogenic in a context-dependent manner, while <i>FAT4<\/i> is tumor suppressive. FAT2 is highly expressed in breast cancer and lung squamous cell carcinoma and the elevated expression of FAT2 is correlated with poor patient outcome.Our preliminary research analysis of the TCGA data from the Genomic Data Commons Portal shows that protocadherins FAT4 and FAT1 are among the top dysregulated genes in cancer. We have also determined that FAT2 has higher Copy Number Variation (CNV) gain events than loss events. Given that there is a well-known concordance between CNV and differential gene expression we believe that FAT2 has a paradoxical oncogenic role in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13297e84-3287-40d8-b154-a626fe97820b\/@D03B8ZJv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 Oncogene growth factors and their receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Protocadherin,FAT2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13053"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Thomas Roache<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Megan Sumera<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zalaila Laird<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amrita Datta<\/i><\/presenter>.

Virtually all UM have activating mutations in the Gq signaling pathway. Metastatic risk in patients correlates with additional secondary mutations, where the lowest metastatic risk (class 1) is associated with EIF1AX and SF3B1, and the highest metastatic risk (class 2) is associated with BAP1 mutations. The interplay between the initiating Gq pathway mutations, and the secondary mutations found in all UM has not been well understood yet. Here, we utilize a multi-omics approach, to describe gene expression changes, the proteome, and phosphatome, following GNAQ mutation and BAP1 knockout in primary human uveal melanocytes. We generated human uveal melanocyte cell lines with inducible and specific mutations and analyzed via RNAseq, ATACseq, and mass spectrometry. Results reveal significant changes in pathways related to p53, chromatin regulation\/modification, gene expression, and RNA processing with noted dysregulation of genes JUN, HDAC4, YAP, and SOX10, which cause senescence in melanocytes following GNAQ mutation, and are relieved through additional mutation in BAP1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/54ed7b26-01a9-4c59-9f23-d74428027103\/@D03B8ZJv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-02 Genotype\/phenotype correlations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Cancer,Signaling pathways,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13054"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dawn Alexandra Owens<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Kurtenbach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffim N.

Our recent studies revealed an intracellular role of CCDC3 as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer (BrC). Bioinformatics datasets analysis showed that CCDC3 is under-expressed in BrCs, while its higher levels are correlated with higher overall survival and lower relapse of cancer patients. CCDC3 is positively correlated with p53 and its target genes. Ectopic CCDC3 markedly suppressed proliferation, colony formation, and xenograft tumor growth by augmenting p53 activity in BrC cells. In contrast, knockdown of endogenous CCDC3 using CRISPR led to reduction of p53 level and activity, consequently promoting the proliferation of BrC cells. Mechanistically, CCDC3 bound to the C-termini of p53 and MDM2, consequently stabilizing p53 in the nucleus and impairing MDM2 recruitment of p53 to the 26S proteosome without inhibiting p53 ubiquitination. Also, knockdown of CCDC3 caused the resistance of BrC cells to 5-FU to some degrees by alleviating p53 response to this drug. p53 induced CCDC3 expression by binding to its promoter specifically in BrC cells. Our results unveil a unique mechanism underlying CCDC3 activation of p53 in a positive feedback fashion to suppress BrC growth and suggest that CCDC3 deficiency could be a factor for drug resistance of BrCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/856624e9-f6cd-44c1-9568-70de54278736\/@D03B8ZJv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cancer cell,MDM2,p53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13056"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hyemin Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caiyue Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Hoon Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yiwei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jieqiong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allyson M.

All solid tumours share the ability to overcome contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP), the process by which intercellular contacts engage signalling to stop proliferation. Merlin, a tumour suppressor protein that is inactivated in a wide variety of cancers, plays a crucial role in CIP; merlin-deficient cells lose the ability to be contact-inhibited and subsequently form tumours. Although the role of merlin in cancer has been investigated extensively over the past 28 years, this protein has been notoriously difficult to study. To address this issue, we develop and utilize 2 split-luciferase biosensor systems that enable accurate quantification of merlin activity in real time. Merlin undergoes a conformational change that is functionally important in tumour suppression. Phosphorylation at a key C-terminal residue promotes transition of the protein from an open, active conformation to a closed, N-to-C terminal autoinhibited conformation. Therefore, monitoring this conformation change in real time could provide unique insights into merlin function. To do this, we apply NanoBiT split-luciferase technology to develop an intramolecular merlin biosensor (intra-Mer-BS). In brief, 2 split-luciferase components, LgBiT and SmBiT, are fused to the N- and C-terminus of merlin, respectively. Upon open-to-closed conformation change of merlin, LgBiT and SmBiT complement to reconstitute a functional luciferase and emit light. This enables accurate quantification of merlin&#8217;s functionally relevant conformation changes in real time. Importantly, cotransfection of the intra-Mer-BS alongside PAK1, an upstream merlin regulator that promotes transition to the closed conformation, significantly increases luminescent activity of the intra-Mer-BS, indicating that the biosensor faithfully reports on merlin&#8217;s conformation. Moreover, merlin has been shown to exert its tumour suppressive function through activation of LATS, the central mediator of the Hippo signalling pathway. In addition to the intra-Mer-BS, we develop and validate a NanoBiT biosensor to monitor the interaction between merlin and LATS (Mer-LATS-BS). This Mer-LATS-BS is used to quantify the effect of merlin activators and inhibitors on merlin\/LATS tumour suppressive activity in cancer cells. In summary, we develop and validate 2 novel bioluminescent biosensors to monitor merlin&#8217;s conformation changes and activity in cancer cells. The intra-Mer-BS and Mer-LATS-BS provide real time information with high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility. Ultimately, these biosensors enable high throughput screening to discover novel upstream regulators of merlin in cancer and provide mechanistic insight into how contact inhibitive signalling is propagated through merlin and the Hippo pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ace24fb2-c87e-4a86-8721-ed0f89dc7f14\/@D03B8ZJv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor,Hippo pathway,Split-luciferase,Merlin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13059"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander J.

While the development of driver-targeted therapies has significantly improved survival in subsets of patients with LUAD, studies examining tumor sequencing data and clinical outcomes have shown that intra-driver genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity underlie differential patient responses to these therapies. In particular, co-occurring alterations in the genes <i>SMARCA4 <\/i>(BRG1), <i>STK11 <\/i>(LKB1), and <i>KEAP1<\/i> are predictive of exceptionally poor prognosis and worse overall survival in metastatic LUAD patients. <i>SMARCA4<\/i> loss is also a hallmark of undifferentiated, highly chemoresistant NSCLC tumors. While these co-mutations most often appear in <i>KRAS<\/i>-driven tumors, their association with poor outcomes is maintained regardless of driver status. Studies exploring the molecular features of <i>SMARCA4<\/i>-deficient and <i>STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> co-mutant LUAD have yielded translational insights specific to these subsets, establishing a rationale to characterize the unique biology of <i>SMARCA4\/STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> (BLK) triple-mutant LUAD. To this end, we are profiling BLK LUAD through a combination of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and phenotypic assays in <i>in vitro<\/i> models. We have generated paired isogenic <i>in vitro<\/i> models of BLK LUAD via CRISPR-Cas9 knockout. Phenotypic analyses of these cell lines, whose engineered genotypes model varying combinations of <i>SMARCA4<\/i>,<i> KEAP1<\/i>, and <i>STK11<\/i> loss, have revealed growth rate differences <i>in vitro<\/i>, and pairwise comparisons of RNA-sequencing in these lines show downregulation of lung differentiation markers and upregulation of metastasis-associated genes concomitant with <i>SMARCA4<\/i> loss.

Primary tumors in the uveal tract are often treated successfully by enucleation or radiotherapy but 50% of cases develop metastases which occur primarily in the liver. Patients diagnosed with metastatic UM usually have a poor prognosis with a short median survival of 5-18 months due to the lack of effective treatment options. Metastatic UM responds poorly to many therapeutic options. Inactivating mutations in BRCA1-associated protein 1 (<i>BAP1<\/i>), a tumor suppressor gene and de-ubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme, have been reported in &#62;80% metastasizing UM and thus are associated with elevated risks of UM metastasis. However, the role of BAP1 in UM metastasis is unclear. Interestingly, silencing of <i>BAP1 <\/i>in UM cell lines was shown to inhibit UM cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Consistent with this finding, we show that BAP1-deficient or <i>BAP1 <\/i>mutant UM cells proliferated slower than <i>BAP1<\/i> wild-type (WT) cell lines. Re-expression of BAP1 in a BAP1-deficient or mutant UM cell line, MP65, also increased the proliferation rate of cells. Analysis of reverse phase protein array (RPPA) identified that phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein is elevated in BAP1 proficient cells. Re-expression of BAP1 WT also increased phosphorylation of S6 and its upstream regulator, p70S6K1. Additionally, BAP1 mutant UM cells were more viable compared to isogenic cells expressing BAP1 WT in response to amino acid deprivation. These findings suggest that loss of BAP1 is associated with better survival under environmental stress, a critical step during metastasis. Positivity for pS6 was detected in all metastatic UM specimen tested regardless of BAP1 status. This suggests a role of the tumor microenvironment in regulating pS6 levels in UM cells at the metastatic site. Our findings show BAP1-dependent regulation of UM cell proliferation and response to stress, and uncover S6 and its associated pathway as an opportunity for therapeutic target in BAP1 mutant UM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/def3fbb1-6c95-404e-bda6-73c7cee87a1d\/@E03B8ZJw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,mTOR,Stress response,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13061"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vivian Chua<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Usman Baqai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy J.

In breast cancer, Axl is overexpressed in Her2<sup>+<\/sup> and triple-negative breast cancers and is associated with resistance to RTK targeted therapies. Recent studies have shown that upon kinase inhibition, the Axl intracellular domain (ICD) can translocate to the nucleus, however, the biological significance and functions for nuclear Axl are poorly understood. Furthermore, a functional role for Axl during ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) progression, a requisite step for invasive breast cancer, has not been established. To address whether Axl mediates localized invasion during DCIS progression, Axl was deleted in a DCIS cell line (MCF10A-DCIS.com) using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach. Deletion of Axl shows a significant decrease in progression to invasive cancer in vivo, which is accompanied by decreased proliferation, however microinvasion is unchanged as compared to wildtype. Analysis of patient samples of pure DCIS, DCIS with microinvasion, and DCIS with invasive cancer shows a significant increase in Axl expression in patients with evidence of invasion. Interestingly, there is a significant increase in nuclear Axl in all patient samples with evidence of invasion as compared to normal breast or pure DCIS, suggesting an important role for Axl-ICD in progression to invasive cancer. Soft agar assays using normal cells (MCF10A) shows that while full length Axl (Axl-FL) is sufficient to induce colonies, Axl-ICD-transduced cells do not form colonies, suggesting that Axl-ICD alone does not have oncogenic activity. However, Axl-ICD significantly increases colonies in DCIS cells, suggesting that the ICD is important in the progression of transformed cells. Ongoing studies are aimed at identifying transcriptional targets of Axl-ICD in DCIS cells. These studies will advance our understanding of how Axl mediates breast cancer progression and will have critical implications for ongoing therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting Axl.

While <i>VHL<\/i> is expressed ubiquitously, its inactivation is tumorigenic only in specific tissues. We hypothesize that this tissue-specificity arises from a negative selective pressure on VHL KO cells that is tolerated in certain contexts. To assess this phenomenon, we induced <i>Vhl <\/i>deletion <i>in vivo<\/i> simultaneously across the mouse body and observed cell fate with single-cell resolution. Here we show that inducing widespread inter-organ <i>Vhl<\/i> deletion results in a massive removal of affected cells from tissue. Our study required technology that allowed us to visualize and isolate <i>Vhl-<\/i>recombined cells from tissue. For this, we developed a novel lineage marking model in which Cre-mediated excision of <i>Vhl<\/i> is coupled to knock-in of a tdTomato reporter cassette under the endogenous <i>Vhl<\/i> promoter. We used this model in conjunction with the ubiquitously-expressed <i>UBC-CreERT2<\/i> to induce marked biallelic (KO\/KO) or monoallelic (wt\/KO) inactivation of <i>Vhl<\/i>. One week after inactivation was induced by administration of tamoxifen, there were equal numbers of tdTomato-positive cells in both genotypes, implying that initial recombination was similar and that <i>Vhl <\/i>KO did not affect immediate cell survival. Surprisingly, there was a massive reduction in the number of tdTomato-positive cells in multiple KO\/KO organs after four weeks. This loss was accompanied by proliferation of tdTomato-negative cells, as assayed by BrdU incorporation, suggesting that tissues can at least partially compensate for loss of <i>Vhl<\/i>-inactivated cells. Finally, we found that the removal of cells was preceded by signs of cellular damage and stress, such as accumulation of p27, cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1, and TUNEL-positivity in the kidney and liver. Taken together, we conclude that <i>Vhl<\/i> inactivation is inherently deleterious to cells and entrains a negative cell selection process in multiple organs. One corollary is that there must exist some conditions under which such selection might not occur; secondary mutations found in ccRCC, such as in <i>Pbrm1<\/i>, or loss of individual HIF isoforms, might provide such conditions to <i>Vhl<\/i> KO cells. Currently we are investigating the role of these additional perturbations in modifying the cellular response to <i>Vhl<\/i> loss. Our study will provide new insights into the genesis of ccRCC by redefining the mechanisms underlying the creation of pro-tumorigenic niches following <i>Vhl <\/i>inactivation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/81e37b44-7a82-40d3-92d2-7d7cdbe597d4\/@E03B8ZJw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,VHL,tissue-specificity,cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13065"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samvid Kurlekar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanna D C C.

Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a more aggressive subtype of breast cancer that is categorized by negative expression of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and amplification of HER2\/neu. Because of its receptor phenotype, traditional hormone therapy fails to produce significant short- or long-term benefits for patients. Additionally, chemotherapeutic and surgical interventions often result in relapse and development of a more aggressive disease with higher rates of growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. TNBC also tends to affect women younger than 40 as well as black women, making it a disease of disparities. The Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1\/STK11) signaling pathway has been well characterized to have a role in defining cellular responses to energy homeostasis, metabolism, as well as tumor suppressive capabilities. It functions as a master regulator through a set of 14 known kinase targets to maintain its role in cell-type specific regulation. Peutz Jeghers Syndrome, a genetic disorder with a predisposition to developing malignancies, and many other solid tumor cancers are associated with a loss of expression, somatic mutation, or functional deficiencies of LKB1 activity. While studies have been done to understand the role of LKB1 signaling, its role and mechanism in the regulation of TNBC remains unknown. We previously demonstrated LKB1 expression to be associated with increased survival rates for patients diagnosed with TNBC. Therefore, we hypothesize that LKB1 activity in TNBC cell lines will inhibit cancer function. To test this, TNBC cell lines were transfected to overexpress LKB1 with vector transfections generated for controls. Initial molecular results demonstrate a reversal of EMT gene expression by qPCR in cells that overexpressed LKB1. Flow cytometry analysis of LKB1 overexpressing cells show a decrease in the GD2+ cancer stem cells (CSCs). Additionally, functional assays show a reduction growth and proliferation in 3D culture systems. Interestingly, there was no effect on proliferation in standard 2D culture conditions. GD2 was previously identified to be regulated by NFkB signaling. Because LKB1 overexpression resulted in the suppression of CSCs, we hypothesized that LKB1 expression suppresses NFkB signaling. To test this, we ran a western blot panel for NFkB antibodies. Interestingly, LKB1 OE cells had lower levels of IKK&#945;, IKK&#223;, and p65 compared to pcDNA controls. This suggests that LKB1 functions to inhibit NFkB signaling, resulting in the suppression of the CSC phenotype in TNBC. To summarize, LKB1 expression inhibits NFkB signaling, which leads to decreased CSCs. This results in reversal of EMT genes and diminished capabilities to form spheres. Future studies will be dedicated to identifying which of the 14 downstream kinases LKB1 activates to exert its functions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/580b36b4-26c5-45a0-83ae-f9232fe7ba23\/@E03B8ZJw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LKB1,NF-&#954;B,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13066"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Khoa Nguyen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madlin Alzoubi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Hebert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Elliott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hassan Yousefi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suresh Alahari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Burow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bridgette Collins-Burow<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we report that Ophiopogon D (OP-D) can inhibit colon cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by inhibiting c-Myc expression through activation of p53 and CNOT2 regulation. Our results showed that OP-D induced p53 expression via ribosomal protein L5 or L11 and inhibited c-Myc expression through CNOT2 in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, OP-D regulated cyclin D1 and CDK4 which are well known as cell cycle regulatory proteins. Consistently, OP-D inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT expression in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, OP-D shortened c-Myc&#8217;s half-life in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, CNOT2 knockdown enhanced the inhibitory effect of OP-D on c-Myc in colon cancer cells. Interestingly, OP-D has increased the apoptotic effect of colon cancer cells when combined with doxorubicin or 5-FU, a treatment already used clinically. Altogether, our results suggested that OP-D regulates colon cancer cell survival and induces apoptosis by inhibiting c-Myc expression via activation of p53 and CNOT2 regulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1948b498-3ecb-437a-81d2-37215a410361\/@E03B8ZJw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-03 Nuclear oncoproteins and tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,p53,Apoptosis,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19397"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hyun Min Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wona Jee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Do-il Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Somi Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ye-Rin Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyeung-Jin Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ji Hoon Jung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
