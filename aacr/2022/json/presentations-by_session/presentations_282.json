Approximately 20% of <i>KRAS<\/i>mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in <i>KEAP1<\/i>, a negative regulator of <i>NRF2<\/i>, which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response. Emerging clinical studies demonstrate that <i>KEAP1<\/i>-mutant tumors are refractory to standard-of-care chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation and more recently KRASG12C inhibitors. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of <i>KRAS<\/i>-driven LUAD we demonstrated that loss of <i>Keap1<\/i> hyper-activates Nrf2 and accelerates KRAS-driven LUAD. We observe that the ability of <i>KEAP1<\/i> mutant tumors to divert their metabolism towards antioxidant production comes with a cost, generating multiple metabolic vulnerabilities, including a dependency on glutamine metabolism that can be therapeutically exploited through the pharmacological inhibition of glutaminase and other glutamine metabolizing enzymes. Using sirpiglenastat (DRP-104), a novel broad acting glutamine antagonist which inhibits all glutamine-consuming reactions, we demonstrate robust anti-tumor efficacy in multiple mouse and human pre-clinical <i>KEAP1<\/i>-mutant NSCLC models. Furthermore, we have characterized the metabolic mechanisms underlying DRP-104 sensitivity. Our studies demonstrate that DRP-104 has a distinct and broader mechanism of action compared to glutaminase selective inhibition, suggesting broader inhibition of glutamine metabolism may be a more effective therapeutic approach against <i>KEAP1<\/i>-mutant tumors. We have recently demonstrated that KEAP1-mutant tumors evade anti-tumor immune responses and do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade, which is also supported by clinical observations. We are currently assessing whether DRP-104 is able to promote anti-tumor immune responses as a single agent or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade in KEAP1-mutant tumors. Our studies will provide a rationale for sub-stratification of <i>KEAP1<\/i>-mutant patients with hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway, which is a genetic subset of NSCLC with great clinical need, as treatment candidates for sirpiglenastat. A first-in-human clinical trial of sirpiglenastat (DRP-104) is currently ongoing and will further explore this hypothesis in a LUAD cohort (NCT04471415).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Nrf2,Metabolism,Glutamine metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sarah LeBoeuf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ray Pillai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shih Ming Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Triantafyllia Karakousi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Warren Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Volkan Sayin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Wild<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Thales Papagiannakopoulos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Cachexia is characterized by losses in muscle and adipose tissue mass, which are persistent and refractory to interventions, such as nutritional support. Under nutritional stress, the liver shifts metabolism to supply energy-rich molecules (ketone bodies, glucose) to fuel the brain and skeletal muscle. In this study we test the hypothesis that this adaptive response to undernutrition is impaired in PDAC cachexia, thereby exacerbating the systemic energy deficit and resulting in accelerated skeletal muscle wasting. Recent literature highlights the relationship between IL-6 signaling and PDAC cachexia. We hypothesize that in addition to acting directly on muscle and adipose tissue, IL-6 acts on the liver to drive metabolic changes associated with impaired adaptive response to undernutrition.<br \/>Materials\/Methods: Adult mice received orthotopic injections of the PDAC cell line <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>; p53<sup>R172H\/+; <\/sup>Pdx1-cre (KPC)<\/i> or PBS sham. In a series of 2x2 factorial studies, PDAC and sham mice were nutritionally challenged with chronic caloric restriction or acute fasting. Food intake and body composition were measured longitudinally. Blood glucose and ketones were measured at endpoint. Ketogenic potential was assessed using octanoate challenge after fasting. qPCR was used to assess hepatic metabolism and IL-6 signaling, and muscle atrophy. Circulating IL-6 was measured by ELISA. <i>In vitro<\/i> assays were completed using C2C12 myoblasts and conditioned media from KPC cells. Whole body IL-6 knock out mice and hepatocyte-specific STAT3 knock out mice were used to assess the dependency of liver metabolic changes on IL-6 signaling.<br \/>Results: PDAC mice maintained on caloric restriction were more susceptible to skeletal muscle loss than sham mice, even early in tumor development, when no wasting is observed in ad-lib fed mice. PDAC mice also display suppressed blood ketone and glucose mobilization.

However, there is little information on how KRAS-dependent alterations in metabolism change precancerous states and cancer initiation. Acinar cells can give rise to pancreatic tumors through acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), a reversible cell state that persists and progresses to neoplasia and cancer with oncogenic KRAS. During ADM, acinar cells transdifferentiate to duct-like cells, a process we hypothesized was mediated by metabolic rewiring. We performed transcriptomic analysis on acinar cells undergoing ADM and found metabolic programs are globally enhanced. Indeed, we and others have demonstrated how inhibiting metabolic pathways necessary for ADM can prevent transdifferentiation and tumorigenesis. A detailed analysis of our data revealed that the transcripts for NADPH-producing enzymes, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>G6pd<\/i>) and Malic enzyme 1 (<i>Me1<\/i>), were significant enriched during ADM. Following these results, we obtained <i>G6pd<\/i>-mutant mice and generated <i>Me1<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice and bred them into the KC (<i>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D\/+<\/sup>;Ptf1a<sup>Cre\/+<\/sup><\/i>) line, resulting in KCG (<i>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D\/+<\/sup>;Ptf1a<sup>Cre\/+<\/sup>;G6pd<sup>mut\/mut<\/sup><\/i>) and KCM (<i>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D\/+<\/sup>;Ptf1a<sup>Cre\/+<\/sup>;Me1<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i>) mice. Interestingly, KCG and KCM mice develop ADM and neoplasia faster than their KC counterparts. We also observe that acinar cells and ADM in KCG cells have higher levels of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) both <i>in vivo<\/i> and using primary <i>ex vivo <\/i>acinar cell cultures. Thus, increased ROS levels may underlie ADM acceleration in this system. In primary acinar cell culture, we can rescue the accelerated ADM phenotype in KCG cells with the addition of antioxidants. Furthermore, we find that treatment of wild type acinar cells with buthionine sulphoximine (BSO) to deplete glutathione levels and increase ROS also accelerates ADM in culture. These results suggest that NADPH and glutathione pools are important for regulating redox levels during ADM, and that reducing these pools leads to accelerated tumorigenesis. Together, this work demonstrates new metabolic pathways driving pancreatic cancer initiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Premalignancy,Redox,Oxidative stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Megan D.

Previously, our group measured arginine levels in the interstitial fluid of tumors (TIF) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) murine models and found extremely low arginine levels (2-5 uM) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite near complete absence of this critical nutrient in the TME, pancreatic tumors exhibit aggressive growth. We have sought to understand both how the PDAC TME becomes arginine limited and how PDAC cells adapt to proliferate in the absence of arginine. Using genetically engineered mice, we find that arginase activity in the myeloid compartment of PDAC tumors is responsible for arginine depletion in the TME. Staining of Arg1+ myeloid populations in human PDAC samples suggest a similar mechanism reduces arginine availability in human PDAC tumors as well. We then leveraged our newfound knowledge of PDAC TIF composition to develop a novel <i>ex vivo <\/i>cell culture media formulation with physiologically relevant nutrient levels and monitored arginine acquisition pathways using isotope tracing and metabolomics assays to determine how PDAC cells cope with arginine deprivation. Under TME nutrient conditions, PDAC cells consume available citrulline and use it to produce arginine by <i>de novo<\/i> synthesis. Starving cells of citrulline or genetically perturbing arginosuccinate synthase (ASS1), key enzyme in arginine biosynthesis, significantly reduces PDAC cellular arginine and proliferative capacity. Immunohistochemical analysis of both human and mouse PDAC tumors indicates that the <i>de novo <\/i>arginine synthesis pathway is highly expressed in PDAC but not in untransformed pancreas, suggesting a key role for this pathway in PDAC progression. Altogether, we find that myeloid-derived arginase challenges PDAC cells by limiting arginine availability and suggest that <i>de novo<\/i> arginine synthesis may be a critical metabolic pathway that enables PDAC tumors to cope with this metabolic challenge.<i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juan Apiz-Saab<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Muir<\/i><\/presenter>.

Sterol regulatory element binding protein Cleavage-Activating Protein (SCAP) is an essential intermediate in lipid-regulated activation of Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP) transcription factors, which induce expression of genes regulating lipid homeostasis. We previously demonstrated that the elevated SREBP1 arising from inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in mice genetically predisposed to pancreatic cancer additionally transcribed genes that induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, promoting basal rather than glandular cancer. To further evaluate SCAP and SREBP function in the pancreas, we developed a new mouse model with selective pancreatic knockout of the <i>Scap<sup>f\/f<\/sup><\/i> gene under the control of the Pdx1-Cre promoter (Scap<sup>&#916;panc<\/sup> mice).<br \/>Although size of the pancreas in<i> Scap<sup>&#916;panc<\/sup> <\/i>neonates was unaffected, and number of islets was normal, there was a reduced number of acinar cells, and some evidence of disorganized tissue structure. Preliminary histopatholgical assessment of pancreatic tissue of <i>Scap<sup>&#916;panc <\/sup><\/i>neonates indicated no acinar cell apoptosis, and unimpaired acinar proliferation, suggesting loss of Scap may cause a differentiation defect. Further supporting this idea, siRNA depletion of <i>Scap<\/i> in the rat AR42J acinar cell line resulted in loss of markers of mature acinar cell identity. <i>Scap<sup>&#916;panc<\/sup> <\/i>pancreata underwent progressive and selective loss of acinar cells as mice aged, with three-month old mice having large areas of acinar cell loss, and mislocalization of ductal cells. Coupled with this loss was a large increase in pancreatic adipocytes and mesenchymal cells, resulting in a highly disorganized tissue morphology accompanied by signs of inflammation. These phenotypes were exacerbated in mice maintained on high fat or high carbohydrate diet. Together, these results imply that SCAP and SREBP signaling in the pancreas plays an important role in mediating dietary modulation of pancreatic development, acinar cell homeostasis, and restraint of pancreatic adiposity. Intrapancreatic fat, associated with obesity and chronic pancreatitis, is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer, and SCAP polymorphisms have been to interact with diet in regulating obesity and blood pressure in humans; we propose SCAP-SREBP signaling in the pancreas may mediate dietary promotion of pancreatic cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adipocytes,Lipogenesis,Signaling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna C.

Here we investigated the role of BCAT1 in human patient-derived glioblastoma cells and the corresponding orthotopically implanted xenografts to understand how upregulation of the enzyme leads to a more aggressive phenotype.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The expression of BCAT1 was investigated in a panel of patient derived <i>IDH<\/i> wild-type glioblastoma cells and BCAT1 expression modulation was achieved using lentiviral expression of a doxycycline-inducible shRNA, to knockdown BCAT1 and expression of a BCAT1 cDNA to overexpress BCAT1. Effects of BCAT1 knockdown and overexpression were investigated <i>in vitro<\/i> in cell culture and <i>in vivo<\/i>, following intracranial implantation of mice with the relevant cells.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Variable levels of BCAT1 expression were identified in different patient-derived cell lines. RNA sequencing analysis of BCAT1 knockdown in BCAT1 expressing glioblastoma cells revealed that knockdown led to significant downregulation of HIF 1&#945; (Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1&#945;) and its targets, which was confirmed by Western Blot analysis of Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) and Hexokinase II (HKII) in cell and tumor lysates. The opposite was observed following BCAT1 overexpression. BCAT1 knockdown also led to higher DNA demethylation levels. Treatment with membrane permeant dimethyl-alpha ketoglutarate mimicked the effect of BCAT1 knockdown. These data suggest that decreased cell proliferation following BCAT1 knockdown in BCAT1 expressing cells is mediated by accumulation of alpha-ketoglutarate, a substrate of BCAT1. Cells that had no BCAT1 expression showed a similar growth profile and overexpression had no effect on proliferation, suggesting that these cells are not dependent on BCAT1 expression.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We conclude that in a subtype of GBM characterized by upregulated BCAT1, BCAT1 expression results in lowered levels of alpha-ketoglutarate, leading to reduced prolyl hydroxylase activity and stabilization of HIF 1&#945; and therefore a pseudo-hypoxic state, resulting in a transcriptome that favors a high proliferation rate.

However, the underlying mechanism was unclear due to limited understanding of metabolic control of epigenetics. Inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) causes reduction of NAD<sup>+<\/sup>\/NADH ratio. Recently it was discovered that this redox stress not only drives lactate production from pyruvate to enhance the Warburg effect, but also promotes the conversion of &#945;-ketoglutarate (&#945;KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), turning the substrate of DNA demethylase TET into an inhibitor of TET, suggesting a potential link between ETC inhibition and dysregulated DNA methylation in cancer. In this study we use a mitochondrial uncoupler niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN) to block the Warburg effect and remodel cancer epigenome. NEN treatment activates ETC and accelerates glutaminolysis to produce &#945;KG, which promotes promoter CpG island demethylation. This epigenomic reprograming not only upregulates tumor suppressor genes such as p53, inhibits N-Myc expression, but also activates neuron differentiation markers to promote differentiation in neuroblastoma cells. Hypoxia is one common microenvironmental stress existing in all solid tumor. NEN treatment reduces 2HG generation from &#945;KG under hypoxia, highlighting its application potential in preventing DNA hypermethylation <i>in vivo<\/i>. Associated with 2HG reduction, NEN treatment also represses HIF signaling under hypoxia. In addition, NEN treatment inhibits reductive carboxylation flux. Moreover, dietary supplementation with NEN reduces orthotopic neuroblastoma growth and N-Myc expression <i>in vivo<\/i>. Together, these results validated Warburg&#8217;s hypothesis that mitochondrial respiration is the key to maintain normal differentiation. Restoring ETC activity with mitochondrial uncoupler is an effective metabolic\/epigenetic therapy against neuroblastoma (Jiang et al., <i>BioRxiv<\/i> 2021).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Warburg effect,hypoxia,differentiation,2-Hydroxyglutarate,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiang Haowen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel L.
