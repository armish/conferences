[{"Abstract":"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and a leading cause of death in women worldwide. Among these subtypes, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis, with a dismal outcome especially in metastatic disease. Metastatic TNBC treated with conventional chemotherapy has a median overall survival (OS) of ~ 18 months. The addition of checkpoint inhibitors extend the median OS to more than 2 years in PD-L1 positive patients, but ultimately most patients succumb to the disease. Currently TNBC still poses as a clinical unmet need, and further understanding of the cancer biology may shed light in improving therapeutics against this deadly disease. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a crucial function for cell homeostasis. The ability to evade or circumvent apoptosis is an important hallmark of cancer cells. X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR), a cell membrane receptor that binds to the pro-apoptotic ligand EDA-A2, is a member of the TNF receptor family and has been reported to be downregulated in breast cancer cells. XEDAR has been shown to induce downstream apoptosis by binding to EDA-A2, by a mechanism similar to extrinsic apoptotic pathway. By interrogating clinical databases and cross comparison using TCGA, CCLE, and other breast cancer datasets, we discover XEDAR as substantially downregulated in TNBC. Transcription profile analysis between different XEDAR expressing profiles uncovered novel pathways that could be potentially targeted for TNBC treatment. RNA-seq profiling in XEDAR overexpressing TNBC cells were cross compared with aforementioned discovered pathways. Vulnerable pathways including angiogenesis were discovered as possible therapeutic targets. As a proof of concept, we combined angiogenesis inhibitors with EDA-A2 ligand treatment in XEDAR overexpression TNBC cells and observed synergistic effects for combination. Our study uncover XEDAR as a potential target for further treatment in TNBC, which remains to be further validated in preclinical and clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,XEDAR,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17799"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chih-Yi Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chung-Jen Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Yang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai-Jun Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jiun-I Lai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Our previous studies have shown that CTLA4 is expressed at low levels in primary human melanocytes but is upregulated in mutant-BRAF\/NRAS melanoma cells and tissues. Despite predominantly intracellular localization of CTLA4, its intracellular function remains highly contradictory and unsubstantiated. We found that ectopic expression of Ctla4 in mouse melanoma cell lines substantially promoted lung colonization in allograft model systems in syngeneic mice. Moreover, similar results were observed in immunocompromised recipient mice, suggesting an intracellular cell-autonomous tumorigenic role of Ctla4 in melanoma. These finding led us to investigated intracellular functions of CTLA4 and its potential roles in melanomagenesis. Through the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of our proteomics data, we found apoptosis as a major affected pathway in Ctla4-expressing mouse melanoma cells. We treated the cells (B2905-Ctla4-ee and EV control) with doxorubicin to induce apoptosis, followed by assessment by Annexin V assay. We found that Ctla4 expressing mouse melanoma cells were significantly resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. In reciprocal experiment, we generated (by CRISPR-Cas9) CTLA4-knockout A2058 human melanoma cells that exhibit high endogenous CTLA4 expression and we found that knockout cells showed significantly increased apoptosis than the parental cells. Moreover, we also observed significant upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bnip3, Birc6, Pak1, Mcl-1, Survivin, Rac1\/Cdc42, Bcl-2, and Bnip3l) and downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (p53 and Bad) in CTLA4-expressing human melanoma cell lines. CTLA4-expressing cells also showed significantly higher invasion in Matrigel-coated transwell assay. These findings lead us to conclude that CTLA4 plays a significant role in regulating apoptosis and promoting melanoma progression in BRAF\/NRAS mutant cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6c4a1ac7-3e2e-41ad-9b76-852caee91cb3\/@x03B8ZSj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,CTLA-4,Melanoma\/skin cancers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17800"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hasan Raza Kazmi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuan Mo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Preston-Alp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Gross<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hassaan Wajeeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Merali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Soboloff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Salim Merali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>M.

Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process that can be regulated by starvation or stress. Among several cellular stresses, hypoxia and nutrient stress can strongly activate autophagy-related genes. Autophagy plays dual roles in cancer; it can be pro-death or pro-survival. The ability of the cancer cells to survive long-term under stress is still a vast question to cancer researchers. The nutrient status of is sensed by LKB1 downstream kinases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Recent studies revealed that BRSK2 is one of the AMPK related kinases regulated by LKB1 is the activator of WIPI protein function as building blocks for the formation of the autophagosome. Brain-specific kinases 1 and 2 are highly expressed in the mammalian forebrain regulating neuronal polarity and have lower expression in the testis and pancreas. We identified BRSK2 as one of the top genes highly expressed in 10 primary breast cancer tissue with a record of future bone metastasis compared to 10 primary breast tumors with no metastasis record through RNA seq analysis. Our extended analysis using TCGA and METABRIC cohort data unfolded that BRSK2 is highly elevated in breast cancer tumors compared to control breast tissue (p&#60; 0.001), mainly in stage IV patients compared to other stages (p= 0.01). Furthermore, we observed that BRSK2 is differentially expressed in various breast cancer cell lines, in contrast, no expression in nonmalignant breast epithelial cells (MCF10A). We selected MDA-231 and BT474 cell lines having relatively lower BRSK2 expression, and expressed BRSK2 ectopically to understand details about BRSK2-mediated autophagy under nutrient stress. Interestingly, we observed that BRSK2 augmented nutrient starvation mediated autophagic flux in Triple-negative and ER\/PR-positive breast cancer cell lines, along with elevated AKT, p-NF-kB, and STAT3 signaling pathways for survival under nutrient stress conditions. We further observed that several inflammatory cytokines CXCL1, CXCL6, TNF-&#945;, and IL1-&#946;, were significantly upregulated with BRSK2 overexpressed cells compared with the control cells. Knockdown of BRSK2 reduces autophagy and enhances apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Altogether, our data revealed that BRSK2 play a role in increasing autophagy to support cell survival under nutrient stress condition through AKT signaling pathways. Blocking of BRSK2 with inhibitor has reduced autophagy and increased apoptosis and cell death. Thus, BRSK2 can be a potential molecule as a therapeutic target for breast cancer metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae682c97-7d3b-45b7-a9d7-40fa1ce48fba\/@x03B8ZSj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-02 Autophagy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Metastasis,Breast cancer,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17801"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nitai Hait<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>APARNA MAITI<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rongrong Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuaki Takabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masanori Oshi<\/i><\/presenter>.

This unregulated cellular proliferation can be interrupted through intervention therapy. One such strategy utilizes proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs). PROTACs are heterobifunctional small molecular structures consisting of a ligand that binds to a target protein, and upon binding can recruit an E3 ligase which ubiquitinates the target protein, and eventually directs ubiquitinated protein for proteasomal degradation. This has been exploited as a revolutionary therapeutic strategy to degrade oncogenic and\/or anti-apoptotic protein(s) that are overly expressed and offer a growth advantage in actively growing tumors. The accumulation of anti-apoptotic proteins creates resistance within the tumor against cancer treatments and preventative strategies in the clinical setting. In the present study, we used DT2216, a PROTAC that targets and promotes degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL via the VHL (E3 ligase) pathway in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (T-ALL). Unlike other preclinical studies, like ABT263, DT2216 does not cause thrombocytopenia because VHL is poorly expressed in platelets.<i> <\/i>In our preclinical study, we treated thirteen human T-ALL cells with varying concentrations of DT2216 (0-1 &#181;M) for 24 h and analyzed Bcl-xL expression by western blot analysis. Our data suggests that DT2216 results in the robust degradation of Bcl-xL in a dose-dependent manner at a minimal dose of 10 nM in eight of the cell lines studied (ALL-SIL, P12-Ichikawa, Jurkat, SUP-T1, HBP-ALL, HSB-2, PEER, and DND-41). Bcl-xL degradation triggers apoptosis, which was evident through the presence of cleaved products for Caspase-3 and PARP-1. We examined the expression of other anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in response to DT2216 and neither protein was changed, which highlights DT2216&#8217;s specificity. We further evaluated the effect of DT2216 on the survival of T-ALL cells. Our data suggests that the IC<sub>50<\/sub> for all the T-ALL cell lines ranges from 2-100 nM, with the exception of SUP-T1, which exhibited an IC<sub>50 <\/sub>above 1 &#181;M. Our data suggests that DT2216 could serve as a viable, safe, and potent alternative or addition to traditional clinical treatments of T-ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/824ae7bc-0b56-4964-b9f4-c5e241830fa0\/@y03B8ZSk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-03 Bcl-2 family proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bcl-xL,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Mcl-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17802"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arunima S.

There are ongoing efforts to identify novel molecules to manage advanced and metastatic CRC. Modifications in the quinazoline ring has resulted in effective and clinically approved drugs such as gefitinib, erlotinib, vandetanib among others. We rationalized and synthesized a series of 4-anilinoquinazoline analogues, DW (1-10) and evaluated them for anticancer efficacy in human CRC cell lines (HCT116, HT29, SW620). We identified a lead molecule DW-8, with sub-micromolar potency against CRC lines with selectivity index of DW-8 being &#62;2 folds in CRC cells compared to non-cancerous line, CRL1459. Mechanistically, DW-8 produced significant morphological changes in SW620 cells. This included nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, blebbing and apoptotic bodies formation which are the hallmarks of apoptosis. We found that the DW-8 induced apoptosis by i) producing cell cycle arrest at G2 phase; ii) activated intrinsic apoptosis as shown by cleaved caspases such as caspase-9, the executioner caspases 3 and 7; iii) produced nuclear fragmentation; and iv) increased the level of reactive oxygen species. We are now synthesizing the analogs of DW-8 and are optimizing the formulations for efficient delivery to CRC tumors in vivo. Overall, our result suggests DW-8 may represent a suitable lead for developing novel compound to treat CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ff1fc95a-f04e-4a08-b840-bb5438dcf2c1\/@y03B8ZSk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Apoptosis,Cytotoxicity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18735"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rabin Neupane<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saloni Malla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariam Sami Abou-Dahech<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swapnaa Balaji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shikha Kumari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chandrabose Karthikeyan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amit K.

While impaired ferroptosis has been shown to contribute to tumor development, uncontrolled ferroptosis has been associated with neurodegeneration, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular disease. To defend against ferroptosis, cells are equipped with several antioxidant systems. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a major antioxidant enzyme that localizes in both the cytosol and the mitochondria and uses glutathione (GSH) as its cofactor to convert lipid hydroperoxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. In addition, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol in the inner mitochondrial membrane and inhibits mitochondrial lipid peroxidation independently of the GSH-GPX4 mechanism. Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the major therapies used to treat cancers. During RT, the radiolysis of water generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), subsequently leading to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. In our study, we aim to determine the role of DHODH in RT-induced ferroptosis and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of DHODH inhibitors as robust radiosensitizers in cancer treatment.<br \/>Methods: Lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation were evaluated by flow cytometry. Ferroptosis marker PTGS2 expression levels were evaluated by real-time PCR. CRISPR-Cas9 system used to generate knock-out cancer cell lines. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) co-treated with RT and DHODH inhibitors were employed to access the combination effect. Lipid peroxidation marker 4-HNE levels in tumors were evaluated by immunohistochemistry.<br \/>Results: RT induced lipid peroxidation and PTGS2 expression in a variety of cancer cell lines. Genetic knockout of DHODH caused cells more sensitive to RT-induced ferroptosis. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of DHODH sensitized cancer cells to RT-induced ferroptotic cell death both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RT induces ROS production in mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. DHODH catalyzes the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol, which acts as an antioxidant to inhibit lipid peroxidation in mitochondria. In general, DHODH inhibition significantly sensitizes cancer cells to RT-induced ferroptosis by decreasing ubiquinol levels in mitochondria.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study suggests a model in which DHODH inhibition enhances RT-induced ferroptosis. DHODH inhibition significantly decreases the ubiquinol\/ubiquinone ratio in mitochondria, thereby sensitizing cancer cells to RT-induced ferroptosis caused by mitochondrial lipid peroxidation. Together, our results demonstrate that DHODH inhibitors can be used as radiosensitizers through inducing ferroptosis and propose a novel combination strategy for cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/26c578d1-df45-4299-ba83-e53678f7d4c1\/@y03B8ZSk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Mitochondria,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18737"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chao Mao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amber Horbath<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guang Lei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boyi Gan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Ferroptosis is induced in cancer cells by inhibition of lipid peroxide quencher GPx4. System x<sub>c<\/sub><sup>-<\/sup> imports cystine into cytosol for the biosynthesis of glutathione. Tumor cells that are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs called &#8216;drug tolerant&#8217; or &#8216;Persister&#8217; cells which have distinct vulnerability towards iron mediated cell death or ferroptosis. Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) plays critical role for cancer cells to become drug tolerant. Tweaking the balance of UPR to make drug tolerant cells susceptible to Ferroptotic cell death could be an attractive therapeutic strategy. To decipher the emerging contribution of ER-stress in ferroptosis, we investigated the status of UPR following treatment of potent ferroptosis inducer RSL3 (<u>R<\/u>as <u>S<\/u>elective <u>L<\/u>ethal) in colon cancer cells. We observed an overall up-regulation of UPR activators (ATF6, IRE1&#945; and PERK) and their downstream effectors along with a marked overexpression of cystine-glutamate transporter (System x<sub>c<\/sub><sup>-<\/sup>). To further delineate the contribution of particular UPR arm in modulating System x<sub>c<\/sub><sup>-<\/sup> expression and subsequent ferroptosis, we made stable knock down cells of each UPR arm and discovered that PERK is selective and critical in inducing ferroptosis in colon cancer cells. Loss of PERK function not only promotes ferroptosis via increasing lipid peroxidation but also limits <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth in colon xenograft model. Further, we find that low PERK expression is associated with higher patient survival as per TCGA COLON CANCER (COAD) database. Overall, our experimental data indicate that PERK is a negative regulator of ferroptosis and genetic silencing of PERK sensitizes colon cancer cells to selective Ferroptotic cell death. Therefore, small molecule PERK inhibitors hold huge promise as novel therapeutics that can sensitize apoptosis resistant cancer cells towards Ferroptotic cell death.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cf0f8480-53ad-47e0-9c72-5e4512168594\/@y03B8ZSk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Endoplasmic reticulum stress,Reactive oxygen species,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20598"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Krishan K.

In this study, we utilized several dCas9-mediated CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) systems to activate two key pro-apoptotic genes <i>DR4<\/i> and <i>XAF1<\/i> in glioblastoma cells. CRISPRa is used to activate endogenous genes via either recruiting transcription factors or epigenetic modifiers to regulatory regions in the genome. Previously conducted studies showed that VPR, Suntag, and SAM systems are the most effective transcription factor-based systems for activating several genes in a variety of cell lines. However, epigenetic modifier-based systems that involve the recruitment of TET demethylases have more permanent effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that combinations of these systems may induce stronger activation. We systematically tested various CRISPRa systems and their combinations to activate <i>XAF1<\/i> and <i>DR4<\/i>, which are known to be epigenetically silenced in drug-resistant glioblastoma cells. Inducing the expression of these genes, we aimed to observe apoptosis in glioblastoma cells either at a basal state or upon treatment with the pro-apoptotic ligand TRAIL. By transcriptomic alteration and cell viability analyses, we demonstrated that the combinatorial system including dCas9-TET1 and MS2-p65-hsf1 was the most efficient one for the activation of <i>DR4<\/i> and <i>XAF1<\/i> genes in both 293T and glioblastoma cells. Another system in which multiple TET1 enzymes were recruited to the gene promoter together with MS2-p65-hsf1 was found to be effective similarly, suggesting that the promoter demethylation is critical for the activation of these genes. Activation of these genes with the most efficient systems caused apoptosis and also sensitized glioblastoma cells to TRAIL treatment. Our preliminary work on measuring methylation levels of several CpG sites in the promoter regions of <i>DR4<\/i> is in line with our observations of cell-based phenotypes. Together, our study indicates that the combination of transcription factor-based and demethylation-based CRISPR activation systems can induce pro-apoptotic gene expression in cancer cells and lead cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Future applications of this methodology might involve the development of cancer-specific pro-apoptotic therapies.<br \/>[E.Y. and A.K. contributed equally to this work.]","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/475876e9-0707-43e7-86d1-adf65b8e37ab\/@y03B8ZSk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-08 Transcriptional control of apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,CRISPR,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20804"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ebru Yilmaz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alisan Kayabolen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Semra Cemre Atalar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Buket Yigit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Burge Ulukan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mujdat Zeybel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tugba Bagci-Onder<\/i><\/presenter>.

These two herbs are included in most of the herbal cancer treatment formulas in China and Taiwan hospitals. We previously demonstrated that aqueous extracts of SB and OD inhibited mutagenesis, DNA binding, and metabolism of aflatoxin B1 and benzo[a]pyrene in carcinogenesis. In studies by Hugo (2006) and Perez (2010), the efficacy of BZL 101 (an extract of SB) has been demonstrated in preliminary Phase Ia and Ib clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer patients. It is also shown to induce an S phase arrest of the cell cycle by affecting the Cycline A2 and CDK2 expression in estrogen-sensitive MCF7 and estrogen insensitive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. MeOH and BuOH extract of OD have been illustrated to reduce MCF7 invasion via the inhibition of MMP-9 and ICAM-1 apoptotic proteins expression. Ursolic acid of OD could inhibit breast cancer metastasis by suppressing glycolytic metabolism through activating SP1\/Caveolin-1 signaling. In this study, the effectiveness of aqueous extract of SB and OD in the modulation of apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-157 and 93B (a drug-resistant APC-mutant of it) were investigated. Assessments were performed using green\/red\/blue fluorescent Apoptosis\/Necrosis Detection Test and the Human Apoptosis Antibody Array - Membrane [43 Targets] Test (Abcam). Our fluorescent apoptosis data showed that 3-hours treatment with 2.5 mg aqueous extract of SB induced a statistically significant percentage of apoptosis in MDA-MB-157 (46.5 &#177; 7.5% &#62; 16%&#177; 1.0% , p &#60; 0.05) and 93B (46.5 &#177; 7.5% &#62; 16%&#177; 1.0% , p &#60; 0.05) as compared to the negative control. Similar results were obtained with the OD treatment. From the antibody array-membrane experiments, modulation of various apoptosis markers by SB such as the pro-apoptotic proteins BID and BIM (p=0.019; p=0.007) in MDA-MB-157 and Bad (p=0.002), Bax (p=0.020), BID (p=0.001), p27 (p=0.004), p53 (p=0.022) in 93B as compared to the negative controls; and anti-apoptotic markers BcL-2, FasL, IGF-I, and p21 were also observed. OD treatment also induced similar significant production of these two types of proteins. These results suggest that SB and OD contain phytochemicals that induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-157 and 93B via the modulation of these pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8d9b0e6d-51f2-49a3-a3d6-d55a74b06bd3\/@y03B8ZSk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Breast cancer,Chemoprevention,phytochemicals,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20867"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>MinSeo Kang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathaly Manrique<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rekha Issac<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Wolf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jasmine Cha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>SungBeen Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hugo Jie Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Padma P.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential influence of GSPs on both liver and breast cancers. The anticancer efficacy of GSPs was investigated in vitro, using two human cancer cell lines; human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and human breast carcinoma, Zr-75-1.The potential influence of extracted GSPs was examined on cell proliferation, clonogenic assays, morphological alteration, and western blot was used to analyze the expression of oncogenic signaling pathways of STAT3, &#946;-catenin, T-ERK, and pERK, Bax, Bcl-2, mutant-p53, and caspase enzyme activity assay was measured by caspase colorimetric assay.Our data showed that GSPs treatment inhibits both cellular viability and proliferation in a concentration-and time-dependent fashion in both breast and liver cancer cell lines after 48h. Furthermore, mechanistic studies showed that GSPs induced late apoptosis by 72% that was associated with cell morphological changes, histone release from fragmented DNA, caspase-3 activation in a dose-dependent manner after 48h. Furthermore, GSPs down-regulated pERK, STAT3, &#946;-catenin, and mutant p53 levels as well as increased p21and Bax, pro-apoptotic signal, in both breast and liver cancer cells as determined by western blot analysis. All in all, our findings suggest that GSPs inhibit breast and liver cancer cells proliferation and induce cell apoptosis by suppressing the oncogenic signaling pathways that play a role in cancer progression which in turn introduce GSPs as a promising phytochemical for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f6ca9ee-41c7-46ae-b4ba-aca6974a2cef\/@y03B8ZSk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Breast cancer,Apoptosis,Proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21138"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"49190609-f95d-47b8-a213-7b71d0f70427","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49190609-f95d-47b8-a213-7b71d0f70427\/@y03B8ZSk\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rana Hamed Alneanaey<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nabil Taha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammed Lebda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aml Hashem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed Sultan<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, Arginine deprivation and Arginase clinical implications in human breast and liver cancers have not been fully elucidated. The objective of the current study was to investigate the potential role of the Arginine degrading enzyme, Arginase, on three cell lines; Luminal A breast cancer (T-47D), TNBC (MDA-MB-231), and HCC cell line, HepG2, respectively. Herein, Arginase was extracted and purified from the beef liver and its specific activity was 0.2 IU\/mg protein yielded 49% compared to the crude beef liver Arginase. The purified Arginase is covalently bound via a succinamide propionic acid (SPA) linker to polyethylene glycol (PEG) of molecular weight 5,000 to enhance the half-life time compared to the native enzyme with a maximum specific activity between 37~55&#8451; and pH 7~9. The potential influence of extracted Peg-Arginase was examined on cell proliferation, clonogenic assays, morphological alteration, and oncogenic signaling pathways of STAT3, &#946;-catenin, and miR-23a. Our data showed that Peg-Arginase treatment displayed a significant inhibition in cell proliferation and viability in a dose-dependent manner in both breast cancer cell lines, but not in HepG2 cells after 48h. Furthermore, mechanistic studies showed that Peg-Arginase induced apoptosis that was associated with cell morphological changes, histone release from fragmented DNA, caspase-3 activation in a dose-dependent manner after 48h, and cell cycle arrest at S and\/or G2\/M phases. Moreover, Peg-Arginase down-regulated miR-23a, STAT3, &#946;-catenin, cyclin D1, and mutant p53 levels as well as increased p21and Bax, pro-apoptotic signal, in both breast cancer cells as determined by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. <i>In vivo<\/i>, the effects of native- and Peg-Arginase enzymes were examined on MNU-induced mammary tumors in Albino-Wister rats. Our data showed that 400 IU of native- or peg- Arginase twice per week for two weeks significantly inhibited the growth of MNU-induced mammary tumors by 58.8&#177;4.1 % for peg-Arginase compared to 19.7&#177;3.5 % for native-Arginase. Furthermore, the results also revealed a significant reduction in activities of ALT, AST, and ALP in the Peg-Arginase group compared to MNU untreated or native-Arginase groups, suggesting that Peg-Arginase may eliminate the hepatotoxic effect of the MNU. All in all, our results suggested that the arginine-depleting enzyme, Peg-Arginase, exerted an anticancer effect against both T-47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines through cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a7da3a45-e039-45a6-8931-ce5f29bbfecf\/@y03B8ZSk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB02-01 Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),p53,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21359"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"16c67541-7f53-4c16-8c4e-92c48f2b513e","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/16c67541-7f53-4c16-8c4e-92c48f2b513e\/@y03B8ZSk\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Asmaa Ali<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omnia Ali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Doaa Othman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed Sultan<\/i><\/presenter>.
