[{"Abstract":"The expression of synthetic biomarkers from genetic constructs represents a new paradigm of molecular diagnostic tools for early cancer detection and localization. One of the limitations of liquid biopsy approaches is the low abundance of endogenous biomarkers shed in early-stage disease. To overcome this, Earli&#8217;s platform instead uses genetic constructs to force tumors to produce cancer-activated synthetic biomarkers. Thus, technologies that deliver DNA to tumor cells in multiple tissues need to be developed. While non-viral delivery systems such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have achieved clinical success for RNA, the delivery of DNA to tumor cells remains a challenge. We have engineered two classes of nanoparticles using biodegradable and ionizable cationic materials. The efficacy of these nanoparticles to deliver a DNA nanoplasmid containing a cancer-activated promoter to drive expression of a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was evaluated in multiple cell-derived xenograft (CDX) models.<br \/>The first class of nanoparticles was comprised of poly-beta-amino-ester polymers (PBAEs). Systematic screening of a library of PBAEs and optimization of PEG-lipid content produced nanoparticles approximately 80-100 nm in diameter with slightly positive zeta potential, enabling biodistribution to mouse lung tissues. Testing of initial nanoparticle compositions identified safe and effective formulations that produced 5-fold higher SEAP expression levels in lung tumor-bearing animals versus na&#239;ve mice. Further enhancements produced SEAP levels up to 250-fold higher in tumor-bearing versus control mice but resulted in significant increases in liver enzymes, suggesting tolerability issues that are currently being addressed by improving the polymer and formulation composition.<br \/>The second class of nanoparticles was composed of ionizable lipids such as DLin-MC3-DMA that have been clinically validated for RNA delivery to the liver. Optimized compositions with helper lipid and PEG-lipid variants identified formulations that could successfully deliver DNA to the liver. These formulations produced 30-fold higher SEAP expression in tumor-bearing animals compared to na&#239;ve controls in an H1299 CDX model. A 7-fold difference in SEAP levels was demonstrated in an orthotopic Hep3B CDX model between tumor versus non-tumor bearing animals. Strikingly, LNP delivery of a cancer-activated Renilla luciferase construct produced tumor-specific bioluminescence, demonstrating the ability of the LNPs to localize liver tumors. LNP formulations were well tolerated, producing transient, mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes one day after administration that subsequently resolved. These potent and safe nanoparticle delivery systems are promising agents for enabling future clinical translation of our synthetic biomarker platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/34f5ec85-266b-40dd-a2ab-4f134574b254\/@v03B8ZAV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,DNA nanoparticles,Synthetic biomarker,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13861"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Badri Ananthanarayanan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Regina Nieu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weihang Ji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Blaine McCarthy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shengshuang Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Harwig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maggie C.

A plethora of molecular engineering approaches have been introduced to restrict the activity of antibodies solely to tumor instead of healthy tissue with the goal of improving the therapeutic index, such as masking the binding sites of antibodies with inhibitory domains. However, sophisticated modification is usually required while the outcomes are often mediocre. Previously we developed an ultra-pH sensitive nanoparticle platform named ON-BOARD. The strength of this technology stems from its ability to preferentially release the payload specifically in the acidic tumor microenvironment while staying intact in normal tissue. The safety and feasibility of using such a platform have been demonstrated by successful delivery of fluorophore to tumors for imaging of multiple tumor types in Phase I and II clinical trials with Pegsitacianine (formerly &#8220;ONM-100&#8221;). Pegsitacianine has been shown to be generally well-tolerated with an infusion-related reaction as the most common adverse event in the clinical trials conducted to date. Based on the clinical results, we present the ON-BOARD platform herein as a potential universal and effective tool for tumor specific activation and delivery of therapeutic antibodies without the need for sophisticated antibody chemistry or engineering.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies of atezolizumab, cetuximab, pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, and ipilimumab with the same variable region sequences as the original pharmaceutical drugs were used to demonstrate encapsulation by the ON-BOARD platform and pH-dependent activation. Encapsulated antibodies were purified using SEC and the encapsulation efficiencies were quantified by HPLC. Particle size and uniformity were studied by DLS. The formulations were accessed for bioactivity <i>in vitro<\/i> under neutral pH or acidified conditions using appropriate cell-based reporter assays.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> ON-BOARD nanoparticles successfully encapsulated the antibodies mentioned above without additional modification of the original antibody. Encapsulation efficiency ranged from 50-100%. The formulations were characterized as uniformly distributed particles &#60; 100nm in size with good stability. <i>In vitro<\/i> assessment by cell-based reporter assays demonstrated &#62; 100-fold activation window between the acid-activated and intact formulations. The pH-dependent activation was further confirmed by affinity and binding assay.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The ON-BOARD pH-sensitive nanoparticle platform demonstrated potential as an effective and universal tool for tumor specific activation and delivery of antibody-based therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/85f45b1d-7375-4512-b234-beaecb21ff4d\/@v03B8ZAV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Nanoparticle,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13863"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Gaurav Bharadwaj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingtai Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Gutowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Curran Parpia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Campbell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jason Miller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tian Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>.

A similar approach for lung cancer treatment could bring many benefits to the patient, including ease of administration, non-invasiveness, and potential for reduced side effects. Spray drying is a versatile, scalable manufacturing technique used to engineer therapies for delivery to the lung by dry powder inhaler. It is applicable to nearly all classes of molecules, including RNA, small molecules and proteins. Spray dried inhalation powders eliminate the need for cold chain storage, and can improve product shelf life compared with liquid formulations, improving access for developing nations and rural populations. Recently, inhaled delivery for a VEGF inhibitor, bevacizumab, has shown in preclinical studies to reduce tumor burden in rats at 1\/10th the dose of injected bevacizumab, when combined with chemotherapy. To enable the next generation of inhaled monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies by spray drying, mAb structural integrity is key. Spray dried materials undergo thermal and shear stresses, which can damage delicate mAbs. Herein we identified a set of analytical tests to evaluate the upper limits of heat and shear mAbs can withstand during spray drying. We exposed five cancer-relevant, FDA-approved mAbs to varying heat and shear stress then characterized changes to primary (1&#176;), secondary (2&#176;), and tertiary (3&#176;) structure and binding activity indicative of degradation. Using the following analytical techniques we detected graduations of degradation: capillary electrophoresis-isoelectric focusing (1&#176;), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (2&#176;), Raman spectroscopy (2&#176;), size exclusion chromatography (3&#176;), absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy (3&#176;), dynamic light scattering (3&#176;), multi-cell differential scanning calorimetry (3&#176;), SDS-PAGE (3&#176;), and binding activity ELISAs. Using these techniques, we developed a materials-sparing protocol to first assess whether an antibody is a candidate for spray drying, and second, to identify ideal process conditions for mAb spraying drying success. This approach will help to accelerate the development of inhaled protein therapies for lung cancer and other lung diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e28e7c8e-58e0-473e-9b32-ff71e6d412e9\/@v03B8ZAV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Bevacizumab,Cetuximab,Monoclonal antibodies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13867"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Madeleine Landry<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Pluntze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Shepard<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, their translation have been limited due to challenges with purification, scalability, and robust induction of cytolytic T cell responses critical to anti-tumor activity. We designed a nanovaccine construct by fusing the HPV E7 immunodominant epitope onto lumazine synthase scaffold. We demonstrate that through electroporation-facilitated DNA delivery encoding the antigen-scaffold construct, this nanovaccine is expressed and self-assembles <i>in vivo <\/i>into 60-mer nanoparticles. Compared to CpG-adjuvanted peptide and monomeric DNA vaccination, this DNA-launched nanovaccine induced greater CD8+ cellular responses against the E7 epitope and target tumor cells. In both flank and lung models of TC-1 HPV-associated cancers, the nanovaccine achieved significant tumor regression and prolonged survival compared to CpG-adjuvanted peptide. Anti-tumor immunity was retained upon rechallenge &#62;150 days after initial challenge, supporting the induction of long-term immune memory. In addition, we demonstrate that this DNA-launched nanovaccine platform can be used to form hybrid nanoparticles displaying multiple antigens simultaneously. These hybrid nanoparticles exhibit synergistic efficacy, with improved tumor control over administration of separate single-antigen nanovaccines. These promising results, along with facile characterization, scalability, and stability, support that DNA-launched nanovaccines can induce potent anti-tumor cellular immunity and are ideally positioned for further translational development for clinical evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f57a5b8d-dc39-4c09-8a33-b922b049abdf\/@v03B8ZAV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Vaccines,Cancer,T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13869"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kevin Liaw<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ziyang Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neethu Chokkalingam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Kulp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Weiner<\/i><\/presenter>.

We showed that SSHELs decorated with anti-HER2 affibodies (SSHELs<sup>&#8733;HER2<\/sup>) specifically bound to target cells and were internalized. Doxorubicin loaded SSHELs (Dox-SSHELs<sup>&#8733;HER2<\/sup>) were internalized and trafficked to lysosomes, whereupon the cargo was released in a pH-dependent manner.

We suggest that SSHELs provide several unique benefits and that they may be used as an additional strategy for this purpose. With a facile, reproducible manufacturing process that allows for straightforward targeting towards specific cell types, pH driven cargo release, and lower overall toxicity compared to a leading treatment, we suggest that SSHELs may represent a versatile strategy opening new research avenues for targeted drug delivery treatment of breast and ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0803c707-6f55-445d-8bf0-268e419589d0\/@v03B8ZAV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Adenocarcinoma,Bacterial treatment,Doxorubicin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13870"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Domenico D'Atri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minsuk Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Teresa Bilotta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kandice Tanner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David J.

However, as our group has shown in previous studies with FolamiR (Folate-conjugated miR-34a), endosomal entrapment of the therapeutic molecule is a rate-limiting factor in RNAi activity. To improve endosomal release of ligand-conjugates, several approaches are being explored such as incorporation of endosomal escape agents (nigericin), chemical modification to enhance stability of miRNA\/siRNA within the acidic compartments, and modification of ligand-receptor interaction to enable adequate release from the receptor upon internalization. Current fluorescent microscopy techniques are only able to approximately estimate the cellular fate of FolamiR without providing enough resolution to determine the endosomal stage, receptor disengagement and other dynamics involved in the endosomal entrapment\/release of FolamiR. To overcome this, we developed Folate-conjugated nanogold construct (FolaGold) that mimics FolamiR molecule. The nanogold in FolaGold is used as a proxy for miR-34a and electron microscopy can be performed to pinpoint the cellular fate of nanogold including receptor disengagement process, the endosomal stage as well as cytosolic enrichment at the nanometer resolution. In this study, FolaGold is validated to bind to folate receptor in a competition assay and is confirmed to be present in specific endosomal compartments in MB231 cells, unlike unconjugated nanogold. We further plan to use FolaGold to determine changes in intracellular fate of nanogold upon incorporation of endosomal escape agents (nigericin) and modification of ligand-receptor interaction by using a lower affinity binding ligand that facilitates ligand-receptor disengagement following internalization. While we are using nanogold labeling to determine the intracellular fate of ligand-conjugated RNAi therapeutics, the labeling can also help improve our understanding of endosomal release dynamics and activity of other ligand-conjugate based therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0671df24-0afe-47c7-a3ab-6fb1c9abae66\/@v03B8ZAV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Nanogold,Drug delivery,Endocytosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13871"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"8d7f324f-0f54-4b72-8f92-fc0d9b95bfd0","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8d7f324f-0f54-4b72-8f92-fc0d9b95bfd0\/@v03B8ZAV\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ikjot S.

EV parameters influencing cellular uptake include surface proteins, lipid profile, and physicochemical properties such as size and zeta potential. EVs isolated from cells are heterogeneous populations, which hinder the study of single EV variables and their influence on cellular uptake. Moreover, EV isolation is a lengthy and laborious process with an extremely low yield. Liposomes are synthetic vesicles that share properties with EVs, such as the lipid bilayer and the capability to encapsulate relevant biomolecules. In this study, we used a uveal melanoma (UM) model, a highly liver metastatic tumor, to characterize naturally occurring EVs and model them using liposomes.<br \/>Methods: We utilized liposomes as a model of EVs to study how the size and zeta potential influence cellular internalization. EVs were isolated from primary UM cells (MP41) using ultracentrifugation (UC) and characterized using dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, as well as electrophoretic mobility for hydrodynamic size, concentration, and zeta potential, respectively. Liposomes mimicking EVs were produced using the periodic disturbance mixer (nanoprecipitation). The lipid composition was DMPC: CHOL: DHP at different ratios and 0.2% molar concentration of SP-DiIC18(3) as labeling reagent. Liposomes were then dialyzed overnight using a membrane size of 12kDa. Cellular uptake was assessed in immortalized human hepatocytes, representing the liver microenvironment.<br \/>Results: Using surface response methodology (SRM), we created a model to predict size and zeta potential depending on liposome manufacturing conditions. We produced anionic and neutral liposomes with zeta potential ~-30 mV and 0mV, respectively, and with a size of ~150 nm, similar to EVs derived from MP41 cells in order to evaluate the influence of zeta potential in cellular uptake. Our results showed no significant differences at 0 and 6 hours between anionic and neutral EV-like liposomes. By contrast, the uptake of the anionic liposomes was significantly higher at 24 h compared to neutral ones. Moreover, EV-like liposomes were produced 1000x more concentrated than naturally occurring EVs isolated using UC.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we describe a novel approach using synthetic biology to produce EV-like liposomes as a model to study EV cellular uptake and its role in metastasis. Our data demonstrate that liposomes are a feasible tool to study EV variables individually, thereby addressing the high heterogeneity of biological samples, and producing high liposome yield, thereby helping to accelerate research<br \/><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/209caab1-6683-4e5b-ab13-eac8173ce119\/@w03B8ZAW\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Exosomes,Microfluidics,Liposomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13872"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rubén Rodrigo López Salazar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chaymaa Zouggari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thupten Tsering<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prisca Bustamante Alvarez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ion Stiharu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Mounier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vahe Nerguizian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia V.

In addition to this, lower drug stability and fast drug clearance among ADT patients are the major therapeutic limitations in drug delivery and drug efficacy. <i>Therefore, it is clinically warranted to develop an increased drug stability system to enhance the drug efficacy<\/i>.

Mesothelin is abnormally overexpressed in tumors such as ovary cancer and pancreatic cancer. Studies show a significant link between mesothelin overexpression and short survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. In this study, we screened a phage displayed-peptide library for peptides that selectively bind to mesothelin using mesothelin-overexpressing cells. After five rounds of screening, we selected a 9-mer peptide (named MSLN-Pep) that preferentially bound to mesothelin-high pancreatic cancer cells such as ASPC-1 and Panc-1 cells over mesothelin-low cells such as HEK 293 cells. MSLN-Pep was efficiently internalized into ASPC-1 cells and inhibited the cell migration and invasion while little affected the phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, a MSLN-Pep-guided proapoptotic peptide (MSLN-Pep-KLA) exerted selective cytotoxicity against pancreatic cancer cells over mesothelin-low cells. MSLN-Pep-KLA when combined with gemcitabine, a chemotherapeutic agent against pancreatic cancer, sensitized ASPC-1 cells to the gemcitabine treatment. These results suggest that MSLN-Pep is a promising tool for a targeted therapy against pancreatic cancer expressing mesothelin at high levels.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ef36e2de-aac4-4788-b05b-f8a4e2d77247\/@w03B8ZAW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Peptides,Mesothelin,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13874"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Min-Sung Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byungheon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

The standard care for GBM includes surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite advances in the different methods of therapy, the prognosis for gliomas has not been dramatically improved through the years due to high levels of reoccurrence therefore, alternative treatment methods are needed for GBM. Minocycline (MINO) is a common antibiotic with potential anticancer e&#64256;ects by acting as an anti-angiogenic agent which can help in the treatment and reduction of gliomas by reducing blood vessel formation. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapy alkylating agent that has demonstrated antitumor activity against highly resistant malignancies as high-grade gliomas. Injectable alginate scaffolds can serve as a local delivery system for controlled drug release and can be an important component for the development of a treatment method against GBM. The objective of this study was to investigate the optimal concentration of TMZ and MINO alone or in combination against glioblastoma cells (U87-MG) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and to evaluate the ability of an injectable alginate scaffold to control the rate of drug release for the treatment of GBM. In this study, U87-MG were treated with MINO (0-4000 &#181;M) and TMZ (0-6000 &#181;M), while HUVEC were treated with MINO (0-1000 &#181;M) and TMZ (0-2000 &#181;M) alone or in combination and a MTT assay was used to determine cell viability. Injectable alginate scaffolds were fabricated by dissolving sodium alginate and calcium carbonate in water and then homogenized with glucanolactone and drugs for 20 seconds. The mixture was then injected into a 24-well plate. After fabrication, scaffolds with MINO, TMZ and MINO\/TMZ were incubated in PBS at 37 &#176;C. At each timepoint (1, 4, 7, 10 and 14 days), the amount of drug released was measured by reading the absorbance of MINO and TMZ at 350 and 327 nm, respectively using a microplate reader. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) of MINO and TMZ were found to be 950 &#181;M and 900 &#181;M, respectively in U87-MG. In HUVEC, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of MINO and TMZ were found to be 150 &#181;M and 400 &#181;M, respectively. MINO and TMZ alone reduced cell viability by 39% and 41%, respectively, in U87-MG and in HUVEC by 36% and 34%, respectively. In combination, both drugs reduced cell viability in U87-MG by 58% and in HUVEC by 56%, resulting in synergistic effects for both cell lines. In addition, the application of the injectable alginate scaffold resulted in a controlled release of the drugs alone or in combination. In conclusion, the combination of MINO and TMZ resulted in synergistic effects on cell viability in both cell lines and the controlled delivery of both drugs with an injectable scaffold can be a promising method for the treatment of GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/264f5089-2180-4274-be63-39a2ef50cd1d\/@w03B8ZAW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Combination therapy,Drug delivery,Synergism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13875"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marco A.

Our studies show that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) cause dramatic increases in lipid peroxidation, 4-hydroxynonenal adducts (4-HNE), protein oxidation, protein aggregation, and proteotoxic stress signaling in a mesenchymal-like subset of non-small cell lung (NSCLC) and other cancers at doses that do not affect normal cells in vitro or vivo. Notably, AgNP sensitive NSCLCs are inherently resistant to clinically relevant therapies including epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ((EGFR-TKIs) e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib, olfatinib) and cisplatin. We identified two defining characteristics causing some cancers to be sensitive to AgNPs. The first is enrichment of cell membranes in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially arachidonic (AA) and adrenic acid (AdA), which are prone to oxidation. The second is high-level synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM), especially fibronectin and collagen, which places AgNP sensitive cancers under substantial baseline endoplasmic reticulum stress, making them susceptible to agents that increase proteotoxicity. Mechanistically, we find that in PUFA-enriched cancers, signaling from ECM sustains the AgNP sensitive phenotype by stimulating Akt activity and stabilizing cytoplasmic &#946;-catenin. Transcriptionally active &#946;-catenin increases expression of fibronectin and collagen, resulting in a positive feedback loop locking cells into the AgNP sensitive phenotype. Use of AgNPs to targeting vulnerabilities associated with ECM synthesis and signaling downstream of &#946;-catenin is a novel approach to overcoming multiple EGFR-TKI resistance mechanisms. Ultimately, our goal is to elucidate the precise mechanism by which AgNPs overcome resistance to clinically available EGFR-TKIs. Identification of the specific drivers of sensitivity to AgNPs (and potentially other metal nanoparticles) will guide development of therapeutic metal nanoparticles, enable selection of cancer patients who will benefit most or are at greatest risk to nanomaterial exposure, and will spur innovation of other treatments that exploit the vulnerabilities we identify.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/570632ea-8f19-4365-a0fa-cd540c724307\/@w03B8ZAW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Predictive biomarkers,Extracellular matrix,Lipid metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13876"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christina Snyder<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Rohde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravi N.

Gemcitabine (Gem) remains the first-choice treatment for PCa. It is administered as monotherapy in patients with locally advanced and metastatic PCa; but, drug resistance develops over time. Gem treatment resistance coupled with poor pharmacokinetics (short half-life) has resulted in poor treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study is to enhance the anticancer efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of Gem through chemical modification of Gem with stearic acid by using mice bearing tumors from AA and White pancreatic cancer patients.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b><b> <\/b>The<b> <\/b>Gem was modified by conjugating the 4-amino group of Gem and stearoyl acyl derivative to form 4-(N)-stearoyl-gemcitabine (4NSG). 4NSG was developed into solid lipid nanoparticles (4NSG-SLN) and characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), micro-elemental analysis, and high liquid chromatography (HPLC). Patient-derived primary pancreatic cancer cells from AA (PPCL-135 and PPCL-192) and Whites (PPCL-46 and PPCL-68) were used to evaluate the anticancer activity of Gem and 4NSG-SLN. We performed antitumor efficacy testing of Gem and 4NSG-SLN in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model harboring pancreatic tumors from the same AA and White patients.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>The H-NMR spectra displayed an amide bond at 11ppm, confirming the conjugated bond between the 4-amino group of Gem and stearoyl derivative. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub> =12 &#177; 2.1&#181;M) of 4NSG-SLN-treated PPCL-46 and (IC<sub>50<\/sub> =22 &#177; 2.6&#181;M) of 4NSG-SLN-treated PPCL-68 cultures were significantly higher than that of Gem treated PPCL-46 and PPCL-68 cultures respectively (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 56 &#177; 2.4 &#181;M, IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 57 &#177; 1.5 &#181;M, p-value: p&#60;0.001). We found a similar trend of higher growth inhibition of 4NSG-SLN treated PPCL-135 and PPCL-192 cultures (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 11&#177; 1.3 &#181;M; IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 9 &#177; 1.1 &#181;M) respectively, P&#60; 0.001 (<sub>4NSG-SLN-PPCL-135 vs. Gem-PPCL-135<\/sub>) and P&#60;0.001 (<sub>4NSG-SLN-PPCL-192-2 vs Gem-PPCL-192<\/sub>) compared with Gem treated PPCL-135 and PPCL-192 cultures (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 56 &#177; 1.8 &#181;M; IC<sub>50<\/sub> =57 &#177; 2.4 &#181;M) respectively. The anticancer activity of 4NSG-SLN showed an enhanced efficacy in PPCL-46, PPCL-68, PPCL-135, and PPCL-192 treated cultures compared with their corresponding Gem treatments. In vivo studies, 4NSG-SLN treated mice bearing AA tumors showed significant tumor growth inhibition compared with GemHCl treated mice bearing AA tumors. A similar pattern was observed where 4NSG-SLN treated mice bearing White tumors showed significant tumor growth inhibition than GemHCl treated mice bearing White tumors.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION: <\/b>This study reveals that 4NSG-SLN may be a novel approach to significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Gem in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/920ab9e4-0aa9-44a6-9f08-1a88a1aafc3f\/@w03B8ZAW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"African American,Gemcitabine,Pancreatic cancer,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13877"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andriana Inkoom<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edward Agyare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nkafu Bechem Ndemazie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Trevino Trevino<\/i><\/presenter>.

Current treatments are initiated based on CML phase severity or progression. Although unable to cure, tyrosine kinase inhibitors are first-line due to their ability to increase survival and provide fewer side effects than other treatments. All therapies for CML present with limitations due to reasons including mutations, resistance, tolerability, and a lack of selective drug targeting. Liposomes are effective drug delivery systems, shown to increase drug half-life and allow for better targeting of drug substances at the intended site of drug action. The objective of the study was to evaluate the cellular uptake selectivity and specificity of CLENs (cell membrane lipid-extracted nanoliposomes) in CML cells.<br \/>Methods: The CML cell line, K-562-GFP, was the chosen model for CML disease and drug selectivity studies. K-562-GFP cells were cultured and expanded In vitro for cellular extraction purposes. The K-562-GFP cell lipid extract (LE) was included to prepare K-562-GFP CLENs. Phase I of evaluation included physicochemical characterization and cellular uptake studies of preparations of CLENs including 0 to 40 mol% ofK-562-GFP LE content. Phase II of evaluation fixed the optimal LE content determined from the Phase I studies and varied the cholesterol content (0 to 40 mol%), to determine optimized K-562-GFP- CLENs for the target selectivity studies. The experimental cell lines used in the study represent other hematological diseases, RPMI 8226 (multiple myeloma), CCRF-CEM (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and U937 (lymphoma). Conventional lipid ingredients used in the preparation of K-562-GFP-CLENs include DOPC, Cholesterol, and DPPE-Rhodamine (used as a fluorescence indicator) for fluorescence studies using a fluorescence microplate reader.<br \/>Results: The results from the characterization studies revealed that the optimized composition and ratio for K-562-GFP CLENs was 85\/10\/5 (DOPC\/Cholesterol\/LE), the mean particle size was 292 +\/-58 nm (n=5). The mean zeta potential was -15 +\/- 9 mV (n=5). The average uptake for K-562-GFP-CLENs cells with 0% LE was 6822 +\/- 50.5 and 21,767 +\/- 3380 (p&#60;0.05) with LE. The average uptake for ALL cells with 0% LE was 6,558 +\/- 33 and with LE was 24,672 +\/- 3107(p&#62;0.05). The average uptake for CRL cells with 0% LE was 6780 +\/- 73.67 and with LE was19312 +\/- 1434 (p&#60;0.05). The average uptake for MM cells with 0% LE was 6992 +\/- 46.15 and with LE was 21,197 +\/- 1910.0 (p&#60;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the selective uptake of optimized preparations of K-562-GFP-CLENs by control ALL, CRL, and MM cells, when compared to the K-562-GFP (target) cell line (p&#62;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: Further research comparing the uptake of various preparations of K-562-GFP-CLENs by normal, and other negative controls cell lines in local and external microenvironments, are currently underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a0f6f5b-e7b7-4c48-bcd7-cb3c93a9e60a\/@w03B8ZAW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia,Targeted drug delivery,Nanoparticle,Cholesterol,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21097"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah Boddie<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akrofi Akotiah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominique Walker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Campbell<\/i><\/presenter>.
