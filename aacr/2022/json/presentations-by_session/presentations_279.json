However, except for a small fraction, it is difficult to directly target TF proteins due to lack of defined pockets and inherent protein-DNA, protein-protein interactions. In many cases, TF activity is tuned via cofactors, which e.g. dimerize to bind DNA (MYC\/MAX) or maintain active TF protein turnover (HIF1A\/EGLN1, MYC\/HDAC2). Identifying such targetable cofactors of TFs will open new opportunities to target oncogenic TFs in cancers. Genome-scale CRISPR knock-out screens have been proven to be a valuable resource for identifying targets and biomarkers in cancers. In this work, we developed a framework called CONTEXT (COfactor depeNdencies in high Transcription factor EXpression phenoType) utilizing functional genomic screens and matched TF expression data. In CONTEXT, we aim to identify cofactor dependencies associated with TF activities using 859 cell lines spanning 28 cancer types. We further utilized patient cancer gene expression data from the TCGA project, to prioritize clinically relevant TF-cofactor associations. In total, we identified 1,003 TF-cofactor associations which involve 196 and 503 unique TFs and cofactors, respectively. Our approach reliably identified previously known TF-cofactor associations e.g. HIF1A\/EGLN1, HIF1A\/VHL, TEAD1\/JUN but also previously unknown associations such as TEAD1\/RAC1 or TEAD1\/PTK2. Our analysis and validations provide a framework for the identification of potential cofactors of TFs which are crucial for the development and progression of cancer. We anticipate the cofactor dependencies from this resource to guide early stage drug development and inform on potential combination therapies in resistant phenotypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Venu Thatikonda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Lipp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Schlattl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Gerlach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Popa<\/i><\/presenter>.

Yet, I and others have shown that thousands of &#8220;non-canonical&#8221; open reading frames (ncORFs) populate the human genome, potentially representing a dramatic expansion of the cancer proteome. Despite their abundance, little is known about the role of ncORFs as cancer driver genes. We developed functional genomics approaches to pursue this question across human cancers. To determine whether ncORFs represent biologically active proteins, we experimentally interrogated 553 candidates selected from ncORF datasets. Of these, 257 (46%) showed evidence of stable protein expression using multiple assays, and 401 (72%) induced gene expression changes when expressed in cancer cell lines. The bioactivity of ncORFs was dependent on their ability to translate a protein: mutation of the ORF start codon prevented induction of gene expression changes observed with the wild type ncORF in 48 of 51 (94%) cases. Using custom CRISPR\/Cas9 knock-out screens targeting &#62;2,000 ncORFs in 20 cancer cell lines, we found that genomic knock-out of approximately 10% of ncORFs induced viability defects in cancer cells. We focused on two candidates for functional studies. In breast cancer, we described G029442 - renamed glycine-rich extracellular protein-1 (GREP1) - as a secreted protein that is highly expressed and prognostic for poor patient outcomes. Knock-out of GREP1 in 263 cancer cell lines showed preferential essentiality in breast cancer-derived lines. The secretome of GREP1-expressing cells has an increased abundance of the oncogenic cytokine GDF15, and GDF15 supplementation mitigated the growth-inhibitory effect of GREP1 knockout. In medulloblastoma, we found that MYC-driven medulloblastoma cells are enriched for bioactive upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are encoded within the 5&#8217; untranslated regions of mRNAs. We validated the ASNSD1 uORF as a top genetic vulnerability in multiple models of medulloblastoma, and its overexpression is sufficient to increase neural stem cell proliferation. Mechanistically, ASNSD1 uORF promotes a MYC-associated cellular program and interacts with the multiprotein prefoldin complex, which is required for tumors to maintain post-transcriptional regulation. Our work supports a generalizable principle that ncORFs commonly encode biologically-active proteins in diverse malignancies. Ongoing investigation of ncORFs therefore represents a new frontier in cancer research with the potential to define the next generation of therapeutic target genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Genomics,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John R.

However, integration of ctDNA tests into clinical management is critically impeded by the poor understanding of the distinct somatic populations comprising bulk ctDNA&#8212;including their relationship to synchronous metastatic tissue, and their temporal dynamics during standard-of-care treatment. Prior approaches relying on targeted and\/or low-resolution techniques (e.g. targeted exon sequencing, low-pass (shallow) whole-genome sequencing; WGS) do not permit comprehensive dissection of clonal architecture and unbiased analysis of putative resistance mechanisms.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed deep WGS on serial plasma ctDNA (median depth: 185&#215;) and synchronous metastatic tissue biopsies with high tumor purity from 35 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We developed a subclonal reconstruction algorithm optimized for our data enabling resolution of per-patient evolutionary histories and ctDNA clonal composition. ctDNA nucleosome footprinting was used to infer mRNA abundance in synchronously biopsied metastases and androgen receptor (AR) transcription factor activity at 3224 AR binding sites (ARBS).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We comprehensively assess all classes of genomic alterations and demonstrate that ctDNA harbors greater populational heterogeneity than metastatic tissue (p&#60;0.001). The evolutionary histories of ctDNA populations indicate frequent whole-genome doubling and attenuation of C&#62;T aging-associated mutation signature during subclonal differentiation. Although driver alterations were largely concordant between tissue and ctDNA, each individual metastasis contributed only a minor share of total ctDNA (average ctDNA contribution: 17%). By comparing serial ctDNA before and after clinical progression on potent AR pathway inhibitors, we reveal population restructuring converging solely on <i>AR <\/i>copy<i> <\/i>augmentation as the dominant genomic driver of acquired treatment-resistance. Nucleosome depletion at transcription start-sites is highly correlated with same-patient metastatic tissue mRNA abundance, indicating that ctDNA fragmentomics can recapitulate transcriptomic patterns in metastatic lesions. Most ctDNA samples exhibited strong ARBS nucleosome depletion which correlated with <i>AR<\/i> gene copy number (R=0.36, p=0.003). Finally, serial ctDNA nucleosome profiling at ARBS revealed adaptive transcriptomic resistance to AR pathway inhibitors, including lineage switch to a neuroendocrine-like (AR-low) state.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We show that the populations comprising ctDNA are typically complex and more heterogeneous than those found in bulk WGS of a synchronous metastasis.

Using TRACERx study we investigated the phylogenetic evolutionary patterns between matched pre-invasive and invasive lesions.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Post-operative pathology reports for 746 primary invasive tumors collected within TRACERx were screened to identify pre-invasive lesions that had been resected at the time of primary surgery. 50 pre-invasive lesions (21 AAH, 7 AIS, 6 MIA, 16 CIS) from 36 pts were subjected to whole exome sequencing with 119 matched tumor regions from 22 LUAD, 13 LUSC and 1 pleomorphic carcinoma. Phylogenetic relationships between pre-invasive and invasive lesions, timing of clonal divergence, mutational processes were investigated.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Two major types of phylogenetic relationships were identified based on whether pre-invasive and invasive lesions shared a somatic common ancestor (SCA group; 7\/22 LUAD, 11\/13 LUSC) or not (non-SCA group; 15\/22 LUAD, 2\/13 LUSC, 1\/1 pleomorphic carcinoma). Within SCA group, two evolutionary patterns were identified based on whether only clonal mutations or clonal and subclonal mutations were shared between pre-invasive and invasive lesions. 3\/16 SCA pre-invasive lesions from ex-smokers were found to diverge from the invasive tumor years prior to diagnosis. Compared with non-SCA, SCA pre-invasive lesions harbored elevated mutational burden, APOBEC mutagenesis, chromosomal instability featured by increased loss of heterozygosity and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). Whole genome doubling was only detected in SCA pre-invasive lesions. In SCA LUAD, 3\/7 exhibited clonal TP53 mutations, 3\/7 exhibited clonal co-mutations of KEAP1 and STK11. In 5\/15 non-SCA LUADs harboring a KRAS mutation, convergent KRAS mutation was detected in 4 matched pre-invasive and invasive lesions. Clonal focal gains on 3q21-29 (containing PIK3CA, ATR, SOX2) were detected in 10\/11 SCA LUSC, suggesting that 3q gains may represent early events in tumor initiation. In the non-SCA group, convergent SCNAs encompassing oncogenes (PIK3CA, SOX2, FGFR3) or tumor suppressor genes (STK11, KEAP1, MGA) were detected.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We demonstrate that matched pre-invasive and invasive lesions fall in two distinct phylogenetic evolutionary groups: those that have a shared somatic common ancestor and those that do not.

Their BCs are mostly of the luminal\/ER+ subtype and diagnosed at a younger age than BCs in sporadic patients. BC patients carrying a <i>CHEK2<\/i> c.1100delC mutation are at an increased risk of developing a contralateral BC and have a worse survival compared to sporadic BC patients although resistance to either endocrine or chemotherapy does not appear to play a role herein. To unravel the biological mechanism by which <i>CHEK2<\/i> c.1100delC exerts its tumorigenic potential, whole genome sequencing was performed of matching normal and primary BC (pBC) DNA from twenty female <i>CHEK2<\/i> c.1100delC mutation carriers at Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF). We compared the somatic pBC genomes of these twenty patients to 560 pBC genomes from the International Cancer Genome Consortium including 30 <i>BRCA1<\/i> and 25 <i>BRCA2<\/i> mutation carriers and 329 sporadic ER+ pBC patients. The validation cohort consisted of 517 metastatic BC (mBC) genomes from the Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment that were sequenced at HMF and included 24 mBC genomes from <i>CHEK2<\/i> c.1100delC mutation carriers. We found that CHEK2 pBC and mBC genomes were dissimilar to pBC and mBC genomes of <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i> mutation carriers and did not show evidence of a homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) phenotype. Instead, CHEK2 pBC and mBC genomes were very similar to genomes of sporadic ER+ pBC and mBC patients in terms of tumor mutational burden, single and double base substitution signatures as well as small insertion\/deletion signatures. The size distribution of structural variants (SVs), however, was different for CHEK2 pBCs and mBCs compared with ER+ as well as BRCA1 and BRCA2 pBCs and mBCs. Importantly, the <i>CHEK2<\/i> c.1100delC mutation was associated with an increased frequency of larger (&#62; 1Mb) deletions, inversions and tandem duplications (TDs) with peaks at specific sizes. Although CHEK2 mBC genomes more frequently harbored chromothripsis compared with other mBC subtypes, this did not explain the CHEK2-specific SV size distribution pattern. Moreover, increased chromothripsis in CHEK2 mBC genomes was not associated with a higher frequency of somatic <i>TP53<\/i> mutations. In fact, we did not observe any somatic <i>TP53<\/i> mutations among CHEK2 pBC and mBC genomes. This mutual exclusiveness suggests CHEK2-driven tumorigenesis could act through the TP53 signaling pathway. To conclude, CHEK2 BC genomes do not harbor somatic <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations and display a unique SV size distribution profile. Moreover, the absence of an HRD phenotype among CHEK2 BC genomes suggests PARP inhibitors will not be effective for treatment of BC in <i>CHEK2<\/i> c.1100delC mutation carriers. Increasing knowledge of the mechanisms of CHEK2-driven tumorigenesis may ultimately lead to the development of tailored strategies for treatment and prevention of BC for <i>CHEK2<\/i> mutation carriers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hereditary cancer,CHEK2,Whole genome sequencing,Genomic landscape,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marcel Smid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marjanka K.

It is often unclear if these atypical drivers arose early in tumorigenesis or were acquired during progression. A complete understanding of lineage associated genes (LAGs) will enable better interpretation of the molecular etiology of each diagnosed tumor.<br \/>Here, we used a cohort of 38,912 patients across 122 cancer histologies (each with 50 or more patients) profiled for somatic alterations (mutations, copy number alterations and gene fusions) using the MSK-IMPACT assay. Tumors with TMB &#62; 15 were already excluded. All alterations were classified as drivers using OncoKB. Allele-specific copy number calls were assessed using FACETS.<br \/>Overall, 95% of patients harbored at least one oncogenic alteration, with a median of 4 drivers per tumor. We observed widespread prevalence of drivers across lineages with each gene mutated in a median of 36 different lineages. Conversely, a median of 103 genes were mutated at least once in each lineage. Hypothesizing that cancer genes are influenced by cell of origin, we sought to identify lineages harboring significantly higher rates of drivers in a given gene compared to its pancancer driver rate. We identified 1781 significant (adjusted P &#60; 0.05) gene and lineage associations, and an additional 109 involving genes mutated at &#62;10% in the respective lineages but which did not reach significance were also included. Lineage-agnostic genes such as TP53 and CDKN2A were associated with a broad spectrum of lineages (90 and 55, respectively). However, overall, each gene we profiled was found to be associated with a median of 3 distinct lineages. For example, while BRAF drivers are found in nearly all histologies (n=91), it is enriched for drivers in only 8 lineages: melanoma (acral and cutaneous), thyroid (poorly differentiated, anaplastic and papillary) and bowel (mucinous adenocarc. of colon\/rectum, colon adenocarc. and neuroendocrine carc. of colon\/rectum). In all, nearly a third of all drivers were observed in non-associated lineages.<br \/>We next compared the somatic properties of drivers among genes in associated lineages vs. the same genes in non-associated lineages. We observed that mutations in LAGs were more often clonal (83% vs. 73%, associated vs. non-associated, P = 0) and showed enrichment for mutant allele imbalance in oncogenes (40% vs. 23%, P = 2e-111) and biallelic inactivation in tumor suppressor LAGs (71% vs. 58%, P = 4e-130). Furthermore, 93% of all OncoKB Level 1\/2\/3A actionable alterations, which are classified based on their histology, were in LAGs. In conclusion, our findings enable classification of drivers that are relevant for lineage-specific malignant transformation and advance our understanding of tumor biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Gene profiling,Molecular subtypes,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chaitanya Bandlamudi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Walid K.
