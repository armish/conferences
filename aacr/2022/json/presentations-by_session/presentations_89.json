Due to the small size of their genomes, PyV utilize complex patterns of RNA splicing to maximize their coding capacity. Despite the importance of PyV to human disease, their transcriptome architecture is poorly characterized. Here, we compare short- and long-read RNA sequencing data from eight human and non-human PyV. We provide a detailed transcriptome atlas for BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), an important human pathogen, and the prototype PyV, simian virus 40 (SV40). We identify pervasive wraparound transcription in PyV, wherein transcription runs through the polyA site and circles the genome multiple times. Comparative analyses identify novel, conserved transcripts that increase PyV coding capacity. One of these conserved transcripts encodes superT, a T antigen containing two RB-binding LxCxE motifs. We find that superT-encoding transcripts are abundant in PyV-associated human cancers. Together, we show that comparative transcriptomic approaches can greatly expand known transcript and coding capacity in one of the simplest and most well-studied viral families.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Merkel cell carcinoma,Bladder cancer,Alternative splicing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James A.

We recently reported that ultraviolet mutation signatures are prevalent in angiosarcomas of the head and neck, correlating with high tumor mutation burden and implying sensitivity to checkpoint immunotherapy. Metagenomic screening identified the presence of human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7) in two-thirds of Asian angiosarcomas - this subtype was enriched for immune signaling pathways and an inflamed tumor microenvironment, while lacking ultraviolet mutation signatures. Here, we examine the multi-omic profiles of angiosarcomas in an extended cohort of cases and provide an initial exploration of their spatial transcriptomic landscapes. The complexities of this disease in relation to therapeutic implications will be discussed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Genomics,Multiomics,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason Yongsheng Chan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
