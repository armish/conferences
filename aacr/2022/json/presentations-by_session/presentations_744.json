[{"Abstract":"Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal disease characterized by inevitable recurrence. Here we investigate the molecular pathways mediating resistance, with the goal of identifying therapeutic opportunities to target this tumor.<br \/>Experimental Design: We developed a longitudinal <i>in vivo<\/i> recurrence model utilizing patient-derived explants to produce paired specimens (pre- and post-recurrence) following temozolomide(TMZ) and radiation(IR). These specimens were evaluated for treatment response and to identify gene expression pathways driving treatment resistance. Findings were clinically validated using spatial transcriptomics of human GBMs.<br \/>Results: These studies reveal in replicate cohorts, a gene expression profile characterized by upregulation of mesenchymal and stem-like genes at recurrence. Analyses of clinical databases revealed increased expression of this transcriptional profile to be significantly associated with worse median overall survival (248 days vs 430 days, p=0.0004), and upregulation of this profile at recurrence. Most notably, we identified upregulation of <i>TGF&#946;<\/i> signaling, and more than one-hundred-fold increase in <i>THY1<\/i> levels at recurrence<i>.<\/i> Utilizing cell sorting, we observed that THY1-positive cells represented &#60;10% of cells in the treatment-na&#239;ve tumors and 75-96% in the recurrent tumors. We then isolated THY1-positive cells from treatment-na&#239;ve patient samples and determined that they were inherently resistant to chemoradiation in orthotopic models. Additionally, using image-guided biopsies from treatment-na&#239;ve human GBM, we conducted spatial transcriptomic analyses. This revealed rare <i>THY1<\/i>+ regions characterized by mesenchymal\/stem-like gene expression, analogous to our recurrent mouse model samples, which co-localized with macrophages within the perivascular niche. Since TGF&#946; signaling contributes to a mesenchymal\/stem-like phenotype, we inhibited TGF&#946;RI activity <i>in vivo<\/i> which resulted in decreased mesenchymal\/stem-like protein levels, including THY1, and restored sensitivity to TMZ\/IR in recurrent tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: These findings reveal that GBM recurrence may result from tumor repopulation by pre-existing, therapy-resistant, THY1-positive, mesenchymal\/stem-like cells within the perivascular niche. Furthermore, our data demonstrate the promise of targeting upregulated pathways in resistant subclones as a novel mechanism to achieve therapeutic response, and specifically that THY1 expression may represent a biomarker of response to TGF&#946; inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad1eb274-3924-49ee-8f6d-94d3b0fecbdc\/@w03B8ZX7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapy resistance,subclonal evolution,Glioblastoma,Spatial Transcriptomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wajd N.

While persistent ER stress (ERS) response leads to mitochondrial collapse, moderate ERS condition drives mitochondrial biogenesis and function. So far, various strategies have been tested to enhance the mitochondrial function in T cells to improve their anti-tumor potential. However, strategies targeting ER-Mitochondria crosstalk (by employing moderate ERS condition) to boost the anti-tumor T cell function have not been exploited yet. Thus, in the present study, we used carbon monoxide (CO), a short-lived gaseous molecule, to test if engaging moderate ERS conditions can improve T cells mitochondrial biogenesis, function, and anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy. Using melanoma antigen gp100 reactive T cells, we identify that CO induced transient activation of ERS sensor &#8216;protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)&#8217; dramatically increase anti-tumor T cell function. Furthermore, mechanistically we found that CO-induced PERK activation temporarily halts protein translation and induces protective autophagy (that includes mitophagy). To get further insight into how CO treatment kinetically regulates autophagic activity in T cells, we used LC3-GFP to differentiate between the cells that prepare themselves to undergo active autophagy (LC3-GFP<sup>pos<\/sup>) and those that fail to enter into the process (LC3-GFP<sup>neg<\/sup>). Using Ag-specific LC3-GFP expressing T cells, we demonstrate that LC3-GFP<sup>pos<\/sup> T cells show robust anti-tumor potential. Moreover, LC3-GFPneg shows a T regulatory-like phenotype, harbors dysfunctional mitochondria, and accumulates abnormal metabolite content. These anomalous ratios of metabolites render the cells with a hypermethylated state and distinct epigenetic profile limiting their anti-tumor activity. Overall, this preclinical data highlights that ERS-mediated activation of autophagy pathways modifies the mitochondrial function and epigenetically reprogram the T cells towards a superior anti-tumor phenotype and can be therapeutically translated to achieve robust tumor control in adoptive transfer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive immunotherapy,Autophagy,Endoplasmic reticulum stress,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paramita Chakraborty<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rasesh Y.

Current standard-of-care treatment including surgical resection followed by chemo- and radio-therapy remains palliative because of therapy resistance, majorly conferred by GBM stem cells (GSCs), leading to tumor recurrence. With no current effective treatments, novel approaches to overcome GSCs-mediated resistance to chemotherapy and irradiation are urgently required in order to achieve long-term success in GBM therapy. Oncolytic viral (OV) therapy represents a novel and promising biological therapy for solid tumor that preferentially targets tumor cells for lytic destruction, sparing the healthy cells and in the process activating host anti-tumor immune response. Among all OVs, oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (oHSV) is substantially ahead in the clinic, with an oHSV T-VEC approved by the FDA for metastatic melanoma treatment. Recently, G47&#8710;, another HSV1 virus, has been granted conditional approval for the treatment of GBM in Japan. Further, several other oHSVs including G207 and HSV1716 are currently being tested for safety and efficacy against GBM. This has fueled great expectations towards OVs as a promising alternative to conventional therapies. Our group has previously shown that PTEN&#945; expression by an oHSV (HSV-P10) resulted in further improved long-term survivors in intracranial tumor-bearing mice compared to HSVQ treatment. Here we aim to dissect the molecular mechanisms associated with improved therapeutic efficacy of HSV-P10 against GBM, and if HSV-P10 can overcome GBM cell radioresistance. The RNA sequencing and GSEA analyses of primary human GBM cells infected with control HSVQ or HSV-P10 reveals that while HSVQ virus infection leads to an increase in genes regulating IL6-STAT3 pathway, pivotal in maintaining stemness properties, HSV-P10 infection causes a reduction in the genes regulating this pathway. As a consequence, HSV-P10 reduces CD133+\/CD44+ stem cell fraction, induces DNA damage and sensitizes the GBM cells to irradiation. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism induced by HSV-P10 in combination with irradiation whereby HSV-P10 modulates IL6-STAT3 signaling downregulating Sox2, a core transcription factor in the maintenance of GSCs, with a simultaneous decrease in Nestin expression and enhanced GFAP expression promoting GSC differentiation. HSV-P10 infection in combination with irradiation reduces GSC tumor sphere formation in vitro and sensitizes GBMs to radiotherapy in an intracranial mouse xenograft model. Collectively, our findings provide a potential avenue to overcome GSC-mediated therapy resistance to improve the therapeutic efficacy for GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40a5e7a7-3d99-4458-b385-f701da038e00\/@x03B8ZX8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Oncolytic virus,Stemness,Radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Upasana Sahu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew P.

Tissue-specific factors linking stem-progenitor cell frequency to cancer risk and progression remain ill defined. Using a genetically engineered mouse model that promotes integrin mechanosignaling with syngeneic manipulations, spheroid models, and patient-derived xenografts we determined that a stiff extracellular matrix and high integrin mechanosignaling increase stem-progenitor cell frequency to enhance breast tumor risk and progression. Studies revealed that high integrin-mechanosignaling expands breast epithelial stem-progenitor cell number by potentiating progesterone receptor-dependent RANK signaling. Consistently, we observed that the stiff breast tissue from women with high mammographic density, who exhibit an increased lifetime risk for breast cancer, also have elevated RANK signaling and a high frequency of stem-progenitor epithelial cells. The findings link tissue fibrosis and integrin mechanosignaling to stem-progenitor cell frequency and causally implicate hormone signaling in this phenotype. Accordingly, inhibiting RANK signaling could temper the tumor promoting impact of fibrosis on breast cancer and reduce the elevated breast cancer risk exhibited by women with high mammographic density.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc47eef9-1239-4678-a656-ffaf006daa64\/@x03B8ZX8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-01 Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Mammographic density,Breast cancer,Integrins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason J.

As such, understanding the factors that influence the progression of cSCC are important. Aggressive cancers metastasize through a series of evolutionary changes, collectively called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During EMT, epithelial cells transition to a highly mobile mesenchymal cell type with metastatic capacities. While changes in expression of TGF-&#946;, vimentin, and E-cadherin are hallmarks, EMT is not an &#8220;all or none&#8221; process. Using patient-derived cSCC and adjacent normal tissues (ANT), we observed a significant increase in mRNA expression of TGF-&#946; (p&#60;0.05), TGF-&#946;R2 (p&#60;0.001), and E-cadherin (p&#60;0.005) in cSCC tissues by qPCR. Immunoblots performed on homogenized tissues yielded significant and parallel increases in protein expression of TGF-&#946; (p&#60;0.05) and E-cadherin (p&#60;0.05). We also observed increased expression of the EMT-associated transcription factors Zeb1 and Snai1 in cSCC tissue sections using immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in expression of vimentin (p&#60;0.01) by immunoblot and differential expression of four oncogenic and EMT-associated miRNAs; miR-31 expression was significantly higher in cSCC tissues (p&#60;0.001), while we observed a significant decrease in expression of miR-34a (p&#60;0.05), miR-200b, and miR-200c in cSCC tissues. Examination of ANT and cSCC tissue sections using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry showed differential, and reverse, expression of E-cadherin and vimentin among cells within an individual tumor. Collectively, our data support a hypothesis that cSCC tumors are undergoing a hybrid EMT program, where there is variation in expression of EMT markers by cells within a tumor mass that may be facilitating invasion. This hybrid EMT program may be promoting both survival and invasiveness of the tumors. A better understanding of this hybrid EMT process may influence therapeutic strategies in more invasive disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0188da52-b1a2-473a-8bb6-ca04e3491f09\/@x03B8ZX8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),E-cadherin,TGF-&#946;,Squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Christopher S.

Therefore, the identification of the systemic factors that can modulate the tumor cells and promote metastases will be critical to improve the efficacy of clinical treatment. Both mechanistic and functional studies revealed that acquisition of an open chromatin state on master regulators or cis-regulatory elements allow them to respond readily to microenvironment signals, thereby increasing cancer cell plasticity, tumorigenicity and malignant potential. Accordingly, analysis of open chromatin regions can help prioritize and identify risk of functionally noncoding variants. Given the power of open chromatin profiling on environmental risk prediction, we hypothesized that analysis of open chromatin regions may enable us to recognize functional trans-regulatory elements with their relevant systemic factors.<br \/>Methods and Results: In human prostate cancer cells, AR blockage by enzalutamide can induces cell reprogramming, as well as transcriptional dysregulation of the heterochromatin compaction pathway. Hence, we proposed that the cells were undergoing chromatin decondensation followed by epigenetic reprogramming. To detect the genome-wide open chromatin changes in this process, we performed time course ATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq experiments on LNCaP cells treated with enzalutamide over a 2 weeks period. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify the &#8220;open&#8221; enhancers and the transcriptional factors potentially bound to these enhancers. Integrated transcription factor binding motif analysis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) associated enhancer regions (GSE130408) and multiplexed siRNA screening revealed Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta (<i>THRB<\/i>) as the top candidate. <i>THRB<\/i> is regulated by the thyroid hormone (T3), a systemic nuclear hormone that, in enzalutamide pretreated LNCaP, VCaP and 3PDXs, is able to induce subsequent reprogramming to a fully enzalutamide-resistant and metastatic state. Interestingly, we observed that <i>THRB<\/i> regulated genes are upregulated in T3-induced resistant prostate cancer cells. Consistently, the <i>THRB<\/i> protein, TR&#946;, is abundant in several aggressive PCa cell lines. Notably, knockdown of <i>THRB <\/i>reverted the growth and the bone metastatic potential of highly aggressive PCa models, such as Pten<sup>pc-\/-<\/sup>Smad4<sup>pc-\/-<\/sup> and PC3M cells. Furthermore, both transcriptomic and functional analyses identified <i>RUNX2<\/i> as a transcriptional target of <i>THRB<\/i>. In summary, we identify a novel mechanism of <i>THRB<\/i>-mediated tumor progression and drug resistance in PCa cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Epidemiologic evidence indicates a higher incidence of PCa in men with elevated thyroid hormone levels. Accordingly, our results suggest a new mechanism for thyroid hormone signaling regulating metastasis potential and drug resistance. This study will provide a new perspective to identify the signals from the TME that may increase the risk of PCa progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/80653c84-78ec-4caa-b416-7633d9d5dbdd\/@x03B8ZX8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Bone metastasis,Drug resistance,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yan Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gurrapu Harsha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhiraj Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josue Curto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaobo Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filippo Giancotti<\/i><\/presenter>.

Early dissemination of tumor cells undergoing a protected period of dormancy in the target organs potentially explains this prevalent clinical behavior. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in various biological processes and diseases. Malat1 is one of the most abundant and highly conserved nuclear lncRNAs and have shown the associated with metastasis and serving as a predictive marker for various tumor progression. However, the correlation of tumor intrinsic lncRNAs in regulation of tumor dormancy and immune evasion are largely unknown.<b> <\/b>Using an in vivo screening platform for the isolation of genetic entities involved in either dormancy or reactivation of breast cancer tumor cells, we have identified Malat1 as a positive mediator of metastatic reactivation. To dissect the functional role of Malat1 in metastatic reactivation, we developed a clean Malat1 knockout (KO) model using paired gRNA CRISPR-Cas9 in metastatic murine syngeneic breast cancer. As a proof of concept, we also used inducible knockdown system under in vivo models. To delineate the immune microenvironment, we used single cell RNA-seq, ChIRP-seq, multicolor flowcytometry, RNA-FISH, and coculture experiments.<b> <\/b>Our data revealed that deletion of Malat1 induces dormancy and attenuated the metastatic colonization resulting in long-term survival of syngeneic mice model. In contrast, overexpression of Malat1 leads to metastatic reactivation of dormant breast cancer cells. Interestingly, 4T1-Malat1 KO dormant breast cancer cells exhibit metastatic outgrowth in T cells defective mice. Our single-cell RNA-seq and multicolor flowcytometry evaluation reveal enhanced T cells and reduced neutrophils proportions in mice with Malat1 KO cells. This indicates a critical role of immune microenvironment via Malat1-dependent immune evasion. Additionally, Malat1 KO inhibits cancer stemness properties. Similarly, RNA-seq and ChIRP-seq data suggest that KO of Malat1 hampers immune evasion and downregulates metastasis associated genes including Serpins and Wnts. Additionally, our data strongly suggests that Malat1 KO cells persists as non-proliferative dormant cells in lung due to CD8+ T cell-umpired immune activity. Our mechanistic studies showed that Malat1 regulated Sepinb6b blocks the CstG enzymatic activity and suppress cleavage of GsdmD and T cells induced pyroptosis. Interestingly, rescue experiments suggest that Malat1 or Serpinb6b protects T cell-induced cell death and induces dormancy re-awakening thereby rescue the metastatic potential of 4T1 Malat1 KO cells. Combination of Malat1 ASO with double immune checkpoint inhibitors greatly affects the metastatic outgrowth in breast cancer.<b> <\/b>Taken together, our studies demonstrate that tumor intrinsic Malat1 regulates Serpinb6b that suppresses CstG-GsdmD mediated pyroptosis which eventually promotes immune evasion and breast cancer dormancy metastatic reactivation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6ae2f335-fca8-48e1-a5d3-a4da2eb7ee09\/@x03B8ZX8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Cancer progression,Metastasis,lncRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dhiraj Kumar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filippo Giancotti<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, a systematic evaluation of the proposed CSC in paired human primary and recurrent glioblastoma has been lacking and whether they represent a unified cell type with conserved features over tumor evolution is unresolved. In this study, we used human patient derived xenografts (PDX) to investigate the status of these cells in patients following therapeutics and recurrence. Firstly, to ensure the fidelity of tumor heterogeneity in serially passaged orthotopic GBM PDX, we collected samples at different passages and performed whole tumor single cell RNA sequencing analysis. The results illustrate the preservation of all unsupervised transcriptional cell clusters through multiple passages. Furthermore, treatment of tumor bearing mice with temozolomide, the standard of care chemotherapeutic drug for glioblastoma patients, increased apoptosis and decreased tumor cell burden but spared CSC. We then turned to paired human primary and recurrent GBM samples to inquire cancer stem cell marker expression and cell distribution. In all three pairs of PDX studied, cancer stem cell marker F3 serves as a reliable means to isolate sphere formation cells and is augmented in the recurrent samples. Inspection of whole tumors with single cell RNA sequencing nails down the enrichment of CSC in recurrent tumors, thus emphasizing the importance to eradicate these cells in future therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d98689dc-e233-4efb-a550-fd97d7b11879\/@x03B8ZX8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cell,Chemotherapy,Recurrence,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xuanhua Peter Xie<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mungunsarnai Ganbold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alicia Pedraza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Parada<\/i><\/presenter>.
