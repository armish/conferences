[{"Abstract":"Introduction: BioEclipse Therapeutics has developed CRX100 an adoptive NK-T Cells therapy combined with vaccinia vvDD, an oncolytic virus. vvDD is a Western Reserve (WR) strain vaccinia virus (VACV) that has been further attenuated by the removal of the viral thymidine kinase and growth factor genes, and hence its replication and lytic activity is confined to tumor cells. In preclinical studies in immunocompetent mice the combined therapy eradicated tumor cells and initiated an adaptive immune response.<br \/>Trial Design: Our ongoing phase 1 safety clinical trial (IND 19222 at Clinicaltrials.gov) began in January 2021 and includes planned treatment of approximately 24 patients with the potential for 2 doses each. With the dose of ex vivo activated autologous NK-T cells held constant (2-5 X 10<sup>9<\/sup>), the dose of vvD is increased at 5 dose levels, 3X10<sup>7<\/sup>, 1x10<sup>8<\/sup>, 3x10<sup>8<\/sup>, 1x10<sup>9<\/sup> and 3x10<sup>9<\/sup> pfu\/dose. The first five doses are accelerated in cohorts of one patient and followed by a non-accelerated phase with a cohort of two patients and then 3 cohorts of three patients to determine the MTD, with an additional 8 patients then treated at the MTD. Dose limiting toxicities evaluated by a BOIN design will assist in the dose decision for phase 2.<br \/>Inclusion and exclusion criteria: Patients will have tumor progression and have failed standard of care in the indications, triple negative breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer or osteosarcoma.<br \/>Results: To date, 4 patients have been treated, including 2 patients with ovarian cancer and 2 with CRC at 4 dose levels. No dose limiting toxicities have been observed. The most common AE is mild fever at 6-12 hours after infusion. Two CRC patients treated at a vvDD dose of 3x10<sup>7 <\/sup>and 1x10<sup>9<\/sup> experienced disease progression. Patient 101-005 with ovarian cancer received two separate infusions 3 months apart each at a dose of 1x10<sup>8<\/sup> PFU vvDD combined with 2-5 X 10<sup>9<\/sup> ex-vivo activated autologous NKT. Tumor assessment after the first dose showed stable disease (+17.2%) by iRECIST. The CA125 serum biomarker increased temporarily about 3 weeks after infusion. The second ovarian patient (101-007) treated with 3x10<sup>8 <\/sup>vvDD combined with 2-5 X 10<sup>9<\/sup> ex-vivo activated autologous NKT had unconfirmed progression (+21%). There was a slight increase and then a decrease of the CA-125 from 303 to 268. The patient developed new ascites 4 weeks after infusion and required a paracentesis. The ascites did not recur after the paracentesis.<br \/>Conclusion: Thus far in escalation, all doses of the therapy have been safe and well-tolerated. Two patients with ovarian cancer treated with the adoptive NKT cell therapy combined with an oncolytic virus demonstrated changes in CA-125 potentially consistent with immune inflammation. Peripheral blood obtained at 3 and 6 month will be analyzed to assess specific immune responses. Dose escalation and enrollment continue for this study.<br\/><br\/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ba0faf6-06ff-4822-8c74-51fe648af05a\/@H03B8ZYe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Phase I,Immune cells,Vaccinia virus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20194"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Oliver Dorigo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pamela Reilly Contag<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Moser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandip Pravin Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark W.

In animals, SQ3370 enhanced T-cell infiltration, survival, and showed activity in both injected and non-injected lesions. Minimal to no toxicity, including no cardiotoxicity was seen in up to 9-fold dose increases in animals. Conventional Dox can induce cardiomyopathy with incidences of 6-20% for cumulative doses of 500 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> in humans. Here we report interim results of the Phase 1 trial (SQ3370-001; NCT04106492).<br \/>Methods: SQ3370 has 2 components: 1) Intratumoral injection of a protodrug-activating biopolymer (SQL70); 2) then 5 consecutive daily IV infusions of an attenuated protodrug of Dox (SQP33). Key criteria for enrollment include locally advanced to metastatic solid tumors, &#8804;300 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> prior exposure to DOX, ECOG status 0 or 1, and no limit to the number of prior systemic therapies. Primary objectives include safety and determining Phase 2 dose. Dose escalation was assessed in 2 stages: 1) accelerated titration; 2) 3+3 design. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated in cycle 1.<br \/>Results: As of 26NOV2021 data cut, 17 patients (pts) in 8 dose escalation cohorts have been enrolled. MTD has not been reached. Median age was 59 years (26-79), 53% were females, and were ECOG 1 (59%). Prior procedures included surgery (82%) and radiation (47%). At study entry, 82% of pts had metastases with a median number of metastatic sites being 2 (1-5). Solid tumors were sarcoma (65%), and cancers of the skin, breast, and gynecologic organs were 12% for each, respectively. Sixteen of 17 (94%) pts received prior chemotherapy with 47% receiving prior Dox. Median number of prior systemic therapies was 2 (1-7). Intratumoral injection sites include soft tissue and chest wall. Of the 17 pts, 65% received &#62;500 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, 53% (&#62;1000), and 29% (&#62;2000) cumulative Dox given as SQP33. Median duration of treatment was 3 cycles (1-10). No DLTs were observed. Most frequent AEs, regardless of causality, included nausea (n = 9), fatigue (n = 6) and anemia (n = 5). No signs of cardiomyopathy were seen in pts with an echo performed within 1 mo. of study start. Although &#62;50% of pts received &#62;1000 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, ejection fraction (LVEF) remained normal. No AEs that led to discontinuation or death were related to SQ3370. All pts were evaluable for response. At a median follow-up of 10 wks (4-30), 65% of pts had SD as best response. Median duration of SD was 80 days (37-186) with 64% sustaining SD for &#8805;60 days, corresponding to an overall disease control rate of 65%. The remainder of pts had PD as best response. Over 35% of pts remain on drug.<br \/>Conclusions: SQ3370 was well tolerated. No DLTs and normal LVEF were seen with pts receiving &#62;1000 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> Dox cumulative doses. Dose escalation is ongoing. Preliminary evidence of disease control was observed in this heavily pre-treated, high cancer burden, solid tumor pt population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e34e62e-65f3-4f07-8358-c877be563b36\/@H03B8ZYe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Targeted therapy,Solid tumors,Safety,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20195"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sant P.

Occurrence of intratumoral senescence harbors broad therapeutic implications and may limit the prognosis of cancer patients, as senescent cells, via their senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), can suppress anti-tumour immune responses and may increase the metastatic potential of non-senescent cancer cells. Preclinical data suggest that an eradication of senescent cells (senolytic therapies) or an application of SASP modulating therapies might improve the outcome of systemic cancer therapies, however, as a prerequisite to guide such approaches, robust and non-invasive modalities to visualize and quantify intratumoral senescence are needed.Here we report on the preclinical and clinical development of the novel Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET) tracer [18F]FPyGal, a radiolabeled substrate of senescence-associated &#42933;-galactosidase. After thorough preclinical characterization of [18F]FPyGal in mouse models of TIS, we conducted a phase I study (NCT04536454) to assess i) safety and tolerability of [18F]FPyGal (primary endpoints) and ii) to characterize dosimetry and pharmacokinetics (secondary endpoints) as well as possible regions of physiologically increased tracer uptake after i.v. injection of [18F]FPyGal (mean 372.5&#177;9.6) MBq in eight male healthy volunteers (mean 35.0&#177;9.6 y; range 26-53 y). No treatment related adverse events (trAEs) or severe adverse events (SAEs) were recorded. No abnormal findings or changes were noted on physical examinations, vital signs and pulse oximetry values. Except for a transient reduction in leukocyte and neutrophil counts (6 h p.i.) in one patient (12.5%), no other abnormal laboratory values were observed. The total body absorbed dose was 4.40&#177;0.08 &#181;Gy\/MBq, highest mean absorbed doses were found in the urinary bladder wall (81.55&#177;1.06 &#181;Gy\/MBq), kidneys (21.05&#177;4.74 &#181;Gy\/MBq) and heart wall (9.77&#177;1.32 &#181;Gy\/MBq). The normalized whole-body effective radiation dose was 8.09&#177;0.17 &#181;Sv\/MBq. Collectively, our data show that i) [18F]FPyGal can robustly detect intratumoral senescence in preclinical cancer mouse models and ii) that the use of [18F]FPyGal was safe and well-tolerated in the described human study population. Radiation exposure was low and comparable to other clinically available 18F-labelled PET-tracers. In a second stage of our phase I trial, we are currently correlating [18F]FPyGal PET signals with histopathological senescence markers in human cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc056bf9-970b-48c3-b1cb-cf67a9abe71a\/@H03B8ZYe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL01-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,Positron emission tomography (PET),Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20196"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Christian LaFougere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brigitte Gueckel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helmut Dittmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Hinterleitner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nils Trautwein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Cotton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriele Kienzle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephan Singer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerald Reischl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrich Lauer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernd Pichler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Lars Zender<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Cancer cells neutralize TNF&#945; by shedding soluble TNF receptors 1&#38;2 (sTNF-Rs), which act as TNF&#945;-binding decoys, promoting cancer cell proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance. Immunopheresis&#174; employs therapeutic apheresis with the selective immunoadsorption LW-02 column (LW-02) for treating solid malignancies. LW-02-based Immunopheresis (granted FDA Breakthrough Device Designation and a CE Mark for mTNBC) selectively removes sTNF-Rs from plasma, permitting TNF&#945; to bind to membrane-bound TNF-Rs, activating intracellular death pathways, and also modulate T-cell-mediated immune activity. Part A data of our phase I\/II clinical trial in metastatic, chemorefractory, triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) patients (NCT04004910) confirmed that LW-02-based Immunopheresis monotherapy is safe and well-tolerated, with signs of disease stabilization (SD) in patients treated &#62;4 weeks. Here we present interim data on the safety and preliminary efficacy of LW-02 Immunopheresis combined with chemotherapy.<br \/>Methods: LW-02 Immunopheresis (3x\/week for 16 weeks) is combined with a weekly paclitaxel (80 mg\/m2)+carboplatin (AUC 2) regimen in patients with mTNBC; treatment is continued past 16 weeks in clinical and\/or objective responders. Primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints assessed in patients treated &#62;4 weeks include overall survival, tumor response according to RECIST, rate of CNS progression and quality-of-life.<br \/>Results: Of 11 patients enrolled in Part B of the study, 7 patients were treated for &#62;4 weeks. The ORR was 18% (1CR, 1PR) with one additional patient experiencing SD; the ORR and CBR in patients treated &#62;4 weeks were 29% and 43%, respectively. The median OS, to date, is 18.6 weeks and 26.7 weeks in the group treated &#62;4 weeks. The rate of CNS progression (new or preexisting lesions) appears lower than expected. The most common adverse events (AEs) were chemotherapy-induced myelotoxicity (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and transient electrolyte abnormalities. Thirty-one serious AEs (SAEs) were reported for all 11 patients, 15 (48.4%) were transfusion requiring anemias. Of the SAEs, 3 (9.6%) were judged to have a potential causal relationship to LW-02 column Immunopheresis.<br \/>Conclusion: LW-02-based Immunopheresis combined with weekly chemotherapy is generally safe, well-tolerated and highly effective in specific sTNFR subtraction on a longer-term basis, with promising signals of clinical benefit in heavily pretreated mTNBC patients (median 3.3 [2-5] prior lines of systemic therapy). Further clinical evaluation of the antitumor activity of LW-02-based immunopheresis combined with low-dose chemotherapy is ongoing with a focus on quality-of-life and prevention of CNS disease progression, the latter especially important in chemorefractory mTNBC, given the high prevalence of CNS involvement.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1f8859c8-e264-45f5-be2b-a914b6ba96c9\/@H03B8ZYe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),TNF-&#945;,Chemosensitization,Synergism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20197"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Piotr Jan Wysocki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Ostrowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Segal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victoria Manax<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pawel Potocki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kamil Konopka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukasz Kwinta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paulina Fraczek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maciej Lubas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mateusz Lobacz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lawrence Florin<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the ongoing phase 1 trial (NCT02964013), we evaluated the safety and efficacy of these drugs given in combination (vibo + pembro) or as a coformulation (vibo\/pembro) for the treatment of ovarian cancer naive to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: Patients had locally advanced unresectable or metastatic ovarian cancer naive to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors that progressed after &#8805;1 line of therapy, including platinum therapy. Patients were nonrandomly assigned to receive vibo (200 mg IV Q3W) + pembro (200 mg IV Q3W) or as the coformulation (vibo\/pembro) at the same dose for &#8804;35 cycles (~2 years) or until disease progression (PD), toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Primary end points were safety and tolerability. Secondary and exploratory end points included PK, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator review per RECIST v1.1. PD-L1 positivity was defined as a combined positive score (CPS) of &#8805;1 or when CPS was missing, as a tumor proportion score of &#8805;1% or as a mononuclear immune cell density score of &#8805;2.<br \/>Results: Of 61 patients enrolled, 21 received vibo + pembro, and 40 received vibo\/pembro. Median age was 58 years; 48% of patients had ECOG performance status 1, 15% had <i>BRCA1 <\/i>and\/or <i>BRCA2 <\/i>mutations, 87% received &#8805;2 lines of prior therapy (66%, bevacizumab; 41%, PARP inhibitor), and 74% had platinum-resistant disease (PD &#60;6 months after platinum). PD-L1 status was positive in 21 patients, negative in 31 patients, and unknown in 9 patients. Median follow-up was 13 months (range, 9-15). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 79% of all patients; 13% were grade 3 or 4. No deaths due to TRAEs were reported. The most common TRAEs (&#8805;20%) were fatigue (23%), pruritus (23%), and rash (20%). PK exposure was similar between treatment groups. ORR was 8% (95% CI, 3-18) in all patients and 24% (95% CI, 8-47) in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors. Median DOR was 19 months (range, 4-19). The disease control rate at 6 months was 11% (95% CI, 5-22) in all patients and 24% (95% CI, 8-47) in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors. Median PFS was 2 months (95% CI, 2-2) in all patients and 2 months (95% CI, 2-8) in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Safety and PK were comparable with vibo + pembro combination and the vibo\/pembro coformulation in patients with platinum-resistant locally advanced unresectable or metastatic ovarian cancer naive to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors. Antitumor activity was equivalent between the combination and coformulation, with responses limited to PD-L1-positive tumors. Vibo\/pembro coformulation may offer a safe and convenient treatment option in these patients; further investigations of antitumor activity by PD-L1 status are needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/387fd21a-15ed-4841-8f8f-4ada84b03d8e\/@H03B8ZYe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anti-PD-1,Pembrolizumab,TIGIT,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20198"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"f6947a0e-7169-464d-86e3-1e9d657f8d73","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6947a0e-7169-464d-86e3-1e9d657f8d73\/@H03B8ZYe\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ruth Perets<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Gutierrez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Young Rha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Taylor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Stein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonio Jimeno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ira Winer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanya Keenan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohini Rajasagi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mallika Lala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jane Healy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronnie Shapira-Frommer<\/i><\/presenter>.

The use of mutation-derived neoepitopes to design cancer vaccines is an unprecedented opportunity to target efficient antigens, but the stochastic occurrence of mutations implies that a tailored vaccine needs to be designed and manufactured for each patient. We used next generation sequencing, machine learning based genomic data analysis and advances in genome editing to systematically identify private neoepitopes in high-risk HPV negative HNSCC and relapsing OvC patients.<br \/>Methods: Mutations were identified by DNA and RNA sequencing and putative epitopes were selected for vaccine design on their likelihood to elicit a class I or II response based on HLA binding, allelic frequency, prediction of processing and expression at RNA level. The vaccine was a recombinant virus of the modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) strain encoding for up to 30 sequences of 29 amino acids centred on the predicted epitope and flanked with the normal germline sequence in case of missense mutations, and of the mutated protein sequence in case of frameshift mutations. The viral vaccine was amplified under GMP conditions and administered to patients after curative intent treatment in two phase I trials. Treatment was started for OvC patients at relapse defined as elevation of CA-125 or onset of suspicious radiological findings and, after first line therapy for HNSCC patients with locally advanced disease with either extracapsular extension or positive resection margins following upfront surgery. The vaccine was administered for 6 weeks and a booster dose every three weeks over a year, in absence of other cancer therapy.<br \/>Results: Six patients (4 OvC and 2 HNSCC) were treated and experienced only mild related adverse events. After 6 doses of vaccine, we measured immunoreactive T cells in PBMCs against each of the targeted epitopes using an ex vivo IFN&#947; ELISPOT showed robust responses in all evaluable patients. Positive responses to vaccination were observed for a total of 46 epitopes over 115 tested with a median of 11 epitopes (6 to 18) per patient. Responses were directed against both class I and II epitopes and were either <i>de novo<\/i> responses (64%) or amplification of pre-existing responses (36%). In parallel, phenotyping of patient PBMCs showed, in all treated patients, a decline in na&#239;ve CD4 and CD8 cells and the onset of effector CD27<sup>-<\/sup> CD4 and CD27<sup>-<\/sup>\/CD57<sup>+<\/sup> CD8; similarly, CD56<sup>dim<\/sup> NK cells increased suggesting a stimulation of antitumor innate immunity. In one ovarian cancer patient, these immune changes correlated with a normalization of CA-125 that lasted 7 months.<br \/>Conclusions: These data show that the personalized approach with TG4050 is feasible, safe and immunogenic. The two phase I trials are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5dd37790-9186-4971-8e32-8dcfdbb66a83\/@H03B8ZYe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Ovarian cancer,Head and neck cancers,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20200"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew S.

In preclinical models, IT IL-12 mRNA led to IFN&#947; release and CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor regression and potentiated PD-L1 blockade. MEDI1191, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated mRNA encoding IL-12 delivered by IT injection, drives IL-12 production and enhances antitumor immune response with improved tolerability. We hypothesized that combining MEDI1191 with PD-L1 blockade would augment antitumor immunity <i>in vivo<\/i>. Here we report updated results from the dose-escalation phase of the first-in-human study of IT MEDI1191 and IV durvalumab (D; anti-PD-L1) for advanced\/metastatic solid tumors (NCT03946800).<br \/>Methods: In this multicenter, open-label study, MEDI1191 was dosed sequentially (seq, Part 1A) or concurrently (conc, Part 1B) with D. In Part 1A, MEDI1191 was given IT on Days 1 and 22 followed by D 1500 mg on day 43 and then Q4W IV. In Part 1B, MEDI1191 was given IT on Days 1, 29, 57 and then Q8W, along with D on Day 1 and then Q4W. Treatment continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 2 years. Eligible adult pts had any solid tumor with cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions suitable for IT injection and progression on standard therapy for recurrent\/metastatic disease. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability and determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary objectives included preliminary antitumor activity by RECIST v1.1.<br \/>Results: Starting in May 2019, 31 pts received seq MEDI1191 with D (Part 1A cohorts 0.1-12 &#956;g; n=20) or conc MEDI1191 with D (Part 1B cohorts 1.0-3.0 &#956;g; n=11); 23 pts had received prior anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 therapy. Most common tumor types were melanoma, n=8; head and neck cancer, n=4; and breast cancer, n=4. At the data cutoff of Dec 7, 2021, there were no dose-limiting toxicities and no MTD was identified. One pt (3.2%) had a Gr &#8805;3 MEDI1191-related AE (Gr 3 pyrexia, resolved within 24 hr) and 1 (3.2%) had a MEDI1191-related serious AE (SAE; Gr 2 confusion). Two pts had Gr 3 D-related AEs (6.5%, pyrexia also related to MEDI1191 and pruritus; each n=1); none had a D-related SAE. There were no Gr 4 related AEs. 3 pts had partial responses (PR): 1 with head and neck cancer (unconfirmed, off study) and 2 with anti-PD-1 resistant melanoma (1 confirmed, &#62;12 months on treatment; 1 unconfirmed, off study); 10 pts had stable disease (including the 2 unconfirmed PRs). Among pts with available biomarker data (up to 3 &#956;g in Part 1A and 1 &#956;g in Part 1B), MEDI1191 increased serum IL-12 in 15\/17 pts, increased CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration by <u>&#62;<\/u>2-fold in 8\/14 pts and increased tumor PD-L1 expression in 6\/14 pts.<br \/>Conclusions: IT MEDI1191 plus systemic anti-PD-L1 was safe and feasible.

The most common on-target <i>EGFR<\/i> resistance mutation is at the EGFR C797 residue (i.e., C797S), which prevents covalent binding to 3G EGFR TKIs. While 3G TKIs are effective in patients with <i>EGFR<\/i> activating and T790M mutations (commonly seen post-progression after first-\/second-generation TKIs), there are no targeted therapies approved after their failure. BLU-945 is an investigational, reversible, and selective next-generation EGFR TKI intended for use as a single agent or in combination with other agents to suppress activating and on-target resistance EGFR mutants, including T790M and C797S, while sparing wildtype (wt) EGFR. BLU-945 has shown <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity in 3G EGFR TKI-na&#239;ve as well as resistant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft models with EGFR T790M and C797S mutations. Based on this, we started SYMPHONY (NCT04862780), a phase 1\/2 study in patients with metastatic <i>EGFRm<\/i> NSCLC, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and\/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); and to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of BLU-945.<br \/>Methods: In the ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation part of the study, patients aged &#8805;18 years with metastatic <i>EGFRm<\/i> NSCLC previously treated with &#8805;1 EGFR TKI (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2) received BLU-945 once daily (QD) on a 28-day cycle following a Bayesian Optimal Interval escalation design. Adverse events (AEs), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), PK, ctDNA (in real-time using FoundationOne Liquid panel), and radiographic antitumor activity (by RECIST 1.1 criteria) were assessed in the first 4 treatment cohorts.<br \/>Results: As of the January 7, 2022, data cut, 18 patients have been treated with BLU-945 at 25-200 mg QD. Of these, 14 (77.8%) patients had received &#8805;2 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting. There were no DLTs, and most AEs were low grade. Treatment-related AEs (all Grade 1) occurred in 8 (44.4%) patients with the most common being nausea (n=3). <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation allele fraction assessment by ctDNA at C1D1 and C1D15 showed that tumors were heterogeneous at baseline. At doses of 50 mg QD and higher, reductions in <i>EGFR <\/i>resistance mutation allele fraction were seen in all patients (n=3) with <i>EGFR <\/i>C797S (n=2) and\/or T790M (n=3) resistance mutations, with a median 48% reduction of these mutations. 50% of patients remain on treatment and dose escalation continues to determine the RP2D.<br \/>Conclusion: As of the data cut, BLU-945 was generally well tolerated in heavily pre-treated patients with <i>EGFRm<\/i> NSCLC. There was also early evidence of a reduction in <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation allele fractions by ctDNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/69e2d9c6-097c-4103-a3bb-2e776e0a0a6b\/@H03B8ZYe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,EGFR,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20202"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"83d0f3af-160a-4b60-9641-d989ecded215","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/83d0f3af-160a-4b60-9641-d989ecded215\/@H03B8ZYe\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elaine Shum<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasir Elamin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen L.

Tegavivint (BC2059) selectively disrupts the interaction of &#946;-catenin and TBL1\/TBLR1 resulting in the specific degradation of nuclear &#946;-catenin. The primary objective of this dose escalation study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of tegavivint.<br \/>Methods: This phase I study (<i>NCT03459469<\/i>) utilized an accelerated dose escalation phase for the initial two dose levels followed by a 3+3 design to determine the MTD\/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The study included adult patients with desmoid tumors that were progressive (20% increase in tumor volume, recurrent in one year from surgery or desmoid symptoms), unresectable, and measurable via WHO criteria. Patients were excluded if they had familial adenomatous polyposis, metabolic bone disease, or history of significant pulmonary disease. Tegavivint was administered IV and dosed weekly (three weeks on, one week off) for up to two years.<br \/>Results: A total of 17 patients with a median age of 41 years (range 18-66 years) were enrolled in six dose levels from 0.5 mg\/kg to 5 mg\/kg. The median time from initial desmoid diagnosis to study treatment was 2.1 years with a median of one prior systemic treatment (range 0-6). Prior radiation and\/or surgical resection occurred in 42% (n=7). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and the MTD was not determined. The RP2D was declared at 5 mg\/kg based on achieving pharmacologically relevant plasma concentrations and preliminary efficacy. Trough plasma concentrations (C<sub>min<\/sub>) exceeded <i>in vitro <\/i>IC<sub>50 <\/sub>efficacy estimates at 4 mg\/kg and 5 mg\/kg. Median half-life was 38 hours supporting once weekly administration. Tegavivint exposure (AUC and C<sub>max<\/sub>) correlated with total dose administered. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurring in &#8805;20% of patients included fatigue (71%), nausea (35%), headache (35%), decreased appetite (24%) and dysgeusia (24%), mostly Grade 1-2. Grade 3 TRAEs of hypophosphatemia, stomatitis, ALT increased, and headache occurred in 4 separate patients. No grade 4-5 adverse events were observed. One serious adverse event of Grade 2 infusion site extravasation occurred. Median time on study was 11.8 months, with a median relative dose intensity of 97%; one patient remains on study. Three (18%) partial responses (WHO criteria) were observed at 1, 4 and 5 mg\/kg with a median duration of response of 329 days and all responses were ongoing. The clinical benefit rate was 82% (n = 14).<br \/>Conclusions: Tegavivint is well tolerated with mostly Grade 1\/2 adverse events and no Grade 3 TRAEs occurring in more than one patient. The preliminary objective response rate of 18% in progressive desmoid tumors warrants continued research in the ongoing dose expansion portion of the study at the 5 mg\/kg RP2D.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8d434509-dc55-41c0-8707-d513e1265e9e\/@H03B8ZYe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"&#946;-catenin,Phase I,Wnt pathway and TBL1\/TBLR1,Desmoid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20203"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lee Cranmer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albiruni A.

In xenograft models, CFT7455 has more potent IKZF1\/3 degradation compared to other degraders. Early observations from the FIH clinical trial (NCT04756726) along with supporting translational studies are presented here.<br \/>Methods: Pre-clinical studies comparing CFT7455 and CC-92480 in both in vitro and xenograft models were performed. The pre-clinical studies&#8217; results coincided with observations from the on-going clinical trial. The clinical trial is an open-label, Phase 1\/2, multi-center, FIH study in heavily pretreated relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) MM and non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) patients evaluating safety, tolerability, and PK of CFT7455. Eligible MM patients are R\/R to therapy and are not candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit. A starting dose of 50 &#956;g QD 21 days on\/7 days off (21\/7) in 28-day cycles was administered.<br \/>Results: CFT7455 and CC-92480 showed similar cereblon binding profiles and in vitro IKZF1\/3 degradation kinetics, translating into sub-nanomolar GI<sub>50<\/sub> values in proliferation assays across a panel of MM cell lines. In the NCI-H929 xenograft model, 100 &#956;g\/kg\/day of CFT7455 resulted in durable tumor regressions, while 1000 &#956;g\/kg\/day of CC-92480 gave tumor stasis. Similar results were seen in a systemic model of MM, MM1.S. Both compounds achieved &#62;95% IKZF3 degradation in tumors 4h post dose. At 48h post dose, CFT7455 was more effective than CC-92480 in maintaining IKZF3 degradation (65% vs. 6% respectively). When levels of CFT7455 and CC-92480 in plasma and tumor were compared, CFT7455 concentrations were &#62; DC80 in tumor 48h post dose, while CC-92480 levels were undetectable in tumor and plasma, demonstrating CFT7455 has longer exposure resulting in sustained IKZF1\/3 degradation in pre-clinical models.<br \/>In cohort A, 5 heavily pre-treated MM patients (pts) received single agent CFT7455. 4 pts have received at least 3 cycles, with 2 pts receiving 5 cycles. Neutropenia (grade 4) was observed in 3\/5 pts without coincident fever or infection. Additionally, a 2-4 fold accumulation in plasma CFT7455 exposure at steady state was observed. Early pharmacodynamic (PD) data demonstrates deep persistent degradation of IKZF3 (~100%) and serum free light chain reduction (up to 72%) in response to treatment. Stable disease has been observed in 34 pts, suggesting clinical benefit.<br \/>Conclusions: While CFT7455 showed clinical benefit at 50 ug with deep target degradation, neutropenia was dose limiting. PK\/PD modeling suggests alternative dosing regimens may result in increased tolerability with preserved efficacy, and evaluation of them is underway. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ae00e8f-5b4c-45c0-ac2b-9e071025b34d\/@z03B8ZYf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,IKAROS,Aiolos,protein degrader,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20204"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"7c98d4c9-adc8-445f-8ab6-fb6317cf0bca","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7c98d4c9-adc8-445f-8ab6-fb6317cf0bca\/@z03B8ZYf\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sagar Lonial<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shambavi Richard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey V Matous<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew J.

RTX-240 is designed to activate and expand CD8+ memory T cells and NK cells and is restricted to the normal biodistribution of red blood cells to mitigate toxicity. Safety, pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy of RTX-240 were assessed in a Phase 1 study of pts with solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: Pts with relapsed\/refractory solid tumors not eligible for standard therapy were treated with monotherapy RTX-240 in 10 cohorts utilizing 6 dose levels (1x10<sup>8<\/sup>-5x10<sup>10<\/sup> cells per dose) and 4 different schedules until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Peripheral blood and tumor tissue were collected at baseline and on-treatment.<br \/>Results: As of Dec 3, 2021, 30 pts with solid tumors (median age 58 yr, range 23-80, 17 males, 20 ECOG 1), were treated with single agent RTX-240. Pts had previously received a median of 3 therapies (range, 1-9); 21 pts had received prior PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitor (i) therapy. Common tumor types included NSCLC (n=7), melanoma (n=7), colorectal\/lower GI (n=4) and RCC (n=3). Per RECIST v1.1, a confirmed partial response (PR) was observed in 1 pt with anal carcinoma and an unconfirmed PR in a uveal melanoma, both of whom had been previously treated with a PD-1. Disease control (PR or stable disease &#62; 12 weeks) occurred in 11\/30 pts (37%), of which 7 had received a prior PD-1 for a median of 8 months. Peripheral blood PD studies demonstrate activation, expansion, and cytotoxic potential (GzB) of both NK and memory CD8+ T cells. Every pt with evaluable samples (n=29) had an increase in at least one of the activation or expansion parameters, and the majority had an increase in all. There was also a clear dose response effect in NK cell numbers and trends in other PD markers. Immune activation was observed by increases in plasma IFN-&#947; in a subset of patients. On-treatment biopsies in a subset (3\/5) of evaluable pts show infiltration of NK and\/or T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME) after RTX-240 dosing. No DLTs or related grade (Gr)<u>&#62;<\/u>3 AEs were seen. The most common treatment-related AEs (Gr 1-2) were fatigue (n = 6); chills, nausea, decrease in appetite, arthralgia (n =3); and fever, myalgia, dysgeusia, and hyperhidrosis (n=2). Additional Gr 2 irAEs include pneumonitis, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and worsening transaminitis.<br \/>Conclusions: RTX-240 is well tolerated at all tested doses, schedules and routes. The drug leads to activation, expansion and trafficking of two target cells (memory CD8+ T cells and NK cells) into the TME, exhibits a clear dose response effect with NK cells and demonstrates preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity. Dose escalation continues and a PD-1 inhibitor combination arm is also enrolling.<br \/>1","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd38f6f1-68ec-4413-af66-377b4b4cb4e9\/@z03B8ZYf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Phase I,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20205"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Omid Hamid<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa L.

Butyrophilin 3A is a novel checkpoint molecule required to activate &#947;9&#948;2 T cells highly expressed on immune and malignant cells, and the target of a monoclonal antibody ICT01. ICT01 induces activation\/migration of &#947;9&#948;2 T cells from the blood to induce immune remodeling of the tumor microenvironment at doses &#8805;700 &#956;g being tested in the ongoing EVICTION clinical trial (NCT04243499) (AACR 2021, CT034). In vitro studies showed that ICT01 induces upregulation of PD-1 on &#947;9&#948;2 T cells and that the combination with pembrolizumab leads to enhanced cancer cell killing, providing scientific rationale for evaluating this combination.<br \/>Methods: EVICTION is an ongoing Phase 1\/2a, international, open-label trial with Group C assessing ICT01 (IV Q3W) plus pembrolizumab (200mg IV Q3W) in patients with bladder cancer, HNSCC, melanoma, or NSCLC who failed &#8805;1 CPI. Pharmacodynamic activity was monitored by immunophenotyping and cytokine level analysis. Tumor biopsies (baseline, Day 28) were used for immunohistochemistry of BTN3A and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and gene expression profiling. Efficacy evaluations by i\/RECIST 1.1 were conducted every 8 weeks.<br \/>Results: Five Group C patient cohorts have been enrolled and treated with ICT01 doses of 700&#956;g, 2mg, 7mg, 20mg or 75mg (n=30) plus pembrolizumab, with the 200mg ICT01 cohort enrolling currently. To date, no DLTs have been observed with the combination. First-dose fever and chills (Grade 1\/2) were the most common AEs that increased in frequency up to 75mg (100%, n=6), without any increase in severity, and rarely recur with subsequent dosing. ICT01+pembrolizumab induced trafficking of &#62;95% of circulating &#947;9&#948;2 T cells within 30 min post ICT01 (&#8805;700 &#956;g), which was sustained for 21 days at 75mg. Transient, dose-dependent increases in serum cytokines at 30 min (TNF&#945;) or 4h (IFN&#947;) post-dose were correlated with baseline &#947;9&#948;2 T cell counts and returned to baseline by 24 hrs post dose. Baseline &#947;9&#948;2 T cell count also correlated with increases in tumor infiltration of &#947;&#948;, CD3, and CD8 T cells, confirming the ability to remodel the TME, and the potential to select\/enrich patients with higher baseline &#947;9&#948;2 T cell counts. Sixteen patients (9\/16 pembro-experienced, 5\/16 received &#62;1 prior CPI) were efficacy-evaluable at &#8805;Week 8 by RECIST1.1 at ICT01 doses up to 20 mg, with an observed disease control rate of 44% including 3 confirmed PRs beyond 6 months: bladder (2mg), melanoma (2mg), NSCLC (7mg). The Ipi\/Nivo-refractory melanoma patient with PR also achieving a CR on their non-target lesion brain metastasis at 6 months. Data from the 75 and 200mg cohorts will be presented.<br \/>Conclusion: The immune remodeling of the TME by ICT01-activated &#947;9&#948;2 T cells is associated with clinical benefit in CPI-experienced patients when used in combination with pembrolizumab. The selection of patients with higher baseline &#947;9&#948;2 T cells may improve the response profile to this novel therapeutic combination in CPI-failure patients, which will be tested in the Phase 2a portion of EVICTION starting in Q2 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1373fd5c-a477-4194-bc81-43c4dc33f4fc\/@z03B8ZYf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gamma-delta lymphocytes,Pembrolizumab,NSCLC,Brain metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20206"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephane Champiat<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Wermke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johann De Bono<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurelien Marabelle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christiane Jungels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cécile Vicier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norbert Vey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catrin List<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katrin Wetzko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leo Ruhnke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Garralda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vladimir Galvão de Aguiar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia LoRusso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nuria Kotecki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aude De Gassart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emmanuel Valentin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Brune<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Iché<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Céline Leparquier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Olive<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Frohna<\/i><\/presenter>.

Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists have long been recognized as potential systemic anti-cancer immunotherapy agents. However, clinical development has been limited by complex target-mediated pharmacology including those associated with elevated levels of proinflammatory factors, which also limit the ability to combine with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI). PRTX007 is an orally administered prodrug of PRX034, a novel TLR7 agonist that elicits IFN-mediated immune induction without inducing inflammation via the NF-&#954;&#946; pathway. QOD dosing in primates maintains a stable immune response without immune exhaustion or toxicity. Efficacy, safety, and compatibility with immune CPI were demonstrated in a CT26 syngeneic rodent tumor model.<br \/>Methods. We conducted a phase 1, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of 8 single-ascending dose (SAD) and 4 multiple-ascending dose (MAD) cohorts of PRTX007 administered orally to healthy adult participants. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives were evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics. This interim analysis focuses on the 8 SAD (50-600 mg) and 2 MAD (300-400 mg) cohorts, with 64 of the 84 participants in the study receiving drug.<br \/>Results. Treatment-related adverse events include non-dose&#8210;related mild headache, and minor dose-related increases in ALT (&#60;2X ULN) that rapidly resolved. The PKs of PRTX007 and PRX034 are well-behaved eg, exposure increasing proportionally with PRTX007 dose. Consistent with studies in human cells <i>in vitro <\/i>and non-human primates <i>in vivo<\/i>, oral administration of PRTX007 elicits systemic TLR7-mediated immune induction without engaging NF-&#954;&#946;&#9472;mediated biosynthesis of IL-6, TNF&#945; and IL-1&#946; in humans. A single dose of PRTX007 (300-600 mg) elicits coordinated expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in blood without quantifiable increases in circulating IFNs. At 500 and 600 mg doses, IP-10, IL-1RA, MCP-1 and TRAIL but not IL-6, TNF&#945; or IL-1&#946; increase in plasma (maximal response = 4020, 1460, 650 and 360 pg\/ml, respectively). When PRTX007 is administered for 2 weeks on a QOD schedule at 400 mg\/dose, the degree of ISG expression progressively increases when compared to the first-dose response, (eg, ISG15 increases 2.1-fold [geometric mean] following Dose 1 vs pretreatment baseline, rising to 12.2-fold following Dose 7). This is accompanied by modest activation of circulating NK, B, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as measured by cell-surface markers. IL-6, TNF&#945; and IL-1&#946; remain unchanged from pretreatment levels.<br \/>Conclusion.<b> <\/b>At the interim analysis, PRTX007 demonstrated a favorable safety profile when administered orally to all tested SAD and MAD cohorts. Dose-dependent systemic exposure was observed, as well as activation of the innate immune response, without production of proinflammatory factors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58f4174e-b8f1-43df-90a0-822220d1b8cd\/@z03B8ZYf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,TLR7,Phase I,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20207"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Charlotte Lemech<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Argent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Curtis Scribner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Daniels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Richard Appleman<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, some patients may not be eligible to receive autologous CAR-T. TruUCAR&#8482; GC502 is an allogeneic, universal CAR-T product with CD19\/CD7 dual directed CAR. Preclinical data of GC502 were reported at ASH 2021 (Abstract 148500). Here, we report early clinical results from a phase I open-label, non-randomized, prospective investigator initiate trial (IIT) of GC502 in r\/r B-ALL patients.<br \/>Methods: GC502 is manufactured using leukopaks from HLA-unmatched healthy donors. It contains a 4-1BB based CD19\/CD7 dual directing CAR, a T cell enhancer, and genetically disrupted <i>TRAC<\/i> and <i>CD7<\/i> loci to avoid GvHD and fratricide.<br \/>Patients (pts) with r\/r B-ALL were enrolled and treated with one of two different formulations (A or B) in escalating dose levels ranging from 1.0x10<sup>7 <\/sup>(DL1) to 1.5x10<sup>7<\/sup> (DL2) cells\/kg. Prior to infusion of GC502, pts received a Flu\/Cy based lymphodepletion regimen. Adverse events, disease response and expansion kinetics were evaluated in this study.<br \/>Results: To date, 4 pts (15-34 yrs) were enrolled from Sep. 2021 to Jan. 2022. All patients were heavily pretreated, and had received either autologous or donor derived CD19 or CD19-CD22 targeted CAR-T therapy. Baseline marrow blast levels ranged from 19.5% to 92% (median 48.1%). 1 pt had extramedullary involvement.<br \/>At data cut-off (Jan. 28, 2022), all patients had received a single dose of GC502: 1 pt at DL 1 1.0x10<sup>7<\/sup>cells\/kg and 3 patients at DL 2 1.5x10<sup>7<\/sup>cells\/kg. At day 28 post CAR-T infusion, 2 out of 3 response evaluable patients had achieved CR\/CRi; 1 pt achieved PR at month 1 and subsequently received HSCT on day 39.<br \/>TEAEs presented as Gr 3 febrile neutropenia (2\/3), Gr 4 thrombocytopenia (1\/3) and Gr 3 anemia (3\/3). All TEAE resolved after treatment with SOC. Non-hematological TEAE presented as Gr&#8804;3 &#947;-GT increase (3\/3), Gr&#8804;3 AST increase (2\/3) and Gr&#8804;3 ALT increase (3\/3). CRS presented as Gr 2 in 2 patients with formulation B. 2 pts received formulation A and experienced Gr 3 CRS with a duration of 7 and 10 days respectively (CRS was graded according ASTCT Consensus Grading). CRS in all pts was manageable and resolved after treatment with Ruxolitinib, SOC and supportive care. No ICANS or aGvHD were observed. The pt treated in DL 1 did not show adequate GC502 cellular expansion. Peak expansions of GC502 in peripheral blood were observed between week 1-2 in DL 2.

Inhibiting the pathway with a combination of BRAF\/CRAF and MEK inhibitors (LXH254 and TMT, respectively) has demonstrated synergistic activity in preclinical models of <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant melanoma.<br \/>Methods: We report data from an open-label, Phase Ib study (NCT02974725), that tested LXH254 + TMT combination in a dose-escalation (ESC) part in pts with <i>KRAS-<\/i> or <i>BRAF-<\/i>mutant NSCLC or <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant melanoma and in a dose-expansion (EXP) part in <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant melanoma pts. In ESC, five dose levels were explored: LXH254 200 mg twice daily (BID) + TMT (1 mg or 0.5 mg) daily (QD); LXH254 400 mg BID + TMT (1 mg or 0.5 mg) QD; LXH254 400 mg BID + TMT 1 mg (QD, 2 wk on\/2 wk off). Primary objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability, and determine the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Secondary objectives were to characterize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LXH254 + TMT, and evaluate antitumor activity.<br \/>Results: As of Dec 9, 2021, 36 and 30 pts were enrolled in ESC and EXP, respectively; median age was 63.5 and 69 y, respectively. Pts in ESC and EXP received a median of 3 (range: 1-6) and 2 (range: 1-7) prior treatments, respectively, including IO (ESC: 88.9% pts; EXP: 96.7% pts). All pts from ESC and 24 pts from EXP discontinued, mainly due to progressive disease (61.1% and 60%, respectively); 6 pts were ongoing in EXP at data cut-off. In ESC, Grade &#8805;3 (G&#8805;3) DLTs were reported in 6 pts: dermatitis acneiform (n=2), maculopapular rash (n=2), increased lipase (n=1), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (n=1). The RDEs were LXH254 200 mg BID + TMT 1 mg QD and LXH254 400 mg BID + TMT 0.5 mg QD. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 34 pts (94.4%) in ESC and all pts in EXP. G&#8805;3 TRAEs in ESC and EXP were experienced by 19 (52.8%) and 24 (80%) pts, respectively; the most common being rash or dermatitis acneiform (13.9% each) in ESC and rash (33.3%) in EXP. One fatal TRAE (hypovolemic shock) was reported in the LXH254 400 mg BID + TMT 0.5 mg QD group. The ORR in EXP was 46.7% (7 pts; 95% CI: 21.3-73.4) for LXH254 200 mg BID + TMT 1 mg QD and 13.3% (2 pts; 95% CI: 1.7-40.5) for LXH254 400 mg BID + TMT 0.5 mg QD; overall in EXP, 9 pts (30%) achieved PR and 13 pts (43.3%) reported SD. In EXP the median DOR was 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.6-7.4). Exposures of LXH254 (200 mg or 400 mg BID) + TMT (0.5 mg or 1 mg QD) vs LXH254 single agent were comparable, indicating no apparent LXH254-TMT interactions. Limited paired tumor biopsy data (n=8) showed substantial MAPK pathway inhibition (DUSP6).<br \/>Conclusions: LXH254 in combination with TMT has shown preliminary antitumor activity in the pretreated, <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant melanoma population. A Phase II trial of LXH254 combinations in pts with pretreated <i>BRAF<\/i>- or <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant melanoma is currently ongoing (NCT04417621).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a8ea3fa-c8f4-4eab-a2e2-c7a745b11772\/@z03B8ZYf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,LXH254,Phase Ib,NRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20215"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"8fa31079-5ff4-4805-b3bc-1d8b66dbf409","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8fa31079-5ff4-4805-b3bc-1d8b66dbf409\/@z03B8ZYf\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Filippo De Braud<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Dooms<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca S.

First-dose intravenous (IV) delivery leads to infusion-related reactions (IRR) among 66% of patients, resulting in dose interruptions and slower infusion restart rates (infusion duration ranges 2-4 hours) and necessitates splitting of the dose over 2 days (Park <i>Ann Oncol<\/i> 32[suppl_5]:S981). Subcutaneous (SC) administration of amivantamab, which could simplify and accelerate administration, is being investigated in an ongoing phase 1 study (PALOMA; NCT04606381). Preliminary safety (including IRR) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SC formulations of amivantamab &#177; recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) for enhanced absorption were evaluated.<br \/>Methods: PALOMA is an ongoing phase 1 dose escalation study of amivantamab SC in patients with advanced solid tumors who may derive benefit from EGFR or MET-directed therapy. Eligible patients must have progressed after standard-of-care therapy for metastatic disease, be ineligible for, or have declined current standard therapies. The study objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of administration, safety, and PK of a low concentration formulation, 50 mg\/mL of amivantamab &#177; rHuPH20 (Part 1) and a high concentration formulation, 160 mg\/mL of amivantamab &#177; rHuPH20 (Part 2). Patients in Part 1 and Part 2 received the currently approved dosage of amivantamab, 1050 mg (1400 mg for bodyweight &#8805;80 kg) SC (weekly for the first 4 weeks and every other week thereafter). This study also evaluated administering the full dose of amivantamab on the first day.<br \/>Results: The full safety, PK, bioavailability, and receptor occupancy data of patients enrolled in Part 1 (n=16) and Part 2 (n=17) will be presented. Compared to IV administration, initial SC experience demonstrates the co&#8209;formulation of high concentration amivantamab with rHuPH20 shortened the needed infusion time to less than 5 minutes, with initial bioavailability of approximately 65% of IV administration. Saturation of soluble free EGFR and MET was achieved after the first SC dose. The incidence of IRRs was 18.2%, with all events of grade 1-2 severity. The full amivantamab SC dose was safely given at first administration to 14 patients, potentially obviating the need for split dosing.<br \/>Conclusions: Initial SC amivantamab &#177; rHuPH20 was well tolerated with improvements in time and ease of administration and associated with a meaningful reduction in IRRs, eliminating the need for split dosing compared with IV administration. Higher SC dose levels and alternative dosing schedules are being explored.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd93b045-8f59-46e9-9696-560349c01835\/@z03B8ZYf\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL01-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Amivantamab,Subcutaneous,Bispecific antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21368"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Matthew G.
