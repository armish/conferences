[{"Abstract":"Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) constitute the largest number of cancers diagnosed in the United States, with an estimated 1 in 5 people affected by the age of 70. The most notable NMSCs are squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), which are considered keratinocyte cancers due to their origin. Although the majority of NMSCs can be removed with surgery or curettage, these options are not always available if the tumor occurs in an inoperable location or becomes metastatic. While non-surgical treatment modalities are also currently available, they have not been fully effective in NMSC management. Therefore, novel mechanistic-based therapeutic strategies are needed. The polo-like kinases (PLKs) are a family of serine\/threonine kinases that have been found to play multiple roles in regulating the cell cycle. PLK4 is a structurally unique member of this family, which has been shown to be essential for precise centriole duplication. However, PLK4 has been shown to be dysregulated in certain cancers. Though the role of PLK4 in NMSC is not fully understood, we previously showed that PLK4 was significantly overexpressed in NMSC cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels as compared to normal keratinocytes, and its small molecule inhibition resulted in anti-proliferative responses in NMSC cell lines (Cancer Res 2018; 78 [13 Suppl]: Abstract nr 547). Here, we further validated our previous observation by determining the effects of CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) of PLK4 in the A431 human SCC line, both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our data demonstrated significantly reduced cell growth of multiple A431 PLK4 KO clones compared to wild-type (WT) cells, as measured by RealTime-Glo MT cell viability and trypan blue exclusion assays. In addition, we found significant reduction in clonogenic survival of A431 PLK4 KO cells, as measured by colony formation assays. Using a Human Cancer Pathway Finder RT2 Profiler PCR array, we identified 18 of the 84 genes tested to be greater than 1.6-fold differentially regulated after PLK4 KO in these cells. Employing Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, we identified that the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by growth factors was one of the top canonical pathways modulated by PLK4 KO. To determine the <i>in vivo<\/i> relevance of our <i>in vitro<\/i> data, we compared the tumorigenicity of the A431 WT and PLK4 KO cells in nu\/nu mice. The mice (n=7 per group) were injected subcutaneously with 5 x 10<sup>5<\/sup> A431 WT or PLK4 KO cells and tumors were allowed to grow for further analyses. We found a significant reduction in tumor volume in A431 PLK4 KO xenografts as compared to A431 PLK4 WT xenografts. Taken together, these findings support our previous results that suggest PLK4 has pro-proliferative roles in NMSC and should be further studied as a potential novel target for skin cancer management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3450d27c-0398-4dfc-b9a1-0b07f6404a13\/@x03B8ZEF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carcinoma: squamous cell,PLK4,Nude mice,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12923"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mary A.

Current treatment for Ewing sarcoma includes a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and local control with radiation and\/or surgery. The survival rate of those with Ewing sarcoma has seen very little improvement over the past several decades and remains dismal for those with recurrent or metastatic disease. The purpose of this study is to identify novel agents currently available for use in Ewing sarcoma.<br \/>Methods: Novel targeted approaches for the treatment of ES were identified using RNA sequencing performed on 15 ES patient derived cell lines with bioinformatic analysis of gene expression. Targeted agents were tested on patient cell lines at escalating doses. At 48 hours cell viability was assessed with CellTiter-Glo 2.0 and analyzed with GraphPad Prism to determine the IC50. At 24- and 48-hours western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the effect on cell cycle and apoptosis. Combination studies with standard chemotherapy were performed to evaluate for synergy using SynergyFinder 2.0.<br \/>Results: RNA analysis identified HDAC2, ALK and JAK1 as a potential therapeutic targets. The pan-HDAC inhibitor, Panobinostat, was cytotoxic to all Ewing sarcoma cell lines tested with clinically relevant IC50s (&#8804;200nM) and repressed expression of Cyclin D1 and pRB. ALK inhibition was cytotoxic at doses slightly higher than that of clinical relevance. HDAC and ALK expression levels correlated to cell sensitivity. JAK1 inhibition does not appear to have efficacy at clinically relevant dosing. Panobinostat synergizes with Doxorubicin at clinically relevant doses.<br \/>Conclusion: This work highlights that RNA expression may identify potential targets which could be effective in treating Ewing sarcoma or potentially improve the efficacy of standard of care drugs. HDAC and ALK inhibition show a decrease in cell viability in ES cell line models. Future studies of HDAC and ALK inhibitors will aim to determine efficacy in xenograft models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/875fecdb-f746-451f-9ee7-30fe46a78212\/@y03B8ZEG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Drug sensitivity,Drug synergy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12924"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kaitlyn Smith<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Divya Gandra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly McKinney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karl Dykema<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhinav Nagulapally<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giselle S.

Signaling receptors, adhesion molecules, and surface antigens that drive lung cancer progression are regulated by N-glycosylation, a post-translational protein modification initiated in the ER. Strategies for inhibition of N-glycosylation have recently been refined through the discovery of small molecules that partially disrupt glycan transfer. Here we screened for the target of a novel small molecule that reduces protein glycosylation with the goal of identifying new therapeutic targets for lung cancer.<br \/>METHODS: Pooled results from chemical library HTS efforts identified hit compounds with activity. Counter-screening was performed in A549 cells using a fluorescence-based reporter (Halo1N) that detects aberrant N-glycosylation. The cellular targets for one class of inhibitors were evaluated by combining a whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screen with FACS sorting for loss of pharmacologic function. Significant changes in gRNA between populations was determined by MAGeCK analysis. The interaction between a compound and its target was determined by CETSA, and mechanism of action was verified by gene knockout and rescue experiments. Glycosylation status of glycoproteins were measured by western blot and cell compartment fluorescence. Predicted compound binding sites on the protein were mutated using site-directed mutagenesis.<br \/>RESULTS: The lead tool compound (CP-9) has an IC50 in uM range and was used as a probe for target identification. CP-9 activates Halo-1N fluorescence, and whole genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening was used to identify gRNAs associated with loss of CP-9 activity. MAGeCK analysis demonstrated significant enrichment of genes associated with the translocon and ribosome (FDR <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01) in the non-fluorescent population. We tested components of the signal recognition particle-receptor complex for direct interactions using the CETSA and demonstrate CP-9 binding to SR-&#946; but not SR-&#945;. Knockout experiments confirm that inhibition of glycosylation by CP-9 is dependent on SR-&#946; expression, and CP-9&#8217;s effect on glycosylation and was rescued by SR-&#946; re-expression. Mutated SR-&#946; diminished CP-9&#8217;s effects on glycosylation and reduced SR-&#946; thermal stabilization. CP-9 disrupted an interaction between SR-&#946;\/SR-&#945; and the ribosome-translocon-OST complex suggesting a mechanism of action. Interestingly, a transmembrane domain mutant (&#916;TM) of SR-&#946; reduced the CP-9 effect and glycoprotein expression. &#916;TM-SR-&#946; also significantly reduced cell proliferation in A459 lung adenocarcinoma cells.<br \/>CONCLUSION: CP-9 partially inhibits N-glycosylation by interfering with SR-&#946;\/SR-&#945; and the translocon complex, leading to the disruption of protein import and glycosylation in the ER. Transmembrane domain mutants of SR-&#946; reduce lung cancer cell growth and suggest this protein as a potential target for lung cancer drug development in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ddec5dd-8ece-4c3e-acce-7648f8e39852\/@y03B8ZEG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,CRISPR\/Cas9,Glycosylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12925"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chatchai Phoomak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph N.

Although it has been shown to enhance the potency of arsenic trioxide in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells and to induce cytotoxicity in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell lines, its molecular mechanism of action is mostly unknown. We investigated a novel mode of action of CDDP through modulation of stress signals, disruption of MDM2-DAXX-HAUSP complex, and activation of p53 in APL cell lines. We found that CDDP-induced stress signals were transmitted and reduced expression of complex molecules and also effected their association leading to p53 activation. CDDP-activated p53 led to cell cycle arrest and induced both early and late apoptosis in APL cells. Our findings also showed that CDDP stimulated more promyelocytes formation with dense granules, activated p53 expression, and reduced expression of MDM2 in both APL mice bone marrow cells and liver tissues. This novel mechanism of action of CDDP in APL cells may help in the design of new anti-leukemic drugs for treatment of APL patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5bdb3bb4-d3d1-47e0-a3b2-9e6d72501064\/@y03B8ZEG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cisplatin,p53,MDM2,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12926"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul B.

Moreover, SerpinA6 has been reported to participate in stress response by releasing cortisol specifically at inflammatory sites upon cleavage by human neutrophil elastase between residues 344 and 345. In castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients, reports suggest castration induces inflammation in the prostate, which increases glucocorticoids (GCs) levels and elevates pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels. We propose declining SerpinA6 levels in the prostate may play a role in prostate cancer disease progression. This could be due to increasing IL-6 levels after castration, which may inhibit or degrade SerpinA6. Deficient SerpinA6 may not be sufficient to keep steroids inactive, due to the increasing GCs.<b> <\/b>Our data suggests IL-6 treatment of androgen independent prostate cancer (PC-3) cells decreases SerpinA6 level and conversely increases glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in a dose (1-10ng\/ml) and time (30-180 minutes) dependent fashion. Moreover, IL-6 dose dependent treatment in PC-3 cells decreases FOXO3a expression, a major apoptotic protein dysregulated in prostate cancer. Next, we determine the role of SerpinA6 (30&#181;g\/ml) and IL-6(5ng\/ml) independently and in combination to PC-3 cells. We observed IL-6 and SerpinA6 co-treatment to PC-3 cells (charcoal stripped FBS media) for 6 hours reduced Neutrophil elastase levels significantly.<b> <\/b>Additionally we observed increased FOXO3a and SerpinA6 expression, whereas decreased GR and HNF3&#945; levels. However,<b> <\/b>silencing IL-6 in PC-3 cells increased SerpinA6 expression. To further support our findings, silencing SerpinA6 in metastatic variant of PC-3 cells increased phosphor-Akt-(ser-473), glucocorticoid receptor and increased apoptotic protein FOXO3a expressions. Using dexamethasone (15&#181;M), which is known to suppress PC-3 cell migration, we found increased expression of SerpinA6. Conversely, Mifepristone (15&#181;M), which inhibits PC-3 cell growth, deceases SerpinA6 expression after 24 hours of treatment. In humans the normal range of circulatory SerpinA6 level are 19-45ug\/ml. We treated normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE1) and prostate cancer (PC-3) cells with human recombinant protein 18 and 36ug\/ml of doses for 24 hours; RWPE1 cells represented a SerpinA6 dose dependent increase in cellular viability, whereas PC-3 cells demonstrated no change in the viability after a dose response treatment with SerpinA6 for 24 hours. These findings suggest the SerpinA6 context dependent role. We suggest that decreasing levels of SerpinA6 and FOXO3a expressions in the prostate cancer patients may have potential role in disease progression. Moreover, we need to have an effective agent, which could prevent the decreasing levels of SerpinA6 and FOXO3a in prostate to inhibit the progression of prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7e1c92c1-9e29-4948-b8d1-78f22ce33b64\/@y03B8ZEG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate,Cancer marker,Signaling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12927"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Carlos Riveros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Chalfant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jatinder Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sanjeev Shukla<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Clinically, GATA3 loss defines a subset of patients with poor response to hormonal therapy and poor prognosis. As a transcription factor, however, GATA3 is not pharmacologically targetable.

Many potential therapies have been suggested and tested - including appetite stimulants, targeted cytokine blockers, and nutritional supplementation, but effective therapies have still not found a place in the clinic. Thus, a new approach to treating cancer cachexia is warranted. Members of the Kruppel-like factor family play wide-ranging and important roles in the development, maintenance, and metabolism of muscle. Upon review both our own and multiple publically available datasets, we identified KLF10 upregulation in a multitude of cachectic muscles - including in pancreatic, lung, and colon cancer mouse models and in human cachexia patients. Thus, in this study, we interrogated loss-of-function of KLF10 in the context of pancreatic cancer associated muscle wasting. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> experiments on satellite cells isolated from KLF10 Knockout (KO) mice showed resistance to the effect of KPC conditioned media on atrophy. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies using a KLF10 KO mouse model showed that upon orthotopic implantation of T4-KPC cells, the mice demonstrated a significant preservation of lean mass and significant alterations in the expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases Trim63 and Fbxo32, as well as other genes implicated in atrophy, calcium signaling, and autophagy. Pathway analysis of RNA-seq data from these mice identified TGF-B, a known inducer of KLF10, as an important upstream regulator of the response. Further <i>in vivo<\/i> experimentation showed KLF10 KO mice to be resistant to the atrophic effects of TGF-B injections. In conclusion, we report a novel role of KLF10 in the manifestation of cachexia in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/02119923-6258-41fc-b85c-8aa3350c34ea\/@y03B8ZEG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,TGF-&#946;,Pancreatic cancer,Knockout mice,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12929"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel F.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies. Estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) levels are high in about 60-70% of TNBCs. Recent reports including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) show that about 80% of TNBC express mutant p53 and it is the most predominant driver in these cancers. We have previously reported (<i>JNCI<\/i>, 2019, 111:1202-1215) that ER-beta binds p53 and exerts proliferative versus anti-proliferative\/tumor suppressive functions depending on the wild type and mutant p53 status in TNBC, respectively. In the current work we used multiple approaches such as immunoprecipitation, in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA), and gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to show that tamoxifen (Tam) increases ER beta-p53 interaction resulting in decrease of mutant p53 binding to p73 leading to cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation, and increased expression of anti-proliferation genes. Importantly, ER beta antagonist PHTPP decreases the ER beta-p53 interaction in TNBC cells, whereas ER beta agonist DPN did not have any effect. Importantly, Tam synergized with doxorubicin (Dox) to decrease the IC50 of Dox more than 3-fold. This synergism was absent in an isogenic cell line where <i>TP53<\/i> gene was knocked out. The fact that mutant p53 expression was necessary for Tam to synergize with Dox, along with our observation that upregulation of anti-proliferation gene expression was dependent on both ER beta and p73, strongly suggests that ER beta-mutant p53-p73 axis is the target of the novel effect of Tam. RNA-seq and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis of isogenic TNBC cells differing in p53 mutational status without and with ER beta depletion revealed important cellular pathways impacted by the synergistic effect of Tam plus Dox combination treatment. To test the effect of Tam plus Dox combination therapy in vivo, we used isogenic MDA-MB-231 cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. Consistent with our observations in the TNBC cell models, combination therapy inhibited progression of both CDX and PDX tumors more effectively compared to monotherapies. Furthermore, the antitumor effect was dependent on expression of mutant p53 in tumors. Our study has revealed a novel ER beta-mutant p53-p73 axis that could be targeted by Tam in combination with chemotherapy, raising the possibility of repurposing Tam to treat molecularly stratified TNBC that expresses both ER&#946; and mutant p53. Besides the potential for relatively faster entry of a safe and less expensive therapy to the clinic, our discovery can be exploited to reduce toxic adverse effects by reducing the dose of Dox in treatment regimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9f0ce97d-fe7c-4e24-b7c2-2198bce54c0d\/@y03B8ZEG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Drug synergy,Estrogen receptor &#946;,p53 mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12931"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gokul M.

We have previously shown that the brain penetrant class 1 HDAC inhibitor RG2833 (RGFP109) inhibits cell growth (MTS assay for HSJD007 p=0.0004, JHH-DIPG1 p=0.001, SF-7761 p=0.04, SU-DIPG13 p=0.01 by <i>t-test<\/i>), reduces proliferation (phospho-Rb Western blot, BrdU immunofluorescence HSJD007 p=0.008, JHH-DIPG1 p=0.0002 by <i>t-test<\/i>), and induces apoptosis (cPARP Western blot, cleaved caspase 3 immunofluorescence HSJD007 p&#60;0.003, JHH-DIPG1 p=0.0026 by <i>t-test<\/i>) in multiple DIPG cell lines. We have also shown that treatment of a DIPG flank tumor mouse model with RG2833 alone for 1 week suppresses flank tumor growth (p&#60; 0.005 by <i>t-test<\/i>) and induces apoptosis (Western blot for cPARP). In a DIPG orthotopic mouse model, we confirmed that RG2833 100mg\/kg has on target activity in the mouse brain (Western blot for histone 3 acetylation) without causing toxicity. We next sought to identify a rational combination therapy to enhance RG2833 efficacy against DIPG. We found that RG2833 increases expression of negative cell cycle regulators p16, p21, and p27 and decreases expression of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-XL, and XIAP (assessed by Western blot). Given that PI3K\/mTOR pathway is upregulated in DIPG and plays an important role in cell cycle regulation via p21 and the FOXO signaling, we hypothesized that RG2833 would synergize with inhibitors of PI3K\/mTOR. The brain penetrant PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor Paxalisib is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial of children with DIPG. We found that RG2833 has strong synergism with Paxalisib at clinically achievable doses (Loewe synergy scores by SynergyFinder for SF7761 and JHH-DIPG1 &#62;20).

HER4 is activated through ligand binding, transmitting intracellular signals by homodimerizing, or by heterodimerizing with other family members (EGFR, HER2, HER3). The role of HER4 in cancer or normal tissue has not been studied as comprehensively as EGFR and HER2, potentially due to a more complex biology that includes four different isoforms and different stability\/tissue-specific expression patterns, and oncogenic or oncosuppressor roles. The oral, irreversible pan-HER (EGFR, HER2, HER4) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) neratinib (NER) is clinically active against HER2-mutant and HER2-amplified cancers. Using publicly available datasets including cBioPortal and COSMIC and predicted structural and functional impacts, this study aimed to identify HER4 mutations with the greatest oncogenic potential that may have value as potential biomarkers of response to NER.<br \/>Methods: The frequency of HER4 mutations across 33 cancer types was determined by using the clinical database cBioPortal and TCGA PanCancer Atlas datasets (n=10967). A shortlist of potentially oncogenic HER4 mutations was created based on the occurrence in cBioPortal and COSMIC databases, annotation as putative driver and cancer hotspot, structural and functional impacts according to OncoKB, Mutation Assessor, SIFT and Polyphen-2 software, and HER4 protein folding studies. Analysis was carried out using the R-studio statistical environment.<br \/>Results: HER4 amplification is rare in cancer, with the majority of genetic changes reported as point mutations; particularly missense (31.93%), synonymous (6.43%) and nonsense (3%) substitutions. Melanoma and esophagogastric (EG) cancers showed the highest HER4 alteration frequency, 17.34% and 13.42%, respectively, across different cancer types in the cBioPortal database. Melanoma and EG cancers showed the second and third highest absolute count of HER4 genomic alterations (n=77 and n=69, respectively). Based on the criteria outlined in methods, a priority list of HER4 mutations with greatest oncogenic potential was curated for melanoma (HER4 R106C, R306C, R711C, G936E, F1003I), stomach (HER4 C217R, S774N, K1002R, Y1150C) and esophageal (HER4 R488W, S449Y) adenocarcinomas. Mutations at these sites, located across ligand-binding, dimerization and intracellular signaling domains, have the potential to impact HER4 activity and thus possibly act as biomarkers of response to an irreversible pan-HER TKI like NER.<br \/>Conclusions: These data suggest that melanoma and EG cancers are the cancer types with the highest rate of HER4 mutations. In vitro functional characterization of the identified HER4 mutations is now required to further explore their value as biomarkers of response to NER.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e0458231-8e54-43b8-8f95-3ca6b5704261\/@z03B8ZEH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Esophageal cancer,ErbB,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12934"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"843baf51-87fe-4dba-b442-a9e5c5db8454","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/843baf51-87fe-4dba-b442-a9e5c5db8454\/@z03B8ZEH\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marta Valenti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil T.

The incidence and mortality associated to lung cancer is a major challenge of the Public Health Policy in advanced societies. Although the great effort has been done in NSCLC therapeutic strategies, there are still many NSCLC patients who cannot benefit either from molecular targeted or immune related therapies. Here, we identified DSTYK, a dual serine\/threonine and tyrosine non-receptor protein kinase, as a novel candidate with a crucial role in NSCLC. According to data obtained from the TCGA, genomic alterations (mainly copy number alterations and mutations) of DSTYK are present in 40% of lung cancer patients, from which 4.7% LUAD and 3.4% LUSC correspond to copy number (CN) amplification (more than 3 genomic copies). Besides, DSTYK amplification is found to be a poor prognostic factor in lung cancer patients. Accordingly, high expression of DSTYK predicted both, a lower overall survival (OS) and poorer progression free survival (PFS). We next depleted DSTYK expression in both murine and human NSCLC cell lines. DSTYK abrogation prevented cytoprotective autophagy via mTOR regulation, accumulating LC3 and p-P62. In addition, DSTYK inhibition impaired lysosomal biogenesis and maturation, which contributed to dysfunctional autophagy. Furthermore, DSTYK depleted cells showed increased ROS levels caused by depolarized and damaged mitochondria. All together, these results demonstrate that knockdown of DSTYK promoted a dramatic reduction of mitophagy.As it has been shown that autophagy in cancer cells can limit antitumor immunity, we evaluated the role of immune-mediated tumor cell killing in an altered DSTYK context. We found that inhibition of DSTYK sensitized lung cancer cells to T cell&#8211;mediated cytotoxicity, via TNF-&#593;. More importantly, immunocompetent mouse models transplanted with DSTYK-inhibited tumors were sensitized to &#593;nti-PD1 treatment.Finally, in a cohort of NSCLC patients that underwent immunotherapy (n=40), DSTYK amplification predicted resistance to the treatment, showing poorer PFS rates. The time to progression for DSTYK amplified patients was on average, around 50% faster than that for non-DSTYK altered patients, diminishing from 232 to 114 months.In conclusion, our results support that DSTYK is a new target and that its inhibition could be the base of new therapies, which could benefit a subgroup of NSCLC patients showing genetic amplification, both at early (adjuvant) or late (single or combined treatment) stages of the disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ce4dd3c9-22e6-4f77-bcba-b2055afcdb5d\/@z03B8ZEH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Autophagy,Immunotherapy,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12935"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Karmele Valencia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mirari Echepare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Pasquier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alvaro Teijeira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina Bertolo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina Sainz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Graziella Bosco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roman K.

In addition, current treatments rely on multi-modal therapy that has significant short- and long-term side effects. New, less toxic and more effective treatments are urgently needed. One potential therapeutic target is the receptor tyrosine kinase MERTK. MERTK is overexpressed in numerous cancers where it promotes tumor cell survival, metastasis, and resistance to cytotoxic and targeted therapies. We demonstrated expression and phosphorylation of MERTK protein in 5 of 5 EWS family cell lines tested. Stimulation with the MERTK ligand GAS6 resulted in activation of downstream oncogenic signaling pathways, including JAK\/STAT and MAPK\/ERK. Moreover, publicly available data from CRISPR-based library screens suggest that EWS cell lines are particularly dependent on MERTK. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting MERTK may be particularly effective for treatment of EWS. To explore the therapeutic impact of MERTK inhibition in various cancers, we developed MRX-2843, a first-in-class MERTK-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently in clinical trials. Treatment with MRX-2843 decreased phosphorylation of MERTK in a dose dependent manner, with an IC50 of 123 nM (95% CI; 53-180 nM) in A673 cells, and reduced downstream STAT6 signaling. In addition, MRX-2843 had potent anti-tumor activity against all 5 EWS cell lines, leading to reduced expansion and decreased cell density in culture with IC50 values ranging from 178 - 297 nM. Of note, inhibition of MERTK phosphorylation correlated with anti-tumor activity in both the A673 and TC106 cell lines, implicating MERTK inhibition as a mechanism of MRX-2843 anti-tumor activity. Together these data validate MERTK as a promising therapeutic target in EWS and support development of MRX-2843 for treatment of EWS, with potential to directly inform and enable a clinical trial in pediatric patients and, ultimately, to improve both outcomes and quality of life for patients with this disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/73d85866-8d91-4600-9417-16be1c28bcd2\/@z03B8ZEH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Molecular targets,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12936"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sherri K.

In contrast, mounting evidence indicates that people with Down Syndrome have lower rates of numerous solid tumors, particularly carcinogen driven cancers, even when adjusted for age. The mechanisms that dictate why this occurs are not well understood but could potentially yield actionable targets for treating or preventing cancer formation. We hypothesized Ts65Dn mice, a murine model of Down Syndrome, would be protected against BCa formation and could be evaluated as a genetic basis for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets in bladder cancer. Using the well characterized N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) chemical carcinogen bladder cancer model we initiated tumors in Ts65Dn and WT mice. After 16 weeks BBN exposure, TS65Dn mice were found to have smaller bladder tumors by weight with a trend toward lower stages as compared to WT animals. RNA-sequencing was used to assess broad genomic changes in the tumors. Reactome analysis of the RNA-sequencing data indicated pathways associated with mitosis and the cell cycle were most affected in Ts65Dn mice, including downregulation of pathways associated with Aurora Kinase B (AURKB). AURKB is a pro-tumorigenic kinase known to enhance cell survival and proliferation. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that while AURKB is broadly expressed in most tissues, it is potently upregulated in bladder cancers, offering a potential therapeutic target. Using the AURKB specific inhibitor barasertib-HQPA we evaluated drug sensitivity in a set of BCa cell lines. Cell lines associated with a basal subtype gene signature (5637, HT-1376) were largely susceptible to barasertib with IC50 values in nM concentrations, whereas other BCa cell lines (HTB-5, T24) had IC50 values nearly 1,000X higher. We next assessed histone H3 phosphorylation, a known substrate of AURKB, to validate drug efficacy. Interestingly, inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation was noted in all cell lines at nM concentrations, indicating that while barasertib is functionally active in both sets of cells, the anti-proliferative activity is not dependent upon phosphorylation of histone H3, but rather other factors that we have yet to determine. In conclusion, we have found Ts65Dn mice have reduced tumor formation when exposed to the BCa carcinogen BBN and furthermore, have identified AURKB as a potential therapeutic target. Use of Ts65Dn mice may be a relevant model for identifying potentially undefined tumorigenic agents in multiple cancers including bladder.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/673adcd1-16b2-4b7e-8ee3-339029aa5080\/@z03B8ZEH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Drug discovery,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12937"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Binh Vo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erika Abbott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolyn J.

Although high-throughput Identification of SNVs can be achieved with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, the cost is significant, and proportional to the desired sensitivity of variant detection. Conversely, while only small numbers of SNVs can be queried in an individual quantitative PCR (qPCR) or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) reaction, a fully optimized qPCR or ddPCR assay can detect SNVs at very low frequencies for a fraction of the cost of sequencing. Herein, we present a generalizable approach to PCR assay design, using a combination of mutation-sensitive induced mismatch primers, wild-type suppressors, and TaqMan probes, that permits detection of SNVs below 0.1%.<br \/>Method: Known oncogenic hotspot regions were selected for development of mutation-detecting PCR assays. For each hotspot, a mutation-specific-mismatch primer, suppressor, and probe (MSMPSP) cassette was designed consisting of 1) a mutation-bearing forward primer with engineered mismatches, 2) a wild-type, extension-locked blocker oligo, 3) a fluorescent TaqMan probe, and 4) a downstream reverse primer. Designed mutation assays were evaluated using plasmid control sequences, remnant clinical specimens, and healthy donor peripheral blood samples spiked with known quantities of mutation-bearing plasmid or cell lines and processed on the BioRad AutoDG\/QX200 droplet digital PCR system.<br \/>Results: Variant detection below 0.1% was achieved for all tested mutations, including those residing in homopolymeric and GC-rich regions, from as low as 100 ng DNA input, in a single day. At higher variant frequencies accessible to multiple platforms, results with MSMPSP-based ddPCR assays exhibited excellent concordance with NGS and qPCR results and yielded linear signal decline down to 0.01% variant allele frequency. Overall assay sensitivity was proportional to DNA input, and improved detection limits were achieved by increased DNA input and combined well analysis.<br \/>Conclusion: Utilizing the MSMPSP approach, coupled with ddPCR, variant detection for targeted mutations below 0.1% is achievable in diverse genomic contexts. Furthermore, simple design principles and flexible probe-binding sites permit rapid development of new assays, allowing critical mutations to be tracked as they are discovered. While multiplexing capabilities are reduced compared with NGS, short time-to-results, coupled with low cost-per-sample for MSMPSP ddPCR, permits faster treatment decisions at reduced cost to the healthcare system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/66bf8de0-6b4c-4024-95f7-de64cf064a31\/@z03B8ZEH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Droplet digital PCR,Mutation detection,Molecular markers,DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12938"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sarah Heine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Beams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Nathan Riccitelli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shabnam Tangri<\/i><\/presenter>.

The molecular interactions between ERO1&#945; and PDI allow for proper protein folding to occur. Recent reports indicate that ERO1&#945; expression is a poor prognostic indicator of survival in multiple cancer types including multiple myeloma, lung cancer, esophageal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In this study we utilized genetic strategies to determine the role of ERO1&#945; in EGFR driven Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Our data indicate that CRISPR knockout of ERO1&#945; leads to decreased clonogenicity in both PC-9 and HCC4006 cell lines. The phenotype can be partially rescued upon addition of conditioned media derived from the control cell lines. The data suggest that ERO1&#945; expression is required for correct protein folding of a secreted factor that contributes to clonogenicity and growth. PC-9 ERO1&#945; knockout cells injected into SCID-Beige animals led to increased overall survival (OS) compared to animals injected with PC-9 control cells. (PC-9 Control OS = 100 days, PC-9 ERO1&#945; Knockout OS =154 days p=0.0045 **). Interestingly, ERO1&#945; knockout cell lines still maintained sensitivity to standard of care agent Osimertinib. We identified T151742 as an ERO1&#945; inhibitor that was approximately 2-fold more potent compared to the previously published ERO1&#945; inhibitor EN460. A cellular thermal shift assay was performed to determine specificity of T151742 toward ERO1&#945; compared to other FAD containing enzymes. We show that T151742 had a higher specificity towards ERO1&#945; in comparison to other flavoenzymes such as ERO1&#946; and LSD-1. Finally, our data indicate that PC-9 ERO1&#945; knockout cell lines were ~2-fold resistant to T151742 by MTT but were completely resistant when using a 3D cell culture model suggesting T151742 is reliant on ERO1&#945; in a 3D system. Finally, treatment of PC9 and HCC4006 cells with T151742 in combination with Osimertinib was synergistic in vitro. Taken together, this suggests ERO1&#945; may be a viable target for EGFR driven NSCLC and that future studies will elucidate the use of T157142 in vivo as a single agent and in combination with EGFR inhibitors using <i>in vivo<\/i> studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d15ccc20-bfbb-4d1c-b8fd-6b4630ebc902\/@z03B8ZEH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer markers,Target discovery,Biomarkers,Adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12939"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brennan D.

Despite decades of research, systemic therapy options have remained essentially unchanged. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches to treat osteosarcoma are of great need for this patient population. We have performed high throughput screening to identify NGI-1, a first in class small molecule inhibitor that targets oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), disrupts protein glycosylation, and has significant activity in osteosarcoma cell lines. We have examined the mechanism of osteosarcoma sensitivity with the goal of developing a new therapeutic approach.<br \/>Methods: A drug screen of 519 solid tumor cell lines was performed to identify sensitivity to NGI-1 treatment. The screening results were validated through measurement of relative changes in proliferation of nine different osteosarcoma cell lines using MTT assay. To identify the pathways involved in osteosarcoma sensitivity to OST inhibition, a CRISPR-Cas9 kinome knockout library screen targeting 750 human kinases and related genes was performed in the HUO-3N1 cell line. Drug combination (OST+PERK\/IRE1 inhibitor) studies were performed using MTT assay to validate the CRISPR screen targets, where the drug combination synergy quantification was determined using COMPUSYN software. Outcomes of inhibitor treatment were analyzed using western blot and PCR assay.<br \/>Results: A drug sensitivity screen of solid tumor cell lines was performed with a nine-point NGI-1 serial dilution and analyzed for cell viability. The results show that tumor cell lines derived from bone tissue origins, comprised of osteosarcomas and Ewing&#8217;s sarcomas, have high sensitivity to NGI-1 treatment. MTT assays performed with nine different osteosarcoma cell lines validated the results from the screen showing different sensitivity of the NGI-1treatment. To identify mechanisms of sensitivity, CRISPR-Cas9 kinome gRNA library screen was used in the HUO-3N1 cell line treated with NGI-1 vs control for 21 days. The results from the screen analyses showed the negative enrichment of gRNAs targeting EIF2AK3 (PERK; p=0.0000004) and ERN1(IRE1; p=0.0006) revealing roles in mediating NGI-1 sensitivity. The effect of pharmacologic inhibitors for PERK(GSK26006414) and IRE1 (4&#956;8C) on the cell growth (HUO-3N1 and G-292) validated the screening results. The combination of NGI-1with either the PERK or IRE1 inhibitor showed synergistic effects on the inhibition of osteosarcoma cell growth concurrent with enhanced induction of BiP and XBP1s, major effectors of the ER stress pathway.<br \/>Conclusion: This study shows ER stress as one of the major pathways regulating the osteosarcoma sensitivity to OST inhibition. Ongoing studies are testing OST inhibition and other mechanisms of ER stress activation as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osteosarcomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b1c7a0c1-876c-4022-8198-33b6adfa7e7b\/@z03B8ZEH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Osteosarcoma,Oligosaccharyltransferase,ER Stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12940"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aanchal Katoch<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Contessa<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cachexia worsens cancer patient prognoses and contributes to poor chemotherapy tolerance and response rates. About 80% of pancreatic cancer patients suffer from cachexia and one-third die due to cachexia-related complications such as respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Although there has been considerable research into cachexia mechanisms and interventions, there are, to date, no FDA-approved cachexia therapies. A major contributing factor could be the failure of animal models to accurately recapitulate the human condition. In this study, we generated an aged murine model of pancreatic cancer cachexia to compare cachexia progression in young versus aged tumor-bearing mice. Comparative transcriptomic analyses of the muscles identified 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a known autophagy inhibitor, as a candidate anti-wasting compound. In vitro<\/i> analyses confirmed anti-wasting effects while in vivo<\/i> analysis demonstrated that 3-MA could rescue muscle wasting and suppress tumor growth. Surprisingly, transcriptome analyses of 3MA-treated tumor cells did not reveal autophagy-related signatures but instead implicated Perp<\/i> as a novel 3-MA target. Probing further, we 1) observed significantly higher expression of Perp in pancreatic cancer cell lines compared to control cells, 2) noted a survival disadvantage associated with elevated PERP in the TCGA database, 3) found that PERP knockdown in cancer cells led to reduced tumor proliferation, and 4) confirmed that 3-MA-associated Perp reduction inhibited tumor growth. Moreover, we also demonstrate that survival benefits associated with 3MA is independent of tumor progression. Finally, we queried Perp expression in human tumor samples and observed increased Perp expression in adenocarcinoma regions compared to tumor adjacent tissue. Taken together, we report a novel mechanism linking 3-MA to Perp inhibition, and further implicate Perp as a novel tumor promoting factor in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c1b36833-8075-42c6-b4a8-be6260aa89e7\/@z03B8ZEH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,Aging,Pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12942"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aneesha Dasgupta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paige C.

Age-adjusted incidence among Caucasians is approx. twice that of Africans. Genetic changes in ethnicity may represent druggable targets for development of new treatments for GBM. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) with sequence homology to neuron-glial-2 (NG2), henceforth CSPG4\/NG2, is a transmembrane proteoglycan that is upregulated in GBM, resulting in leaky neovasculature and high cell proliferation, and is independently prognostic for poor survival. Mechanisms regulating CSPG4\/NG2 expression remain to be elucidated.<b><br \/>Experiments:<\/b> Tumor-derived DNA whole exome sequences (WES) from mixed American GBM patients (n=300) collected into the TCGA database and blood-derived DNA WES from controls (n = 2504) in the 1000 Genome database were analyzed for mutations in the <i>CSPG4<\/i> gene by GATK-3.5. We used prime editing (PE) to introduce a 13-base pair (bp) deletion through design of PE guide RNA (n=27), screening GBM cells (n=14) for CSPG4\/NG2 expression, transfecting and expanding PE cells, confirming editing using Sanger sequencing. We functionally characterized the mutation in PE cells and transplanted in orthotopic PDX mouse models compared to wild type (WT) and Cas9 control cells. Western blotting, BrdU proliferation assays, clonogenic- and wound healing assays were used to investigate function. Gelatin zymography assessed CSPG4\/NG2 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) cross-talk during invasion on mixed extracellular matrix- or collagen IV- coated transwells.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A novel 13bp frameshift deletion in exon 3 of the <i>CSPG4 <\/i>gene was identified from WES of GBM samples deposited in TCGA. The mutation was cancer specific (p&#60;0.001). Comparison of frequency in various ethnicities revealed the mutation to be more frequent among African American GBM patients (p=0.019). We generated 3 clones heterozygous for the CSPG4\/NG2 deletion in patient derived GBMs. A homozygous deletion was lethal to the cells. The 13bp deletion reduced CSPG4\/NG2 expression by approx. 60%, slowed tumor cell proliferation compared to both WT (p&#60;0.001) and Cas9 cells (p&#60;0.0001). PE cells had significantly reduced colony formation (p&#60;0.001), scratch wound healing (p&#60;0.001), had a weaker invasive phenotype when challenged with collagen IV (p&#60;0.001), and reduced cleavage of collagen I by MMP2 that was corroborated by RNAseq gene expression. Reduced growth of PE cells in vivo was verified by multiplex immunohistochemistry on ex vivo brain sections and identified biomarkers for differential tumor development. Tumor growth was reduced in vivo in mice.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b><b>: <\/b>We identified a novel 13bp deletion in CSPG4\/NG2 with phenotypic effect that could be used as a future molecular target in GBM treatment, and present the first successful application of PE in human GBM cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a00ebfbd-46eb-4270-a84f-59b00ce2a654\/@z03B8ZEH\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,CRISPR\/Cas9,Molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12943"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Victoria Smith Arnesen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susina Suntharalingam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>&#379;aneta Matuszek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shahin Sarowar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stian Knappskog<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stein Atle Lie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David R.

Ribosomes are a molecular machine that acts as a hub for protein synthesis, and dysregulation of ribosome function is causative for cancer formation. Our investigation on the causes of breast cancer progression has identified a small molecule &#8216;SU056&#8217; that shows efficacy against TNBC models. SU056 treatment inhibits growth and clonogenic potential of TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SUM159, 4T1, EMT6 and E0771), by arresting the cell cycle progression through G2\/M phase. Proteomics analysis suggested translational process as a target of SU056 in these cells. We found that its treatment modulated expression of several molecules of translational complex such as RPL (RPL9, RPL11, RPL15), RPS (RPSA, RPS9, RPS16, RPS20), and translation initiation factors (eIF6, eIF5, eIF4A, eIF4G), which leads to overall inhibition. This was further confirmed by tumor xenograft study with different TNBC models, which also showed that metastatic nodules in the lungs were inhibited by SU056 compared to control group.

Aberrant Notch1 activation, particularly in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) in TNBC tumors, enhances this cancer's aggressivity and resistance and consequently contributes to the poor overall survival of patients with TNBC. In contrast, inhibition of Notch1 has been shown to suppress TNBC growth. Thus, Notch1 presents as an attractive target for inhibiting TNBC growth. This study aims to overcome the limitations of current Notch1 inhibitors and identify a more specific inhibitor.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Small molecule screening was performed using structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, and molecular docking and isothermal calorimetric (ITC) assays were used to determine the target sites of our rationally designed Notch1 inhibitor on the Notch1 receptor. The therapeutic potential of the identified small molecule Notch1 inhibitor was determined on BCSC and TNBC (ALDH+, BCSC, ALDH-, MDA-MB-231) cell lines using molecular studies and in vivo assays.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified ASR490, a small molecule that binds to the NRR (the activation switch of the Notch receptor) of Notch1. Molecular docking studies indicated a strong interaction between ASR490 and the NRR domain with binding energy of -52.55 kcal\/mol. Residue-wise interaction analysis estimated three hydrogen-bond interactions between ASR490 and NRR residues Asn-1483, Glu-1673, and Gly-1664 mediated by water molecules. The finding was further confirmed using biophysical assays (thermal shift assay and isothermal calorimetric analysis) using recombinant Notch1 protein. In vitro results demonstrated that ASR490 significantly inhibited TNBC growth (p &#60;0.001) at nM concentrations, with an IC50 of 760 nM at 24h. Further, the inhibitory effect was confirmed by TNBC&#8217;s colony-forming abilities. Western blot analysis confirmed that ASR490 downregulated the expressions of NICD (the active form of Notch1) and its downstream effectors Hey-1 and HES1 by ubiquitinating NRR of Notch1. ASR490 was found to be non-toxic to healthy cells. Moreover, ASR490 exhibited a maximum tolerated dose of more than 100 mg\/kg body weight in mice and abrogated TNBC tumor growth in vivo xenograft models.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our results demonstrate ASR490 as a potential therapeutic agent that abolishes Notch1 signaling in TNBC and BCSCs by specifically targeting Notch1 NRR. Further investigation is required for the clinical translational potential of this agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7450120f-980d-43bc-a513-538af2959ddd\/@A03B8ZEJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Small molecule inhibitor,Notch-1,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12946"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Uttara Saran<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Balaji Chandrasekaran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashish Tyagi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amandeep Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murali K.

Leading sources of BM are cancers of the lung, breast and melanoma, which together account for approximately 80% of all BM. Unfortunately, current clinical modalities for BM including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy still offer limited efficacy and median survival times of 4 - 12 months in treated patients, emphasizing the need for more effective therapeutic strategies and generally a better understanding of the disease. We recently identified the presence of stem-like cells termed &#8220;brain metastasis-initiating cells&#8221; or BMICs in patient-derived BM from lung, breast and melanoma cancers that are able to recapitulate the complete brain metastatic cascade in pre-clinical models of BM. Through these models, we serendipitously captured lung, breast and melanoma BMICs at the &#8220;pre-metastatic&#8221; stage of BM - a stage where circulating metastatic cells have seeded the brain, but not yet formed full-blown (macro-metastatic) brain lesions. Transcriptomic analysis of pre-metastatic and macro-metastatic lung, breast and melanoma BMICs revealed a unique genetic profile in pre-metastatic BMICs that was distinct from their macro-metastatic counterparts. Further analysis identified several genes commonly up-regulated in all pre-metastatic BMIC cohorts irrespective of their primary tumour of origin. Intriguingly, we found that inhibition of the non-classical human leukocyte class I antigen-G or HLA-G gene (one of the top up-regulated genes in the pre-metastatic cohorts), reduced the ability of BMICs to form mature brain lesions. Correspondingly, HLA-G over-expression increased the capacity of BMICs to establish secondary brain tumours. Mechanistically, we discovered that over-expressing HLA-G levels in BMICs (to simulate the high levels that occurs in pre-metastatic BMICs), increased the activation of STAT3 signalling and this was mediated in part via a novel HLA-G binding partner - SPAG9. Our work thus uncovered a potential cooperative role between HLA-G, SPAG9 and STAT3 signalling during the early stages of BM. Indeed, attenuation of SPAG9 protein levels or STAT3 signalling in HLA-G over-expressing BMICs using CRISPR knockout and a STAT3 inhibitor respectively obstructed the ability of high HLA-G levels to promote mature brain lesions. This is the first study to reveal a role for an HLA-G-SPAG9-STAT3 axis in BM and highlights the potential of targeting this axis to inhibit BM, which will markedly extend patient survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/24d320e8-283d-4e02-b5f0-9ccdc81a85e0\/@A03B8ZEJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Cancer stem cells,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12947"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Blessing I.

These <i>BRAF<\/i>-WT tumors are a significant clinical problem, despite the fact that these tumors commonly possess mutations in <i>NF1<\/i> or RAS genes, as there are no targeted therapeutics for these tumors. Here we demonstrate that <i>ERBB4<\/i> is sufficient and necessary for proliferation of <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanoma cell lines, suggesting that disrupting ERBB4 signaling may be effective against <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanomas.<br \/>ERBB4 (HER4) is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR\/ERBB1\/HER1), ERBB2 (Neu\/HER2), and ERBB3 (HER3). EGFR and ERBB2 are validated targets in a variety of solid tumors, whereas the roles that ERBB4 plays in human malignancies are ambiguous. Our previous <i>in silico<\/i> analyses of <i>BRAF<\/i>-WT tumor genomes in The Cancer Genome Atlas skin cutaneous melanoma (TCGA-SKCM) dataset suggest that <i>ERBB4<\/i> mutation or overexpression cooperates with <i>NF1<\/i> or RAS gene mutations to drive melanomas via activation of the PI3 kinase\/AKT signaling pathway. These in silico analyses have also enabled us to prioritize the <i>ERBB4<\/i> mutants found in <i>BRAF<\/i>-WT melanomas.<br \/>We have tested this hypothesis using a panel of human <i>BRAF<\/i>-WT melanoma cell lines. We have shown that expression of wild-type <i>ERBB4<\/i> causes increased clonogenic proliferation, whereas expression of a dominant-negative <i>ERBB4<\/i> mutant (K751M) causes decreased clonogenic proliferation. These data indicate that <i>ERBB4<\/i> is sufficient and necessary for clonogenic proliferation of <i>BRAF<\/i>-WT melanoma cell lines. Analgous studies are testing whether <i>ERBB4<\/i> regulates anchorage independence in semi-solid medium and proliferation rates and saturation density in culture dishes.<br \/>The <i>BRAF<\/i>-WT melanoma cell lines endogenously express ERBB4 ligands, EGFR, and ERBB2. Moreover, ERBB4 homodimers function as tumor suppressors, whereas ERBB4-EGFR and ERBB4-ERBB2 heterodimers are oncogenic. Thus, we are using gene silencing and pharmacologic tools to determine whether endogenous ERBB4 ligands, endogenous EGFR, or endogenous ERBB2 is required for the oncogenic activity of ERBB4. Furthermore, we are determining whether prioritized <i>ERBB4<\/i> mutants found in <i>BRAF<\/i>-WT melanomas exhibit greater signaling and oncogenic activities than WT <i>ERBB4<\/i>. Consequently, these experiments will establish a functional role for <i>ERBB4<\/i> mutations and expression in <i>BRAF<\/i>-WT melanomas and will identify potential strategies for disrupting oncogenic ERBB4 signaling in these tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1297a9a8-3c00-4d37-ba1e-a313cc2d11c9\/@A03B8ZEJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB receptors,Oncogene,Ras,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12948"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lauren M.

Over 105 models have been extensively characterized with regards to histology, invasion, flank and orthotopic growth rates, and molecular profiling. Evaluation of orthotopic tumors demonstrated infiltration of tumor cells into the brain parenchymal in 90% of models with contralateral hemisphere involvement in 64%. Extensive molecular profiling confirmed the PDX collection captures the genetic heterogeneity of GBM, with the majority of typical molecular alterations seen at a frequency similar to the TCGA including gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10. TERT promoter mutations (86%) and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (70%) were the most frequent. Additional alterations in the p53 pathway included TP53 mutations (36%) and MDM2\/4 amplification (10%\/2%). <i>IDH<\/i> mutations were found in three models while MGMT promoter methylation was observed in 45% of PDXs. The available molecular sequencing results are viewable on cBioPortal. These genetically diverse models are extremely useful for biomarker discovery and efficacy evaluations. Using an innovative 1x1x1 PDX preclinical trial design, we are establishing a workflow to evaluate control and drug treatment in an individual animal across PDX lines in the flank. As our first use of this strategy, a small molecule MDM2 inhibitor was evaluated in 17 PDX lines with variable <i>MDM2<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> statuses. Tumors harboring <i>MDM2<\/i> amplification without <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation (n=5) showed profound response, with 4 PDXs showing a complete response that lasted &#62;150 days. Response in <i>TP53<\/i> wild-type tumors lacking <i>MDM2 <\/i>amplification was variable, with a 1.9 to 4.8 fold longer time to endpoint (mean 3; median 2.7). A more traditionally powered intracranial efficacy study performed with one MDM2 amplified (GBM108) and two non-amplified (GBM14, GBM10) PDX lines confirmed these findings of reduced and more variable response to therapy in <i>MDM2<\/i> non-amplified <i>TP53<\/i> wild-type tumors. Future studies will aim to examine novel biomarkers indicative of therapeutic response to better understand molecular features associated with MDM2 inhibitor efficacy. With over 20 years of experience, our group has extensive expertise in development of clinically relevant study designs focused on examining efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic assessments. Our diverse collection of clinically relevant GBM PDX models provides a highly sought-after resource which has been utilized by the pharmaceutical community with 58 working relationships to date (26 contracts, 32 collaborations). Through these collaborations, we aim to expand the use of our highly characterized GBM PDX panel for biomarker discovery using similar strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/483c6c8f-4665-4fe2-a7fc-a67de9b42fca\/@A03B8ZEJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Glioblastoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12949"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Danielle M.

It has a high mortality rate, even after successful first-line treatment with debulking surgery and chemotherapy. Although therapeutic options for targeted therapy are rapidly expanding, identification of patients who respond to these therapies remains a challenge. In recognition of the importance of the functional phenotype of cancer cells, Verhaegh <i>et al. <\/i>(Cancer Res 2014) developed assays to measure functional activity of signal transduction pathways (STPs) based on mRNA expression levels of pathway-specific target genes. In this study, we aimed to identify HGSCs with STP activity with a potential clinical target by comparing their activity with STP activity in normal Fallopian tube epithelium (FTE), the tissue of origin of most HGSCs.<br \/>Methods: We included 50 primary tumor samples taken prior to start of chemotherapy of postmenopausal patients diagnosed with advanced stage HGSC and 9 morphologically normal FTE samples of healthy postmenopausal women. Using pathway assays, we assessed functional pathway activity of the androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER), PI3K, MAPK, Hedgehog, TGF&#946; and Notch pathways. Differences in STP activity between groups were compared with Mann-Whitney U tests. Cut-off value for aberrant STP activity was defined as two standard deviations above the mean value of STP activity measured in FTE samples.<br \/>Results: In the HGSC group we observed lower median ER (p &#60; 0.001) pathway activity and higher median PI3K (p &#60; 0.001), Hedgehog (p &#60; 0.001) and TGF&#946; pathway (p = 0.020) activity as compared to the FTE group. In individual HGSC samples, aberrant activity was identified for the MAPK (n = 10), PI3K (n = 22), Hedgehog (n = 28) and TGF&#946; (n = 21) pathways. Frequently observed combinations of aberrant STP activity were Hedgehog\/TGF&#946; (n = 12) and Hedgehog\/PI3K (n = 9). In total, we identified at least one STP with potential clinical target in 88% (44\/50) of HGSC samples.<br \/>Conclusions: Our analysis enabled the identification of STP activity with a potential clinical target in 88% of the analyzed HGSC samples. Differentiation between normal and aberrant STP activity could have clinical utility in the selection of HGSC patients for targeted therapy. A prospective study (STAPOVER) has been designed to demonstrate clinical utility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9a9ac1c1-78e0-4710-b112-ded5238a2d90\/@A03B8ZEJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Signal transduction pathways,Hedgehog,PI3K,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12950"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Phyllis Van der Ploeg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yvonne J.W.

Although 70% of patients initially respond to platinum-based therapy, &#38;gt;90% succumb to chemoresistance. There is a need to uncover targeted drugs for ovarian cancer. A quicker, more cost-effective, and lower-risk route to identify new treatments is through repurposing FDA approved drugs. Using a computational drug repositioning platform, DrugPredict, we previously uncovered that the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone potently decreases cell viability and triggers apoptosis in numerous patient-derived ovarian cancer cell lines through the degradation of c-Myc. However, given the dose-limiting toxicity of amiodarone, we applied structure-activity relationship to identify DL78, which lacks hERG activity but retains the anti-cancer properties and ability to regulate Myc. DL78 is significantly more potent and tumor specific than amiodarone. It rapidly induces G2\/M arrest which ultimately leads to loss of Myc, mitotic catastrophe, and apoptosis in several types of cancer cells. Furthermore, pharmacokinetics studies show that the compound is retained in the tumor upon intraperitoneal injection and has reasonable solubility and permeability, yielding good absorption, distinct from amiodarone. Given its structural and molecular differences, we expect that DL78 works through a different mechanism that amiodarone and could represent an effective treatment for ovarian cancer and other MYC-driven tumors. Additional studies will establish the foundation for further development of this novel compound, as well as reveal targeted ovarian cancer vulnerabilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a4f3805-fa2e-40a3-8b2c-3735b4dbf7f0\/@A03B8ZEJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle arrest,Myc,Ovarian cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12951"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"5eae37c6-b329-482d-b21d-33f164b1ba4a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5eae37c6-b329-482d-b21d-33f164b1ba4a\/@A03B8ZEJ\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jessica McAnulty<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Dziubinski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agharnan Gandhi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Margaret Farah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pil Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew D.

During tumor evolution, disruption of these functional redundancies can create <i>de novo<\/i> vulnerabilities that are specific to cancer cells. In this regard, paralog genes are of particular interest, as the loss of one paralog gene can render tumor cells dependent on a remaining paralog. To systematically identify cancer-relevant paralog dependencies, we searched for candidate dependencies using CRISPR screens and publicly available loss-of-function datasets. Our analysis revealed &#62;2,000 potential candidate dependencies, several of which were subsequently experimentally validated. We provide evidence that <i>DNAJC15-DNAJC19<\/i>, <i>FAM50A-FAM50B<\/i> and <i>RPP25-RPP25L<\/i> are novel cancer relevant paralog dependencies. Importantly, our analysis also revealed unexpected redundancies between sex chromosome genes. We show that chrX- and chrY- encoded paralogs, as exemplified by <i>ZFX-ZFY<\/i>, <i>DDX3X-DDX3Y<\/i> and <i>EIF1AX-EIF1AY<\/i>, are functionally linked so that tumor cell lines from male patients with Y-chromosome loss become exquisitely dependent on the chrX-encoded gene. We therefore propose genetic redundancies between chrX- and chrY- encoded paralogs as a general therapeutic strategy for human tumors that have lost the Y-chromosome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c622a3fd-d146-4bbf-987b-75ec99dbd5ce\/@A03B8ZEJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,Genetic susceptibility,Target discovery,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12952"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Köferle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Schlattl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Hörmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fiona Spreitzer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Popa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Venu Thatikonda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa Puchner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Verena Supper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madhwesh C.
