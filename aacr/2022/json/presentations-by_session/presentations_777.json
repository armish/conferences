[{"Abstract":"Background: In patients (pts) with previously treated aHCC, pembro demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety vs placebo (pbo) in the phase 3 KEYNOTE-240 (NCT02702401) and KEYNOTE-394 (NCT03062358) studies in global and Asian populations, respectively. The hazard ratio ([HR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) for OS was 0.781 (0.611-0.998) in KEYNOTE-240 and 0.79 (0.63-0.99) in KEYNOTE-394; HR (95% CI) for PFS was 0.78 (0.61-0.99) and 0.74 (0.60-0.92), respectively. ORR differences with pembro vs pbo were similar in KEYNOTE-240 (13.8% [95% CI, 7.7-19.5]) and KEYNOTE-394 (11.4% [95% CI, 6.7-16.0]). We performed a prespecified meta-analysis of KEYNOTE-240 and KEYNOTE-394 to obtain a more precise estimate of the pembro treatment effect.<br \/>Methods: In KEYNOTE-240 and KEYNOTE-394, pts with confirmed aHCC and progression or intolerance to sorafenib or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (KEYNOTE-394 only) were randomized 2:1 to pembro (200 mg IV Q3W) or pbo for &#8804;35 cycles, both with best supportive care. Inclusion\/exclusion criteria were similar. Meta-analysis of pt data pooled from the ITT population of the pembro and pbo arms of each study was completed. OS, PFS (blinded independent central review [BICR] per RECIST 1.1), and ORR (BICR per RECIST 1.1) were assessed.<br \/>Results: In total, 578 pts who received pembro and 288 who received pbo were included. The HR for OS and PFS and the difference in ORR for pembro vs pbo in all pts was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.93), 0.76 (0.64-0.89), and 12.5 (8.8-16.2), respectively (Table). Results were consistent across subgroups, including viral etiology, BCLC stage, and age.<br \/>Conclusions: This meta-analysis of two studies with similar design, inclusion\/exclusion criteria, and endpoints, showed improvement in OS, PFS, and ORR with pembro vs pbo across studies. These data also show consistent outcomes between the studies, providing further evidence for the benefit of second-line pembro for aHCC globally.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{46588249-7491-4575-9948-FF8026F9085B}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">All Patients<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">Patients With Sorafenib-Treated aHCC<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Pembrolizumab(n = 578)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Placebo(n = 288)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Pembrolizumab(n = 550)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Placebo (n = 274)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OS, median (95% CI), mo<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14.2 (12.8-16.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12.5 (10.2-13.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14.2 (12.8-16.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12.5 (10.4-13.6)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI)<sup>a,b<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.79 (0.67-0.93)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.78 (0.66-0.92)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PFS, median (95% CI), mo<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.8 (2.7-2.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.7 (1.6-2.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.8 (2.7-2.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.7 (1.6-2.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI)<sup>a,b<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.76 (0.64-0.89)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.76 (0.64-0.90)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR, % (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.4 (12.6-18.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.8 (1.2-5.4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.6 (12.7-18.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.9 (1.3-5.7)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Estimated treatment difference, (95% CI)<sup>b,c<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">12.5 (8.8-16.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">12.6 (8.8-16.4)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">aHCC, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.<sup>a<\/sup>Stratified Cox proportional hazard model with treatment as a single covariate and Efron’s method of tie handling was used to estimate the OS and PFS HR and its 95% CI.<sup>b<\/sup>Stratification was performed per protocol and within each protocol, by strata used in the analysis of the respective protocol.<sup>c<\/sup>Miettinen &amp; Nurminen method was used to estimate the difference in ORR and its 95% CI.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/24a81de0-14c8-4ba0-9cf3-987960546bde\/@z03B8ZYy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Anti-PD-1,Pembrolizumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20285"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Richard S.

We report updated 36-month follow-up data.<br \/>Methods: 296 pts with previously untreated advanced ALK+ NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to oral lorlatinib (100 mg QD; n=149) or crizotinib (250 mg BID; n=147), stratified by presence of CNS metastases (mets) and ethnicity. Primary endpoint: PFS by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival, PFS by investigator, and objective response (OR), IC-OR, IC time to progression (IC-TTP), duration of response (DR), IC-DR (all by BICR), and safety.<br \/>Results: At data cutoff (Sep 20, 2021), median duration of follow-up for PFS was 36.7 months for lorlatinib and 29.3 months for crizotinib. Median PFS by BICR was NR (95% CI, NR-NR) for lorlatinib and 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.6-11.1) for crizotinib (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.18-0.39). PFS by investigator results were similar (Table). For pts with brain mets at baseline (n=37 lorlatinib\/n=39 crizotinib), the HR for IC-TTP for lorlatinib vs crizotinib was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.04-0.27), and for pts without brain mets (n=112\/n=108) was 0.02 (95% CI, 0.002-0.14). OR, IC-OR, DR, and IC-DR were all improved with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (Table). All-cause grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 76% and 7% of pts with lorlatinib and 57% and 10% of pts with crizotinib, respectively. No new safety signals emerged.<br \/>Conclusions: These updated long-term data from CROWN confirm the efficacy of lorlatinib over crizotinib in pts with treatment-na&#239;ve ALK+ NSCLC, with no new safety signals detected, and support the use of lorlatinib in pts with untreated ALK+ NSCLC with and without brain mets.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been implicated in metastasis, treatment resistance and recurrence of HHGs. We have shown in several clinical studies that anti-CSC-directed therapy provides benefits in many cancer types; however, this is the first report of a randomized clinical trial evaluating it for recurrent HGGs. Objective: Determine whether CSC-targeted cytotoxic agents selected by ChemoID assay-guided therapy improves survival in patients with recurrent HGG.<br \/>Design, Settings, and Participants: In this parallel-group, randomized, phase-3 clinical trial, patients at 13 clinical sites in the USA with grade-III\/IV recurrent glioma (2016 WHO guidelines) were randomized 1:1 to either ChemoID assay-guided therapy or physician-choice therapy, and then treated and followed until unacceptable toxic effects, hospice, or death.<br \/>Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: Combined median follow-up was 9 months. Median OS (mOS) was 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.2-14.7) in the ChemoID assay-guided group vs 9 months (95% CI, 4.2-13.8) in the physician-choice group (log-rank <i>P <\/i>= .010). Risk of death was significantly lower in the ChemoID assay group (HR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.24-0.81; <i>P<\/i> = .008). Median progression free survival (PFS) was 10.1 vs 3.5 months (95% CI, 4.8-15.4 vs 1.9-5.1) (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14-0.44; <i>P<\/i> &#60; .001).<br \/>Conclusions and Relevance: Primary endpoint was met in this randomized clinical trial. The mOS was 3.5 months longer in the ChemoID assay-guided group vs the physician-choice group demonstrating the clinical advantage of treating HGG patients using CSC personalized therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ef216710-f2cf-40fe-8cfd-4a856695aeea\/@z03B8ZYy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer cell,Stem cells,Chemoresistance,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20287"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"f5d70194-99a1-46c6-b8e4-f2e50eabbd15","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f5d70194-99a1-46c6-b8e4-f2e50eabbd15\/@z03B8ZYy\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tulika Ranjan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Soma Sengupta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Candace M.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of a comprehensive approach to precision medicine, including genomic and bio-informatic analysis of tumor biopsies, as well as modeling of the disease in Avatar Mouse Models and Patient Derived Organoids (PDO) to conventional treatment.<br \/>Method: We conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial in which, patients with newly diagnosed advanced PDAC were randomized to either a personalized medicine approach or to a conventional treatment in a 2:1 ratio. Patients randomized to the conventional arm were treated with standard of care therapy. Patients randomized to the experimental arm underwent a tumor biopsy to determine their genetic status through whole exome sequencing (WES) and to generate an Avatar and PDO model. Personalized treatment was based on the targets identified by genetic and bioinformatic analysis, as well as by phenotypic screening of 40 anticancer agents in the patient derived models after discussion in a molecular committee.<br \/>Results: A total 129 PDAC patients with a median age of 62 years old, were enrolled and 122 were included in the analysis. Seventy-eight patients were randomized to the experimental arm and 44 to the conventional one. WES has been performed in 66 patients and in 56 of them potentially actionable pathogenic variants were detected. Experimental models were successfully generated in 28 patients and screened. However, only 4 patients were treated with selected agents. The remaining 52 patients could not be treated according to the results of the study: 73% of them because of premature clinical deterioration, 8% because of delaying in obtaining results due to technical matters and 19% because the recommended treatment was not felt to have adequate data support by the molecular committee. The median overall survival (from the date of randomization until the date of death) was 8,7 months for patients from conventional arm and 8,8 months for patients from experimental arm (not statistically different). The median overall survival (from the date of randomization until the date of death) for the four patients treated according to the results of the study was 19,5 months.<br \/>Conclusions: In our study, a full personalized medicine approach did not improve the overall survival of patients with PDAC. Failure to obtain genomic data and models, lack of actionable genetic alterations and targeted agents in living models, and the rapid course of PDAC limited the implementation of precision medicine treatments. Outcome was improved in the 6% of patients in whom a personalized treatment was administered.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8d900869-75d2-4ad2-8ed6-e14b4691a553\/@z03B8ZYy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Xenografts,Organoids,Whole exome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20288"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manuel Hidalgo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Sarno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Medina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto Pazo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignacio Juez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rocío García-Carbonero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Guillén-Ponce<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaime Feliú<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolina Alonso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jair Tenorio_Castano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pablo Lapunzina<\/i><\/presenter>.

Toripalimab, a humanized IgG4K monoclonal antibody specific for PD-1, in combination with GP chemotherapy showed significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) as first-line treatment for RM-NPC at the interim analysis of the JUPITER-02 study (NCT03581786), a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded international Phase III trial. Here we report the results of the final PFS analysis and the interim overall survival (OS) analysis.<br \/>Methods: Patients (n=289) with advanced NPC with no prior chemotherapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting were randomized (1:1) to receive toripalimab 240 mg (n=146) or placebo (n=143) in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin every 3 weeks (Q3W) for up to 6 cycles, followed by monotherapy with toripalimab or placebo Q3W until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or completion of 2 years of treatment. Stratification factors were ECOG PS (0 <i>vs.<\/i> 1) and extent of disease (recurrent <i>vs. <\/i>primary metastatic) at enrollment. Tumor response was assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) per RECIST v1.1. The primary endpoint was PFS by BIRC in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points included PFS by investigator, OS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and safety.<br \/>Results: At the final PFS analysis, the median follow-up time was 22.1 months for the toripalimab arm and 21.4 months for the placebo arm by the cut-off date of June 8, 2021. The toripalimab arm had a significantly longer PFS than the placebo arm as assessed by BIRC: median PFS 21.4 vs. 8.2 months, HR=0.52 (95% CI: 0.37-0.73), two-sided p&#60;0.0001. The 1-year PFS rates were 59.0% vs. 32.9%. The ORR was 78.8% vs. 67.1% (P=0.022) and the median DOR was 18.0 vs. 6.0 months, HR= 0.49 (95% CI: 0.33-0.72). Consistently, PFS as assessed by investigator was also significantly longer in the toripalimab arm than the placebo arm: median PFS 17.3 vs. 8.1 months, HR=0.43 (95% CI: 0.31-0.58), P&#60;0.0001. As of June 8, 2021, the median OS was not reached in either arm, with a trend favoring the toripalimab arm, HR=0.59 (95% CI: 0.37-0.94), P=0.024. The improvements of PFS and OS in the toripalimab arm were observed across key subgroups, including PD-L1 expression subgroups. Notably, dynamic decrease of plasma Epstein-Barr Virus DNA copy number from baseline was associated with favorable response. No new safety signal was identified. The incidence of Grade &#8805;3 adverse events (AEs) (89.7% vs 90.2%) and fatal AEs (2.7% vs 2.8%) were similar between the two arms; however, investigator-determined immune-related AEs (irAEs) (53.4% vs. 21.7%) and Grade &#8805;3 irAEs (8.9% vs. 1.4%) were more frequent in the toripalimab arm.<br \/>Conclusions: The addition of toripalimab to GP chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced NPC had a manageable safety profile and provided superior PFS with a favorable trend in overall survival than chemotherapy alone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09617b0b-4a29-446c-a88f-cb9f6a3e29dd\/@z03B8ZYy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Anti-PD-1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20289"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hai-Qiang Mai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiu-Yan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chaosu Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kunyu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiyu Wen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingao Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingrui Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruilian Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianji Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shenhong Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ping Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunhong Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Chun Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xia He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hung-Ming Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wan-Teck Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Rui-Hua Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, Coherus Biosciences and Shanghai Junshi Biosciences.
