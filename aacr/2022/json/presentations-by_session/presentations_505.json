[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Treatment of patients with locally advanced lung cancer includes platinum-based chemoradiation followed by anti-PD-L1\/PD-1 immunotherapy. Over half of patients receiving this treatment have disease progression and may be re-challenged with further platinum or immunotherapy, or instead be treated with an approved third line (3L) therapy similar to that for patients initially diagnosed with stage IV disease that progressed on platinum and immunotherapy. It is unknown whether treatment outcomes and prognosis in the stage III setting, particularly in patients with early disease progression, mirror the stage IV setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate current real-world practice patterns and survival for patients with stage III vs IV disease previously treated with platinum and immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The Flatiron NSCLC database was used to identify patients whose disease progressed after platinum chemotherapy and anti-PD-L1\/PD-1 therapy, and to further classify them as 1) stage III early progressors (&#8804; 6 months) after sequential platinum and durvalumab, 2) stage III late progressors (&#62; 6 months) after sequential platinum and durvalumab, and 3) stage IV progressors after concurrent or sequential platinum and anti-PD-L1\/PD-1 therapy. The proportion of stage III patients receiving additional platinum or immunotherapy vs approved 3L therapy (docetaxel &#177; ramucirumab, pemetrexed, or gemcitabine) was then evaluated. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare median overall survival in the stage III groups and the stage IV group starting the next line of treatment after initial platinum and immunotherapy, and adjusting for ECOG performance status, smoking history, histology, PD-L1 status, age, sex, and race.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Patients identified as receiving their first-line therapy between December 2017 and November 2020 included 143 stage III early progressors, 120 stage III late progressors and 876 stage IV patients. After initial platinum and immunotherapy, 34% of stage III early progressors received platinum or immunotherapy and 12% received approved 3L therapy. 39% of stage III late progressors received platinum or immunotherapy and 15% received approved 3L therapy. Median overall survival for early vs late stage III progressors did not significantly differ (10.1 vs 14.3 months; HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.51; <i>P<\/i>=0.67). Survival in stage III patients was longer than that in stage IV patients (median 6.2 months) among both early progressors (HR, 0.60; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.82; <i>P<\/i>=0.002) and late progressors (HR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.34; <i>P<\/i>=0.001).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Patients with stage III NSCLC that progressed on initial platinum and immunotherapy were more likely to be re-challenged with platinum or immunotherapy than to immediately proceed to 3L therapy. These patients also had longer survival than analogous stage IV patients, regardless of progression timing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c1fe596a-1f40-4ac7-acea-5bb6aa749c1d\/@A03B8ZPq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-07 Real world evidence and retrospective analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15643"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Palak Kundu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Gondos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomohiro Tanaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elaine Chun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus Ballinger<\/i><\/presenter>.

Assessing biomarker-targeted therapies within these small populations in adequately powered randomized trials is becoming unfeasible, leading to reliance on lower quality evidence from uncontrolled studies using unvalidated surrogate outcomes. When robust evidence for a targeted therapy being considered already exists in common cancers, this evidence may potentially be extrapolated to support the use of this therapy in rare cancers sharing the same biomarker and reduce additional evidence requirements for regulatory or reimbursement approval. However, extrapolation may not be appropriate in some settings due to biological differences between cancer types.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>Building on recommendations for core components of extrapolation identified from a scoping review of methodological guidance, we constructed a framework proposing criteria for extrapolating evidence for targeted therapies from common to rare cancers.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> Criteria reflect key assumptions of disease similarity when defined by the biomarker and similarity of treatment response. Criteria are judged under five extrapolation components: (1) Analytical validity of the test used to identify the biomarker and criteria used to define biomarker status in the rare cancer, (2) Strength of evidence supporting biomarker actionability in the rare cancer and evidence that actionability may differ from the common cancer, (3) Quantitative estimation of the natural history of the biomarker-defined rare cancer as control group, (4) Validity of surrogate endpoints used to extrapolate treatment effect from the common cancer and predictions of clinical benefit in the rare cancer, and (5) Similarity of the safety profile between cancers and methods to augment safety data in the rare cancer. Using these criteria, decision-makers can judge whether sufficient evidence exists to support extrapolation or identify specific knowledge gaps to better target further research to be able to judge whether extrapolation is appropriate or not. Residual uncertainties for fulfilling criteria can also define post-approval commitments.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> We outline a pragmatic and systematic approach for selecting and evaluating existing evidence to judge when extrapolation is appropriate. This framework can be used to promote standardized, comprehensive, and transparent decision-making and facilitate discussion between stakeholders in drug development and clinical guideline and health technology assessment groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/85b8af13-7623-433f-abcf-7c38d2f966e2\/@B03B8ZPr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Biomarkers,Framework,Extrapolation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18877"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Doah Cho<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah J.

The first step in cancer control is identifying where the cancer burden is elevated, which suggests locations where interventions are needed. Geographic information systems (GIS) and other spatial analytic methods provide such a solution and thus can play a major role in cancer control. Our objective is to combine computational epidemiological and GIS tools to identify, map and explain racial disparities in cervical cancer treatment in Alabama, especially in the Black Belt counties (BBCs) of Alabama.<br \/><b>Methodology<\/b>: Data obtained from ADPH\/Cancer Registry were used in this study. ArcGIS 10.4 software was utilized to create maps along with graphs showing variation in cervical cancer treatment by race, stage at diagnosis, location and stratified by age groups and to measure geographical accessibility of cervical cancer patients to health care facilities. Accessibility was measured based on 10, 20, 30, 40 and50 miles multiple buffer distance from the city of Tuskegee, to sexually transmitted diseases (STD), clinics and hospitals.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Overall, Blacks and Whites Alabamians who were diagnosed with cervical cancer were significantly less likely to receive treatments (surgery, radiation, surgery and radiation and chemotherapy). Blacks, who were living in rural BBCs, diagnosed with four stages of cervical cancer, stratified by the age groups (17 to 49, 50 to 64, 65 to 74 and 75 to 100 years), and underwent the four above mentioned treatment, had the highest Prevalence Rates (PR) of cervical cancer compared to their White counterparts. The ideal distance for cancer patients to the hospital shall be less than 12.4 miles away to avoid pain and discomfort during the travel. Our results show that out of seven STD clinics, ten health care centers and six hospitals are located in Macon County, and nearby Alabama counties. There are only two health care centers, namely Macon County Health Department and Tuskegee Quality Health Care Medical Clinic, which have an ideal location (around 1.9 to 2.5 and 4.0 to 6.3 miles respectively from Macon County). However, it provides only Pap smear, but no treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: We proved that disparity in outcomes result from unequal access to care and\/or differences in the quality of care received. Also, factors that ultimately contribute to differences in outcome include access to timely treatment, factors which may be affected by race and age, as well as location differences. The findings could be used for planning better health care deliveries, especially in sparsely populated areas of Alabama.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a674d20-5979-40c6-b16c-a5f529ae4beb\/@B03B8ZPr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-01 Cancer health disparities,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: cervical,Race,Databases,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18878"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ehsan Abdalla<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Nganwa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Souleymane Fall<\/i><\/presenter>.

These legal issues can cause people unnecessary worry, confusion, and stress, and can be overwhelming. The Insurance and Finance Intensive provides health care professionals tools to proactively identify the presence of cancer-related legal, insurance, and financial issues facing their patients. Additionally, the training helps health care professionals to offer referrals to appropriate legal and related resources, once those issues are identified. Oncology health care professionals participated in an eight-hour comprehensive training. Attendees were provided with substantive information about cancer-related legal issues, such as identifying health insurance options, navigating taking time off work and accessing disability insurance, and managing finances. A follow-up survey was sent to past 2020 and 2021 Intensive attendees (n=126), to measure the effectiveness of the training and to address additional questions and difficult case studies. Ninety-four percent of survey respondents indicated that they changed their behavior or practice based on what they learned at the training. Ninety-four percent of survey respondents strongly agreed or agreed that the information provided by the training helped reduce the financial burden that their patients and families experience after a cancer diagnosis. Ninety-seven percent of respondents strongly agreed or agreed that the information provided by the training improved the quality of life of their patients and families. The Insurance &#38; Finance Intensive successfully provided health care professionals with valuable information on the practical and legal issues that impact individuals diagnosed with cancer.

COEs work with community stakeholders identifying community needs, communicating research, and catalyzing significant activities to Cancer Center&#8217;s catchment areas. To facilitate this, the University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) Office of COE established the Research Outreach for Southern Arizona (ROSA) program, supporting bidirectional partnerships between basic scientists and underrepresented communities in catchment areas.<br \/>Objective: To describe a community and student ambassador program developed as ROSA, bridging gaps between basic science programs and community needs in UACC catchment areas.<br \/>Methods: The UACC catchment areas include five southern Arizona counties where 40% of residents are Hispanic, compared to 18.3% in the US. Moreover, ambassadors were bilingual\/bicultural Hispanic undergraduate students (n=4) and Hispanic community members (n=4). The ambassador program held weekly cancer educational discussions, research methods, monthly Meet the Scientist events, and presentations on experiences. Evaluations for ROSA were completed by all affiliates.<br \/>Results: Overall, ROSA ambassadors reported increased knowledge of research and increased confidence sharing cancer information. Facilitators of ROSA community members included a bilingual\/bicultural team, outreach collaborations, and participant compensation. Barriers included payments for undocumented members, lack of Spanish-speaking scientists, and reduced in-person activities. As a result of ROSA partnerships, scientists, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders is developing Scientific Cafes where scientists present research proposals for community feedback. The workgroup will select a community-driven project to implement in the future.<br \/>Discussion: Based on positive ambassador evaluations and working group collaborations, ROSA is successful in growing authentic partnerships between scientists and communities. Recently, a community-based survey was developed by members to examine perceptions of cancer and willingness of clinical research participation. This survey will inform how basic scientists align research within community needs. ROSA will continue to be valuable in providing bidirectional engagement from basic scientists and community members in cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e7a3a09-f173-4d98-bcd0-303aa89d8f8e\/@B03B8ZPr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-01 Cancer health disparities,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Cancer,Cancer risk,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18995"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Gabriela Ruiz, MEd.<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Amanda Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

It can be described as the ability to achieve, process, understand, and apply genomic knowledge to health-related decision-making. The aim of this study is to assess the level of genomic literacy, including the knowledge of genetic testing, its outcomes, and its significance among medical trainees and practitioners in Pakistan. This study also offers recommendations for improving genomic literacy within the medical community in Pakistan. A cross-sectional study for which an online questionnaire was designed in the English language using Google Forms. The questionnaire was distributed among trainees and practitioners across Pakistan through online social media platforms. The survey comprised of 36 questions categorized into three sections namely demographics, quantitative questions, and knowledge section. A total of 219 medical professionals (56% trained in medicine while 44% in Dentistry) responded to the survey. Medical practitioners from 27 different cities across Pakistan participated in the survey but with a clear bias towards the city of Peshawar (90%). The majority of the participants (57.5%) were trainee medical officers. Most of the participants in this cohort were aware of genetics, the genome, and PCR technology but 74.9% were not familiar with genetic tests in their specialty. The mean total score for the multiple-choice questions among the participants was 62.5% graduates of medicine (65%) outperforming those in dentistry (59%). Participants were asked about their interest in further learning opportunities about genomics, for which 71% answered in affirmation, however, the remaining were not overly interested. Genomic literacy level can be considered satisfactory at the level of classical genetics, yet there is a clear need for training in molecular biology concepts such as protein synthesis, gene expression, and genome structure within the medical community. With a limited sample size and diversity of respondents, the subject warrants a broader survey to assess genomic literacy which can help in better planning for wider adoption of genomic testing in the medical community. Findings of this survey also highlight the need for assessing medical communities in other low-resource and underprivileged settings to help enhance our understanding and avoid a looming &#8216;genomics divide&#8217;.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/25f09b4e-66bf-448c-aade-349c60ee6011\/@B03B8ZPr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-04 Implementation science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Genomic literacy,Genomic knowledge, attitude, and practice ,Medical Professionals,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21373"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"b5a939f2-a26c-43ea-b384-db1700fe094c","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b5a939f2-a26c-43ea-b384-db1700fe094c\/@B03B8ZPr\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Madina Barakzai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shagufta Rehmat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faisal F.

Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression for the associations between multimorbidity (&#8805;2 comorbid conditions) and health behaviors, accounting for survey examination weights and covariates. Models were stratified by age at diagnosis and race\/ethnicity and statistical interactions were examined to evaluate effect modification.<br \/>Results: Overall, female cancer survivors with multimorbidity were more likely to be ever smokers (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI 1.08-1.85) and were significantly less likely to drink &#8805;2 alcoholic drinks\/day (aOR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.50-0.91) in comparison to female survivors without multimorbidity. This association with alcohol was significantly modified by race\/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white (NHW) survivors: aOR, 0.61; 95% CI 0.44-0.86; minority survivors aOR, 1.09; 95% CI 0.67-1.79; <i>p<\/i>-interaction=0.04) and age at diagnosis (&#8805;50 years of age at diagnosis: aOR, 0.44; 95% CI 0.28-0.69; &#60;50 years at diagnosis: aOR, 0.88; 95% 0.59-1.31; <i>p<\/i>-interaction=0.03). Overall, the association between multimorbidity and PA was not statistically significant. However, by race\/ethnicity, minority cancer survivors with multimorbidity were two times more likely to meet weekly PA recommendations (aOR, 2.10; 95% CI 1.29-3.41), in comparison with minority survivors without multimorbidity; and there was no association observed among NHW survivors (<i>p<\/i>-interaction=0.005). By age at diagnosis, women &#8805;50 years with multimorbidity were also more likely to meet PA recommendations (aOR, 1.65: 95% CI 1.04-2.62) while women &#60;50 years were less likely to meet PA recommendations (<i>p<\/i>-interaction=0.02).<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings indicate that female cancer survivors with multimorbidity are more likely to be ever smokers and less likely to drink &#8805;2 alcoholic drinks\/day. The associations between multimorbidity, alcohol consumption, and meeting PA recommendations significantly differed by race\/ethnicity and age at cancer diagnosis. Identification of at risk groups of female cancer survivors with multimorbidity can help inform more targeted behavioral intervention studies among these women who are at increased risk of poor outcomes due to their chronic health conditions and cancer history.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/efb27e46-9110-40db-bbfc-b8c6a22daed3\/@B03B8ZPr\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-02 Cancer survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Comorbidity,Cancer,Lifestyle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19213"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Avonne E.
