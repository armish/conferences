[{"Abstract":"Digital PCR (dPCR) is an emerging platform for detecting genomic variants in cancer genomes due to its high sensitivity and fast time to result compared to massively parallel sequencing. However, translational oncology applications often require the measurement of more biomarkers than there are color channels available on dPCR platforms. One approach to address this is to split a sample across many wells and profile a subset of variants in each well. For input-limited samples, however, this results in fewer molecules being profiled in each well, resulting in a reduction in sensitivity and fewer samples processed per instrument run.<br \/>ChromaCode has developed a research use only (RUO) high-definition digital PCR assay, for multiplexed detection of 14 DNA variants and 15 RNA fusion variants relevant in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples. The assay is constructed using both amplitude modulation and multi-channel resilient signal encoding methods. Amplitude modulation enables different variants to generate a signal at different intensity levels in single color channel, allowing for greater than <i>n <\/i>targets in <i>n<\/i> color channels.<i> <\/i>In contrast, resilient encoding generates a signal in more than one color channel to create a form of error detecting code.<br \/>DNA and RNA samples were obtained using a combination of synthetic templates, cell line nucleic acids, and commercially available reference materials. Samples were run with the HDPCR NSCLC RUO assay on the Thermo Fisher Absolute Q digital PCR system, and data analysis was performed with custom analysis algorithms. The HDPCR NSCLC RUO assay demonstrated a limit of detection as low as 10 variant copies in a 10,000 haploid human genome copy DNA background. By employing HDPCR technology on digital PCR systems, it is possible to build a comprehensive and sensitive research assay that quickly detects many genomic alterations relevant to NSCLC samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e6d15bfb-9665-444d-9567-d7d0a396c950\/@C03B8ZHy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,biomarker testing,PCR,multiplexing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16465"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Bryan Leatham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie McNall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Hari K.

Stilla Technologies&#8217; 6-color naica&#174; system is an ultrasensitive, easy-to-use digital PCR technology capable of quantifying multiple biomarkers in a single reaction.<br \/>The naica system workflow is comprised of optimized master mix reagents, microfluidic consumables, a 2-in-1 droplet generator and thermocycler, and a 6-color imager. For data analysis, the Crystal Miner analysis software allows for flexible sample analysis and inciteful data visualization. Altogether, the naica system workflow requires only a single pipetting step, thereby considerably limiting the variability contributed by the operator. The naica multiplex PCR MIX ensures optimal simultaneous quantification of multiple targets across the five-log dynamic range of the naica system, as well as robust quantification of low target concentrations in a highly abundant and complex DNA background. R&#178; scores &#62; 0.99 were obtained for all targets of a 6-color detection panel ranging from 0.2 to 13000 copies (cp)\/&#181;L.<br \/>As repeatability is a key performance criterion to evaluate the quality of a digital PCR system and detection assay, we also assessed the intra- and inter-run repeatability of the naica&#174; system with a 6-color assay. Three target concentrations from three different DNA sources were tested at 200, 2000, and 10,000 cp\/&#956;L. To allow robust statistical analysis on the means of concentration and variance of concentration, three runs of a total of 36 wells were performed for each target concentration using Stilla Technologies&#8217; highly sensitive Sapphire chip. Our results showed that at each of the three tested concentrations, the inter-run and intra-run variability of the 6-color naica&#174; system was less than 6%. For each of the three tested concentrations, no significant inter-run or intra-run differences (p&#60;0.05, two-tailed Mann-Whitney statistical test) were found, neither on the concentration level nor on the variance of concentration level. The absence of a significant difference implies that among multiple runs neither the well position in the chip nor the chip position in the Geode or Prism6 instrument has a significant impact on the results. Hence, any sample, including positive and negative control samples, can be loaded anywhere on the chips without significantly impacting the results, confirming high performance while ensuring ultimate flexibility in the experiment design.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72c791a6-e2d9-459c-af4f-79a33a1032e8\/@C03B8ZHy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Droplet digital PCR,Genomics,Mutation detection,Assay development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16466"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jean Fatien<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Foret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oriane Gourdy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison C.

Traditionally, this has relied on a combination of three cytogenetic technologies for structural variation analysis: karyotyping, FISH, and microarray, are used to detect copy number variants, translocations, inversions. Next generation sequencing is also applied for mutation analysis but has not been successful for structural variation analysis. These traditional methods have many very manual aspects and require extensive expertise. Optical genome mapping (OGM) consolidates assays into a single laboratory assay in which the output provides the visualization of structural and copy number variants at one time. OGM is able to comprehensively detect structural variations genome wide down to 5% variant allele fraction for CNVs, inversions, and translocations from blood and bone marrow aspirates making it an attractive choice for hematologic malignancy genomic analysis. Preanalytical and analytical steps require approximately 4-5 days from sample to processed data with structural variation calls. Dynamic filtering in the user interface can be configured to remove most polymorphic variants and prioritize relevant variants. In addition, the OGM graphical user interface software, Bionano Access 1.7, allows for the user to assign classification\/relevance to the variants for each case. For example, an ALL sample with t(9;22), deletion of <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, and whole chromosome gains of 4,6, and 10 can be easily visualized with the Circos plot and, then, can be further examined and annotated as needed. A second analyst can repeat the process blind to the first analysis and a supervisor can adjudicate the classifications. A variety of cases with hallmark abnormalities from various leukemias will be presented with the filtering and prioritization workflow used to derive them. This comprehensive technology allows for a quicker, more reliable output than traditional cytogenetic approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/77906b0e-e604-483d-9dad-a78a96544a34\/@C03B8ZHy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion genes,Copy number variation,Genomics,Chromosomal instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16467"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jennifer Hauenstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andy Pang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alka Chaubey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Alex Hastie<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is ubiquitously used because of the ease of use and the precision however, it does not offer high multiplexing. While digital PCR (dPCR) is known for increased precision and sensitivity, most digital PCR platforms provide the same level of multiplexing as qPCR. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is less precise than qPCR or dPCR and but has the highest multiplexing capability of the three technologies. Conventional digital PCR systems have been limited by the number of instruments required to conduct the workflow, time-to-result compared to qPCR, and level of multiplexing as compared to next-generation sequencing (NGS).<br \/>Crystal Digital PCR&#8482; and the naica system is a next-generation digital PCR platform that simplifies the number of instruments in the workflow, speeds up the time of results to less than 3 hours, and increases the number of detection colors to 6 spectrally distinct channels. By using a combination of dual-labelled fluorescent probes, multiplexed digital PCR provides a simple solution that makes it possible to use less of a precious sample when faced with limited quantity without sacrificing sensitivity.<br \/>The naica system workflow utilizes microfluidic consumables, such as the Sapphire chip for high sensitivity applications, and the Opal chip for higher throughput studies. All reagents including primers and probes, master mix, and sample are inputted into the chips in one single loading step. Chips are transferred to the Geode instrument, where the sample is partitioned into a 2D-monolayer of droplet crystals and where all targets are amplified. After the PCR program has been completed, the same chips are then loaded into the Prism6 imager which detects all targets across 6 fluorescent channels and outputs an image of all droplets in a sample. Finally, Crystal Miner analysis software can be used to analyze and decipher the quantifications and expression of all targets in the assay.<br \/>The 6-color naica system allows for high multiplex detection of targets previously unattainable by conventional digital PCR systems. With this advent, genomic scientists have an additional platform in the molecular toolbox that supports seamless assay development of oncology biomarker assays for gene expression, rare target detection, and liquid biopsy applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1952c74f-45a5-43c5-bba7-f055a34eed95\/@C03B8ZHy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Droplet digital PCR,Biomarkers,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16468"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew Hoskins<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shekerah Primus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Yazdani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberley Gutierrez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Foret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabien Bernard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rémi Dangla<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cell lines are extensively used to understand disease mechanisms, drug responses, drug metabolism, drug cytotoxicity, antibody production, vaccine development, gene function, generation of artificial tissues, synthesis of biological compounds, and develop transgenic preclinical models. However, the cells acquire additional genetic aberrations from the time the cell lines are established that might significantly impact the research for which the cell line is being used. The current methods to assess structural variants and copy number variants are limited in resolution (Karyotype), targeted (FISH), cannot detect balanced SVs (CMA), and cannot detect SVs in repetitive regions of the genome (NGS). Optical genome mapping (OGM) is an emerging next-generation cytogenenomics technology that can detect SVs including CNVs and complex rearrangements, using Saphyr platform that images ultra-long DNA molecules labelled at unique 6 base-pair motifs that span the entire genome, enabling genome-wide coverage and the ability to detect large SVs throughout the genome. In this study, we analyzed eight different cell lines that included seven cell lines of syndromes such as Fragile X (n=2), FSHD (n=2), DMD1 (n=1), Prader Willi (n=1), deafness (n=1), and one cell line for a transgenic mouse model. We have additionally analyzed 104 lymphoblast cell lines from the 1000 genomes project which do not have known clinical features. Briefly, ultra-high molecular weight DNA (150kb to &#62;1Mb) was isolated from cultured cells using ~1.5 million cells as per manufacturer&#8217;s protocol, uniformly labeled at a specific 6-base sequence motif, and loaded into a cartridge, where the molecules were electrophoretically linearized and imaged multiple times using the Bionano Genomics Saphyr&#174; platform. Using the captured images, a de novo genome map indicating the positions of the labels was constructed and compared to a reference genome to detect structural differences in the 2 maps. Chromosomal aberrations were detected by comparing optical maps to a reference and control dataset, and a coverage-based CNV calling was performed. In the present study, all eight cell lines were characterized with the concordance of reported genetic aberration in the syndromic cell lines. However, in the transgenic mouse cell line, several additional clinically pathogenic variants were detected in addition to the know variation. The study demonstrates the strength of OGM technology for detecting SVs and CNVs and its utility in the chromosomal characterization of cell lines that might significantly contribute towards accurate and reproducible research in a particular phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/88c73cf2-6d49-4631-8428-19b99176d1d5\/@C03B8ZHy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytogenetics,Cell lines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16469"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nikhil S.

There were significantly more PIK3CA adaptor binding domain mutations and PIK3CA\/PTEN co-mutations in endometrial cancer compared to other tumor types. Among PIK3CA\/PTEN co-mutations in endometrial cancer, there were significantly fewer TP53 mutations when compared to those with no PTEN co-mutation (17.2% vs. 70.7%; p&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusions: In endometrial cancer, PTEN is more frequently mutated upon PI3K\/AKT pathway hyperactivation, abrogating its normal inhibitory effect on PI3K resulting in increased cell proliferation and survival. When PTEN is not mutated, alternations downstream of AKT, such as TP53 mutations, may serve as alternative cell survival regulators. This may account for the relationship between PTEN\/PIK3CA KD co-mutation and TP53 mutation. While PIK3CA KD mutations are similarly predominant in breast and endometrial cancer, the PTEN feedback loop is disrupted in endometrial cancer. This study provides insight into the patterns of molecular alterations present within PIK3CA-mutated patients, which could be instrumental in stratifying patient populations.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{359C0854-7E63-41F5-9A05-29E7F176DBCE}\"><caption>PIK3CA Mutation Prevalence<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font: major-fareast;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\">Adapter binding domain&nbsp;<\/span><\/b><br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font: major-fareast;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\">Helical domain&nbsp;<\/span><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font: major-fareast;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\">Kinase domain<\/span><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font: major-fareast;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\">Hotspot H1047&nbsp;<\/span><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font: major-fareast;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\">PTEN co-mutation + any PIK3CA mutation<\/span><\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;line-height:150%\"><b><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast\">Endometrial<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/b><\/p>  <span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%;

The initial divergence in mortality curves between these groups occurred at the advent of hormone receptor (HR) targeted treatment options, unmasking the heterogeneity of BC diagnoses. Here, we present Whole Genomes Sequencing of 30 Triple Negative Breast Cancers of African women presenting to the clinics in New York. These were collected as part of the ICSBCS cohort to identify ancestry related mutational signatures including complex structural variants which could help better explain etiology of cancer in these population and that we may leveraged for treatment or prognostic purposes. Somatic mutational landscape included higher frequency of <i>TP53 <\/i>(73%), <i>BRCA1 <\/i>(40%), <i>ATK1 <\/i>(37%), <i>CDH1<\/i>(37%), and <i>CTCF <\/i>(33%). We confirmed African ancestry of patients through ADMIXTURE and observed (&#62;70%) African ancestry. Comparison between our cohort and TCGA BRCA showed higher tumor mutational burden in our cohort which could be accounted for by greater sensitivity in our updated sequencing technology and analysis pipelines.

Breast cancer subtypes, in particular basal-like breast cancer and the luminal breast cancer subtypes, differ by hormonal receptor status, proliferation, genomic instability and mutational signatures, treatment response, and prognosis. The highly distinct signatures of basal-like and luminal breast cancer suggest that they may have different cells of origin within the breast duct. As part of the Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Network (WU-HTAN) program, we generated multi-omic data for 53 samples from 37 breast cancer tumors and 4 normal adjacent tissues. Genomic subtyping was applied to both bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Analysis of single-nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility in epithelial cells underscores similarities between basal-like breast cancer and luminal progenitor cells within the breast duct, and between luminal breast cancer and mature luminal ductal cells. This study links distinct breast cancer subtypes to normal breast cell populations and suggests distinct cells of origin for these cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b3a241d5-cbed-4432-84e0-cb49207ce15d\/@C03B8ZHy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Cancer genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16472"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael D.

Similarly, SARS-Cov-2, the causal agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, also has an immune evasion function. This is mediated by ORF-8 through its interaction with multiple immune regulatory elements, including TGF-beta. This is a mutational analysis of ORF-8.<br \/>Methods: We took advantage of the database of millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes are archived and organized in phylogenetic relationships to show the evolution of ORF-8. Site numbering and genome structure use Wuhan-Hu-1\/2019 as reference. The phylogeny is rooted relative to early samples from Wuhan. Temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of 8 &#215; 10^-4 subs per site per year. ( https:\/\/nextstrain.org\/). The epidemiological data provided at https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/coronavirus was used to determine the property of the variants using mortality and infectivity data at the site.<br \/>Results: Scan of ORF-8 revealed a high rate of mutation at aa119 and aa120. More importantly, the mutation at 120 or 119 that resulted in null ORF8 clearly delineates the pre-Delta and Delta SARS-Cov-2. In fact, all the delta lineages exhibited the null mutation at 119\/120. This region is important for the dimerization of ORF-8 and possibly its interaction with host TGF-beta. All other variants, including the alpha variants, are wild type (aa120 = F). Monitoring the mutations over the last several months indicated that the delta variants have now picked up the wild type F at aa120 (Faa120) in Egypt or the L at aa 120 (Laa120) in India. The epidemiology of Egypt and India indicates that the Faa120 is more immune evasive and suggestive that more infectious but not more lethal.<br \/>Conclusions: This is an opportunity to monitor in real-time the evolution of ORF-8 and how it is interacting with the host immune system. Additionally, since our current clinical trial on TGF-beta inhibitors is in India and Latin America, it is an opportunity to correlate clinical findings to molecular and epidemiological data for these variants. If we are correct, the Faa120 will emerge as the dominant variant in the next wave of COVID-19.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/14947eba-6448-47c3-89b0-f0ad45b9006b\/@C03B8ZHy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TGF-&#946;,Immunosuppression,Immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16474"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Gopika Trieu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikita Mehta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Ionescu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lily Asgari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Vuong Trieu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, with complex workflows, long turnaround times, and numerous user touch points of most sequencing platforms does not make the process attainable. In contrast, the fully automated Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> system provides a specimen-to-report workflow for cancer research with minimal user touchpoints and single day turnaround time. FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded) tissues and liquid biopsy are two of the main sample types used in oncology research. Here we report the use of the Oncomine<sup>TM<\/sup> Precision Assay (OPA) with the Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> System which provides a comprehensive genetic profile across 50 key genes using DNA and RNA from FFPE tissues or cfTNA (cell free total nucleic acid) from liquid biopsy samples. To evaluate the nucleic acid (NA) extraction and sequencing performance of the Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> system, contrived control samples with known variants and clinical research samples were used in the OPA FFPE and liquid biopsy workflows (n = 30). NA was quantified using the Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> purification instrument&#8217;s onboard Qubit<sup>TM<\/sup> quantitation feature after purification. Output plates with extracted NA were transferred to the Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> Integrated Sequencer for library preparation and sequencing using the OPA assay. Data were analyzed using the Ion torrent Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> software to evaluate assay performance and variant calling.The OPA assay only requires 10ng of DNA and RNA from FFPE samples and 20ng of cfTNA from liquid biopsy samples. Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> purification instrument onboard quantitation data showed successful extraction of NA exceeding the required yields for library preparation. Excess NA was automatically aliquoted into an archive plate and stored for future use. Sequencing results for four samples of FFPE or liquid biopsy were reported within 24 hours. Both Control and clinical research samples showed expected assay metrices including read coverage, molecular coverage, and uniformity. The results reported all expected variants at correct allele frequencies, including <i>BRAF V600E<\/i>, <i>KRAS G12C<\/i>, <i>PIK3CA N345K<\/i>, <i>AKT1<\/i> etc. Overall, this study demonstrates that the Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> system provides a user-friendly workflow with automated NA purification, quantitation, sample dilution, library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis with minimal hands-on time that can be performed with limited expertise to obtain results within 24 hours. Reliable identification of variants from control and clinical research samples of FFPE and liquid biopsy origin with optimal assay metrics demonstrates the successful use of the OPA assay and Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> system that can be confidently used in clinical oncology research.(For Research Use Only.

Somatic hypermutation (SHM) status of the IGHV gene in CLL clinical research samples is important as SHM frequency is an established prognostic biomarker. Conventionally, SHM analysis is performed via Sanger sequencing which is limited by the inability to evaluate more than one rearrangement due to mutations, multiplex constraints, and template input requirements.<br \/>Ion AmpliSeq&#8482; next generation sequencing (NGS) assays for research in IGH chain SHM are evaluated using multiple cohorts of CLL research samples. These NGS assays employ multiplex primers that target the Leader or FR1 regions of the IGHV gene and the IGHJ gene in either RNA or DNA templates. The robustness of these assays was demonstrated by an evaluation across multiple labs, including comparisons between DNA and RNA input and correlation to orthogonal NGS testing.<br \/>Ion AmpliSeq&#8482; multiplex primer sets were designed to target the Leader or Framework 1 (FR1) regions of the IGHV gene with joining gene (J) or constant region (C) primers. The Oncomine&#8482; IGHV Leader-J Assay uses Leader primers, while the RNA-input Oncomine&#8482; IGH-LR Assay, and the DNA-input Oncomine&#8482; IGH FR1-J Assay use FR1 variable gene primers in combination with C and J region primers, respectively. Primer panels were designed to amplify all variable gene families, including all individual alleles, listed in the IMGT database. To evaluate accuracy, each assay was used to measure SHM from a panel of gDNA and RNA rearrangements extracted from CLL research samples for clonality testing and SHM analysis. To test the Leader-J and FR1-J DNA input assays, 24 orthogonally characterized CLL samples were evaluated on the Ion Torrent S5 platform. Stereotypy and confirmation of individual software findings assessed by placing FASTA file results into the online ARResT tool.<br \/>Both RNA and DNA input assays correctly determined the SHM status of CLL rearrangements, with IGHV SHM values concordant between both RNA and DNA approaches. SHM values derived from FR1 variable gene primers delivered concordant results compared to Leader variable gene primers across a range of SHM frequencies, with FR1 primer coverage of the IGHV gene leading to an expected over-estimation of SHM percentage. SHM status was concordant between NGS assays evaluated in over 90% (21\/24) of CLL samples tested. Mutational frequency showed excellent concordance, with an R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.97, and V-gene usage was 100% concordant.<br \/>These results support the robustness of long-read NGS assays to quantify SHM in either DNA or RNA samples. Concordant results were shown between FR1 and Leader-targeting primers using DNA input showing the utility in both priming locations. Orthogonal testing of the Leader-J assay showed excellent concordance for mutation rate, SHM status, and stereotypy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ce320fcc-fac3-4a5d-81c4-144d3693ddac\/@C03B8ZHy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),B cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16478"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michelle Toro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loni Pickle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shrutii Sarda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robyn Marshall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bonnie Pieterse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tania Venter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chenchen Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theo Gerdener<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geoffrey Marc Lowman<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here we describe a comprehensive genomic profiling pan-cancer assay that detects single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions\/deletions, somatic copy number alterations, translocations, RNA fusions and exon-skipping events, as well as determining Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) score and Microsatellite Instability (MSI) using both Tumor-only and Tumor-Normal analysis methods. The assay consists of hybrid capture-based panels for enrichment of both gDNA and total RNA extracted from FFPE samples. DNA and RNA samples are processed using Agilent&#8217;s SureSelect XT HS2 chemistry, including full automation on the Magnis NGS prep system, and analyzed using the Alissa Reporter software, streamlining the workflow and analysis.<br \/>Methods: Content of the assay was curated using literature review and input from multiple cancer databases. The assay employs a modular design with a DNA capture panel covering all actionable genes\/variants as well as genes that are commonly mutated across cancer types, and an RNA panel covering fusion driver mutations. Probes were designed to cover the exons of all genes with enhanced coverage of clinically actionable mutations. Selected genes in the DNA panel have additional coverage allowing for copy number determination and detection of translocations in hot-spot regions. The data analysis pipeline in the Alissa Reporter software allows for the seamless analysis of the sequencing results and provides sensitive and accurate detection of the variants. The software also allows for visualization in the genomic context, QC metrics tracking, and results reporting functionalities, giving users a full picture of their samples.<br \/>Results: Performance was demonstrated on &#62;80 FFPE samples and reference standards with accuracy determined by concordance with gold-standard measurements. For TMB analysis, FFPE samples were analyzed using the SureSelect Cancer CGP assay and whole-exome sequencing. The values from both assays show high correlation (r &#62; 0.8). Microsatellite instability measured by the assay was 93% concordant with MSI-PCR. ERBB2 copy number determination in breast cancer samples was 87% concordant with FISH, while translocation and RNA fusion detection were both &#62;85% concordant to FISH for a set of ALK+ NSCLC samples.<br \/>Conclusion: This work represents an important advancement in the development of an assay to detect the common mutation types found in cancer as well as provide information on the genomic biomarkers, TMB and MSI from a single FFPE sample.<br \/>For Research use Only","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/df835ebe-cc04-44f1-958f-41920179fb5e\/@D03B8ZHz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Tumor mutational burden,Microsatellite instability,Profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16479"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akanksha Khare<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Bergstrom Lucas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joachim De-Schrijver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manjula Aliminati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanjun Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linus Forsmark<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Novak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeroen Crappe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Ruvolo<\/i><\/presenter>.

There is a strong interest for researchers to reuse sample due to sample scarcity, as well as, to further characterize or validate their experimental findings. Historically, recovery of PCR products for downstream genomic testing applications has been challenging due to the stability of the sample post-reaction. Stilla Technologies has developed Crystal Digital PCR&#8482; and the naica&#174; system, a flexible and highplex droplet and imaging-based digital PCR platform that allows for multi-color detection of genetic targets with the ability to also recover samples after the reaction is performed.<br \/>This study shows how the 6-color naica digital PCR system workflow can be combined with a simple protocol for sample recovery. DNA contained in the recovered emulsion is extracted using a standard chloroform protocol that takes approximately 1 hour. DNA recovery rate assessment showed high percentage recovery of droplet sample and on average, 70% of the total DNA present from the initial sample recovered. Recovered DNA from the droplet crystal was sequenced and the results were confirmed by qPCR.<br \/>The droplet and sample recovery protocol post-digital PCR has potential applications to support validation of Crystal Digital PCR results, concordance alongside a multitude of genomic platforms, and further characterization of biomarkers and mutations with profiling platforms such as NGS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/54c625dc-33ae-451c-9ecb-3731b92aec22\/@D03B8ZHz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Droplet digital PCR,Genomics,Multiomics,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16480"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kimberley Gutierrez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Foret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cécile Jovelet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison C.

Separated single cells and nuclei demonstrate compatibility with the downstream single cell genomics platform.

The Oncomine<sup>TM<\/sup> Comprehensive Assay v3, a pan-cancer panel, used with the Ion Torrent<sup>TM<\/sup> Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> System allows for formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples to be examined across 161 unique genes in an automated sample to result workflow in 30hrs. This study demonstrates &#8805; 95% Sensitivity and PPV for detecting SNV, Indel, and Copy Number variants of clinical FFPE samples along with fusions. When tested using analytical controls, the Genexus System achieves &#8805; 98% Sensitivity for hotspot variants, &#8805; 95% for de novo variants, and 100% Sensitivity for fusion variants. The Ion Torrent<sup>TM<\/sup> Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> System is fully automated and consists of two software linked instruments, the Ion Torrent<sup>TM<\/sup> Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> Purification System and the Ion Torrent<sup>TM<\/sup> Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> Integrated Sequencer. For this study, the purification system was used to sequentially extract and quantify DNA &#38; RNA samples from human colon and lung FFPE tumor tissue. The purification instrument provides minimal hands-on-time, ease of use and compatibility with the integrated sequencer. It extracts and quantifies the nucleic acids, records the quantitation values and transfers the nucleic acids to an output plate. The plate is transferred from the purification instrument directly to the sequencer for sample dilution, library preparation, and sequencing using the Oncomine<sup>TM<\/sup> Comprehensive Assay v3 panel. Variant calling analysis of the DNA &#38; RNA pairs is completed immediately following sequencing. Results show that the variants are detected reproducibly with &#8805; 95% Sensitivity and PPV when compared to the Ion GeneStudio<sup>TM<\/sup> S5 System as an orthogonal method. All variants in the report were correct with p-values &#8804; 10-5. Additionally, a subset of the extracted samples was evaluated using Sanger Sequencing to verify hotspot mutations found in samples sequenced on both the Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> System and GeneStudio<sup>TM<\/sup> S5 System. Results show that all expected hotspot variants were detected. In summary, the Ion Torrent<sup>TM<\/sup> Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> System is a reliable and fast turnaround solution for sample-to-variant calling results.

TNBC is characterized by many large copy number variants that result in the deletion and amplifications of many genes, with TP53 being the only common oncogenic driver. Using TCGA data and in-depth functional genomic analysis of TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX), our group showed that chr4p is a recurrently deleted region in basal breast cancer, which TNBC is an enriched subtype. This correlated with poor prognosis and a highly proliferative state. Here, we set out to survey the tumor suppressive genetic network underlying the TNBC-specific chr4pdeletion. Using an arrayed CRISPR-enCas12 screening approach, I will generate a panel of mutant cell lines deleted for all protein-coding genes residing within chr4p. MCF10A series of cell lines will be used for mutant cell line construction, because it is an established normal human breast epithelial model system with a normal karyotype to ensure the diploid state ofchr4p and includes other derivatives (MCF10A(-E7-Bcl2)) that show basal anchorage independent growth in 3D to assess cell transformation. The resulting panel of single gene deletion mutant cell lines will be characterized for their effects on proliferation, apoptosis, cell transformation and senescence. Additionally, the tumor suppressive genetic interaction network of chr4p will be mapped using a multiplexed CRISPR-enCas12 screening methodology. A dual guide-RNA library will be generated for all protein-coding genes to test all pairwise combinations for tumor suppressive genetic interactions. The proliferation due to double gene deletions will be monitored and compared to single gene deletions to identify tumor suppressive interactions. This study will be the first to systematically identify tumor suppressor genetic network underlying chr4p. Ultimately, it will provide an in-depth understanding of the genetic network of large copy number variants in TNBC and insight into new avenues for precision oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f8cabf2-c43e-4234-94bd-26904fb3693f\/@D03B8ZHz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tumor suppressor,Tumor evolution,Phenotype,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16486"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joseph Del Corpo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rohan Dandage<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lea Harrington<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Kuzmin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Unlike other methods, cell separation via magnetic levitation does not require dyes, antibodies or specific markers, and the cells are not modified or perturbed in any fashion. However, magnetic levitation also does not preclude the use of these tools to further enhance separation of cells. In its simplest form, magnetic levitation requires only the addition of an inert paramagnetic compound to the media in which the cells are suspended. The cells are subsequently introduced into an externally applied magnetic field while contained within a single-use cartridge, which causes the cells to levitate in solution. The cells&#8217; intrinsic properties, including density and magnetic susceptibility, determine the height to which the cells levitate. As different cell types often have different such properties, they may often levitate to different heights, facilitating their separation. Continuous imaging allows for complete sample analysis and characterization with the benefit of real-time control over the cell separation. The simplicity of magnetic levitation enables cells to be treated gently without use of high pressure or other perturbations that commonly lead to increased cellular stress responses, specific cell type activation, or even cell death. The direct and gentle flow path leads to high yields of live cells even with very low input cell numbers.<br \/>This novel cell separation technology enables a variety of applications, including: the enrichment of viable cells from dead\/dying cells and debris; separation of different cell types possessing distinct densities; and, in cases where the intrinsic density changes, the separation of differentiated from undifferentiated cells. Given that the levitation chamber is flanked by two magnets on the top and bottom, the levitation technology also inherently allows for the use of magnetic particles to deplete undesired cells within a cell population. Here we illustrate the performance of anti-CD45 antibody-conjugated magnetic particles for CD45+ cell depletion with the LeviCell system. CD45+ depletion rates of greater than 99% are readily obtained across a wide range of total CD45+ input cell numbers, from 10<sup>5<\/sup> to 10<sup>7<\/sup> total cells. Furthermore, CD45+ cell depletion is performed simultaneously with live cell enrichment, allowing for the collection of a high viability CD45- live cell population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4ad1e6bb-2362-44bf-aca6-1beb1fda26b8\/@D03B8ZHz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Immune cells,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16487"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kevin Travers<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Stevens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susana Jett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne Weaver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teddy De Groot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Ha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geoff Facer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathy Lazaruk<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although the repertoire of clonal somatic genetic alterations in primary and metastatic breast cancers has been characterized, a complete characterization of the subclonal genetic alterations present in these cancers, as well as their clonal composition and clonal dynamics remain to be fully defined. Addressing these knowledge gaps is germane to the successful personalization of treatments for breast cancer patients. Single cell sequencing is uncovering many insights into the clonal evolution and heterogeneity of breast cancers and how this can be leveraged for clinical and therapeutic benefit. Bulk next generation sequencing has primarily focused on mutation profiling; however, there are several lines of evidence to demonstrate the biological and clinical importance of accurately detecting copy number alterations. Previous single cell sequencing studies focusing on copy number alterations were based on whole-genome amplification methods or could not concurrently define the repertoire of somatic mutations and copy number alterations in single cells. Here we report on a novel single cell DNA sequencing approach leveraging the Tapestri device and Insights bioinformatic pipeline to detect both copy number alterations and somatic mutations in individual cells derived from breast cancer specimens. The identification of targeted somatic genetic alterations at single cell resolution provides novel insights about the development, progression and therapeutic resistance of breast cancers, and enables the development of novel diagnostic tools and predictive biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b783ec98-6225-4b76-b270-970fa487f989\/@D03B8ZHz\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Copy number variation,Single cell,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16488"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Saurabh Parikh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arnaud Da Cruz Paula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shirin Issa Bhaloo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Britta Weigelt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khushali Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ania Wronski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anup Parikh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khushali Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge Reis-Filho<\/i><\/presenter>.

A lung and bronchus subtype, NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer), accounts for over 75% of new lung cancer diagnoses of which lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common. Here, we studied the role of microRNAs and the transcriptome expression profile in LUAD prognosis, progression, and overall patient survival. We analyzed RNA-sequence data from a cohort of LUAD patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The correlations of microRNA gene expression to transcription networks identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were further explored in an upstream regulator\/signaling pathway analysis, gene ontology (GO) process enrichment, and differential expression analysis. Mature microRNA abundance was also integrated with the mRNA network via correlation analysis. Our analysis revealed 18 clusters (modules) of highly correlated gene transcripts. The turquoise and red modules were of particular interest, as they were correlated negatively with overall survival, positively with stage 1 status, and negatively to later pathologic stages (3-4). Additionally, high select miRNA correlation to the red module transcripts (e.g., <i>C16Orf89<\/i>, <i>ADGRF5<\/i>, <i>CFAP221<\/i>, and <i>SELENBP1<\/i>; all with module eigengene correlation rho &#8805; 0.75), and to the turquoise module (e.g., <i>DDX39B<\/i> and <i>LENG8<\/i>; each with rho &#8805; 0.85) suggests these are miRNA-mRNA coregulatory networks of which both the gene products and potentially upstream miRNAs may serve as promising mechanistic targets and prognostic markers for LUAD, meriting further study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d191af4b-7311-4d9e-b018-cf496df419bf\/@D03B8ZHz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),MicroRNA,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16489"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Corey D.
