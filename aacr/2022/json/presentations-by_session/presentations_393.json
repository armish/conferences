[{"Abstract":"Tumor metastasis remains one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths in patients with solid tumors. Mechanisms by which metabolic alterations regarding pro-survival lipid signaling activation in inducing cancer cell migration and metastasis are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) metabolism activates endogenous complement signaling for inducing tumor metastasis via inducing inflammasome-mediated pro-inflammation. Our studies using molecular, pharmacologic, and genetic tools showed that activation of S1P and S1P receptor 1 (S1P\/S1PR1) induces tumor metastasis via enhanced intracellular complement signaling by the regulation of the C3-PPIL1 complex and subsequent inflammasome activation in cancer cells and <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft-derived tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7a28ea6b-54c8-4c22-964e-737f87ec78a6\/@G03B8ZGR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipid metabolism,Cancer cell,Inflammation,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14614"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alhaji H.

Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is a master regulator of centriole replication and its overexpression has been identified in non-melanoma skin cancers. The aberrant proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes provoked by interleukin-17 (IL-17) leads to psoriasis. Thus, targeting centriole replication and IL-17 signaling simultaneously has been speculated as a potential therapeutic strategy. We hypothesized that inhibition of centriole duplication might enhance the blockade of epidermal proliferation through <i>Il-17rc<\/i> knockout.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To investigate cooperation between IL-17 signaling and centriole duplication in the proliferation of epidermis, we used 37 mice to establish a two-stage model of skin carcinogenesis and 69 mice to establish imiquimod-induced psoriasis model in wild-type (WT), IL-17 receptor A (T779A) knock-in (<i>Il-17ra<\/i>(T779A)-KI) and IL-17 receptor C knock-out (<i>Il-17rc<\/i>-KO) C57BL\/6J mouse strains.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> During our 13-week monitor of the two-stage skin carcinogenesis model, we found that <i>Il-17ra<\/i>(T779A)-KI mice showed significantly decreased tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity, and tumor volume, compared to the wild-type mice.<i> Il-17rc<\/i>-KO mice didn&#8217;t develop any skin papilloma. The skin papilloma formed never progressed into squamous carcinoma based on our immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of laminin and cytokeratin 8. However, centrinone, a selective inhibitor of PLK4, didn&#8217;t affect skin papilloma formation or epidermal thickening. In our psoriasis model, we found that the thickness of the epidermis of <i>Il-17rc<\/i>-KO mice was dramatically decreased, compared to WT and <i>Il-17ra<\/i>(T779A)-KI mice. There was no significant difference between WT and <i>Il-17ra<\/i>(T779A)-KI mice, in terms of psoriasis formation and the thickness of the epidermis. Centrinone didn&#8217;t stall the thickening of the epidermis in the psoriasis model. IHC staining showed significantly increased Ki-67<sup>+<\/sup> basal keratinocytes in the untreated skin of <i>Il-17ra<\/i>(T779A)-KI male mice, but not in female mice, compared to WT mice. In imiquimod-treated skin, the percentage of Ki-67<sup>+<\/sup> basal keratinocytes significantly decreased in <i>Il-17ra<\/i>(T779A)-KI mice, compared to WT mice. The percentage of Ki-67<sup>+<\/sup> basal keratinocytes was also dramatically decreased in <i>Il-17rc<\/i>-KO mice, compared to WT and <i>Il-17ra<\/i>(T779A)-KI mice.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our findings suggest that the proliferation of keratinocytes is not stalled by PLK4 inhibitor centrinone but is inhibited by <i>Il-17rc<\/i>-KO. <i>Il-17ra<\/i>(T779A)-KI significantly inhibits skin papilloma formation, but only slightly decreases epidermal thickening in the psoriasis model.

Although TRAIL biology has garnered considerable attention as a potential anti-cancer strategy, TRAIL agonists have had very limited anti-cancer activity in humans. TRAIL signaling can attenuate the T lymphocyte response. However, this potential immunosuppressive function of TRAIL has not been examined in cancer biology. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a highly lethal biliary tract cancer, has a dense immunosuppressive microenvironment. Accordingly, CCA provides a model to examine the potential immune regulatory function of TRAIL in cancer biology.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Using a syngeneic, orthotopic murine model of CCA (PMID: 29464042), murine CCA cells (SB cells) that express both <i>Trail<\/i> and <i>Trail<\/i> receptor (<i>Tr<\/i>) were implanted into livers of WT and<i> Tr<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mice. Hence, in this model the host immune cells express <i>Trail<\/i> but not the receptor; therefore, they would be capable of inducing TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in CCA cells but would be resistant to TRAIL-mediated immunosuppression. After 4 weeks of tumor growth, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were characterized using flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We observed that <i>Tr<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice had a significant reduction in tumor burden compared to WT mice. Moreover, tumor bearing <i>Tr<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice had a significant increase in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and enhanced CTL effector function. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were significantly decreased in<i> Tr<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> tumors compared to WT tumors. Furthermore, implantation of SB cells devoid of <i>Trail<\/i> (SB-<i>Trail<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) <\/i>into WT mice resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden and MDSC infiltration. In vitro functional studies employing SB cells deficient in <i>Tr<\/i> (SB-<i>Tr<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>) and MDSCs were carried out. There was a significant reduction in proliferation and immunosuppressive function of MDSCs when cocultured with SB-<i>Tr<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>compared to SB cells. These results indicate that TRAIL-TR fosters MDSC growth and immunosuppressive function.<br \/><b>In conclusion,<\/b> we have demonstrated that <i>Tr<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice have a significant reduction in CCA tumor burden and MDSC infiltration. Consequently, <i>Tr<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> tumors have enhanced CTL infiltration and function. These data suggest that the TRAIL-TR system<br \/>mediates tumors immune evasion via MDSCs, and direct targeting of TRAIL on CCA cells is a potential anti-tumor strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/041d90d2-08ae-4aaa-8c5d-a949bfec94a3\/@G03B8ZGR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Myeloid cells,Death receptors,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14618"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emilien Loeuillard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingchun Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haidong Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory J.

THP has a role in antibacterial host defense but also in inflammatory disorders of the urogenital tract. THP has been shown to regulate the innate and adaptive immunity in the urinary tract by potently activating macrophages and dendritic cells. Given these immunostimulatory effects, we hypothesize that systemic THP administration can promote an antitumor and antimetastatic response. THP was isolated from human urine of healthy individuals at a purity of &#62;99% with less than &#60; 1 UE\/mg de THP of endotoxin. We treated murine J744 macrophages and human monocytes with 10 and 100 &#181;g\/ml THP for 18h and TNF&#945; levels were determined by ELISA. In J744 macrophages TNF&#945; levels reached 0.9 and 1.4 ng\/ml, respectively and in human monocytes 4.5 and 6 ng\/ml, respectively, confirming the macrophage-stimulating properties of THP. We then evaluated proliferation and migration by cell count and wound healing, respectively, in the 4T1 murine triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model and the MDA-MB-231 human TNBC model. We cultured 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells for 4 days with 100 &#181;g\/ml THP and observed an inhibition in proliferation of 62% and 40%, respectively. Cell migration was evaluated under treatment with 100 &#181;g\/ml THP for 18h. Migration was inhibited by 70% in 4T1 cells and by 30% in MDA-MB-231 cells. These data highlight the antitumoral and antimetastatic effect of THP in TNBC. The <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments were performed by administering THP 3 times a week and\/or docetaxel (Dx) at 15 mg\/kg twice a week in BALB\/c mice bearing 4T1 tumors (50-75 mm<sup>2<\/sup>), and tumor growth, lung metastasis and survival were determined. A dose-response curve (0.3-3 mg\/kg) was performed using THP administered either s.c. or i.p. THP s.c. at 1.5 &#181;g \/kg and THP i.p. at 3 &#181;g\/kg induced 40% and 38% tumor growth inhibition, respectively. THP also reduced metastasis measured as the number of lung nodules, and the addition of Dx deepened the effect even more. In the case of survival studies, the tumors were surgically removed after reaching 50 mm<sup>3<\/sup> and two days later the animals were treated with vehicle, Dx, or Dx+THP. Log rank analysis of Kaplan-Meier plots showed a significant improvement of overall survival in mice treated with Dx+THP (P= 0.011) and only a trend with Dx treatment (P=0.067). Here we show that THP decreases TNBC proliferation, reduces metastasis dissemination and improves Dx's effect. These evidences are especially important in TNBC whose standard of care is only chemotherapy. In conclusion, THP can be a valuable agent to enhance the use of Dx in the chemotherapy treatment of TNBC tumors. However, beneficial effects over other tumors should be confirmed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9f310b59-4f07-40c0-b5ec-f0093f6e382b\/@G03B8ZGR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastasis,Tumor growth,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14619"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>María Florencia Mercogliano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofia Bruni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mara De Martino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Cavanagh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liliana Balanian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilio Sojo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felipe Inserra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Groisman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roxana Schillaci<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although dysregulated PAX8 expression has recently been shown to promote the growth of ovarian and renal cancers, its role in uterine cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that overexpression of PAX8 promotes uterine cancer growth and metastasis. When 108 uterine cancer specimens were evaluated by mass spectroscopy, the highest levels of PAX8 were found in TP53-mutated, copy number (CN)-high specimens. In vitro, we found that targeting PAX8 expression resulted in decreased rates of both proliferation and apoptosis in multiple representative cell lines (ARK2 and ARK4). PAX8 knockdown also negatively impacted rates of in vitro migration and invasion assessed using commercially available Boyden chamber assays. Using whole-exome and transcriptomic profiling performed by Next Generation Sequencing, we found that PAX8 knockdown resulted in increased expression of 268 gene products by &#62;1.5-fold, and decreased expression of 179 gene products (adj p&#60;0.01; FDR&#60;1%). Specific gene products whose expression was altered by targeting PAX8 expression included IL-1&#946;, IL-11, and MUC1. With qPCR, we confirmed that levels of IL-1&#946; were 13.8-fold and 3.4-fold higher in cultures of ARK2 and ARK4 cells transfected with PAX8-specific siRNA, respectively, when compared to cultures transfected with a nontargeting control (p&#60;0.01). Using these transfections, we also confirmed increased expression of IL-11 in ARK2 cells (RQ=3.22, p&#60;0.01) and ARK4 cells (RQ = 2.28, p&#60;0.01), and increased expression of MUC1 in ARK2 cells (RQ=1.13, p&#60;0.01). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PAX8 regulates the proliferation of CN-high uterine cancers, potentially through the regulation of IL-1&#946; expression. Notably, our data also implicates PAX8 expression as a key mediator of the inflammatory response to these aggressive cancers. Key differences in PAX8&#8217;s relationship with proliferation and these select few signaling molecules, compared to what is seen in other PAX8-dependent cancers, suggest unique roles for PAX8 as an oncogene in uterine cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/901ccde1-6e15-4e95-8d39-242114ba8a3c\/@G03B8ZGR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Proliferation,Cytokines,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14620"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lauren Karnolt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maja Okuka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Read<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongchao Dou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas J.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major upstream pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by malignant or microenvironmental cells that supports pancreatic tumorigenesis, invasiveness, and tumor heterogeneity. Previously, our laboratory has established that dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), one of seven NADPH oxidase (NOX) family members, plays a critical role in H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>-mediated host defense and chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. DUOX2 is upregulated and expressed along with its maturation factor, DUOXA2, in several human pancreatic cancer cell lines following exposure to various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-&#947;, IL-4, and IL-17A. Using a panel of PDAC cells lines, we report the induction of DUOX2\/DUOXA2 mRNA and protein expression by both IL-1&#945; and IL-1&#223;, two major agonists of IL-1. In BxPC-3, CFPAC-1 and Hs 766T (HTB-134) cells, prolonged treatment with IL-1&#945; or IL-1&#223; results in transient activation of STAT1 and NF-kB signaling followed by prolonged induction of DUOX2\/DUOXA2 mRNA and protein expression. Stimulation by IL-1&#945; or IL-1&#223; results in a specific increase in the expression of DUOX2\/DUOXA2; increased expression of other NOX family members was not observed. Activation of canonical IL-1 signaling in our PDAC cell lines was supported by the observation of IL-1-related upregulation of IL-8 (CXCL8) mRNA, a chemokine essential for neutrophil recruitment and a potent promoter of angiogenesis, in IL-1-treated PDAC cells. Moreover, when the anti-inflammatory compound anakinra (an IL-1R antagonist) was co-administered <i>in vitro <\/i>with IL-1, cytokine-induced DUOX2\/DUOXA2 and CXCL8 induction was significantly suppressed. Finally, xenografts established with BxPC-3 cells demonstrated slower growth and significant downregulation of IL-1&#223; and DUOX2 when the immunosuppressive corticosteroid dexamethasone was administered. Given our previous findings that DUOX2 is highly expressed in the pancreas during episodes of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, and contributes significantly to extracellular ROS formation, these studies suggest that IL-1 may play a role in promoting inflammation and tumorigenesis in pancreatic malignancies through upregulation of DUOX2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd2405e6-4db4-4f20-94d7-75aad61a41a6\/@H03B8ZGS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Reactive oxygen species,Interleukin-1,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14621"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David J.

Complement activation has been linked to the promotion of tumor growth and metastasis across various anatomical sites with context-dependent effects. We therefore aim to understand the role for complement activation in pancreatic cancer. We have generated a tamoxifen-inducible autochthonous mouse model of PDAC which recapitulates genetic mutations found in humans using <i>LSL-Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>; Tgfbr2<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>; Ptf1a-CreER<\/i> (KTC) mice. Using these mice, we assessed for complement activation in pancreatic tumors by western blot and confocal immunofluorescence. Western blotting for neoepitopes generated upon cleavage of Complement Component 3 (C3) demonstrated significantly increased complement activation in KTC tumors when compared to normal pancreas from at least 4-7 months post-induction. Using confocal immunofluorescence, we observed deposition of complement fragments in tumor stroma and on ductal carcinoma cells identified by co-staining with cytokeratin 19. We therefore hypothesized complement blockade would reduce PDAC tumor growth and sought to test this using C3 knockout (C3 KO) mice which lack all downstream complement function due to the central role of C3. We assessed flank tumor growth using two <i>Kras; Tp53<\/i> (KPC) mutant-derived tumor cell lines in wild type (WT) C57BL\/6J and C3 KO mice yet did not find a biologically significant reduction in flank tumor growth between WT and C3 KO. To validate the knockout, we assessed C3 activation by western blot but surprisingly found increased complement activation in C3 KO tumors. RT-qPCR demonstrated local transcription of C3 mRNA in both WT and C3 KO tumors as well as transcription of C3 mRNA in KPC cells in culture. This demonstrates that KPC cells are capable of autocrine production of C3. Using immunocytochemistry and RT-qPCR we identified expression of the C3a receptor in KPC cells which we hypothesized could serve as a sensor for feedback to control local C3 production. We applied 10 nM recombinant C3a to KPCY cells in vitro and found a 20% reduction in C3 mRNA transcription 1-hour post-treatment. Pre-treatment with 500 nM C3aR Antagonist (SB290157) ablated this effect. In summary, complement activation is significantly increased in PDAC and appears to be activated in part by tumor cells themselves. Autocrine production of C3 by tumor cells is sufficient to produce complement activation in the absence of systemic C3. Additional experiments are warranted to determine the role of complement in PDAC using C3 mice crossed with KTC mice to assess tumorigenesis in the total absence of C3.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6d07e882-e8df-40b3-ba16-a51224b0282d\/@H03B8ZGS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14622"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brett I.

Using a gene expression signature based on differential gene expression analysis in the 113 subjects with and without disease control with ICI treatment, we performed unsupervised clustering of the larger 379 subject cohort and identified a responder (R) cluster and non-responder (NR) cluster. The R cluster was associated with high PD-L1 expression, T-cell infiltration, and <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations. The NR cluster was associated with negative PD-L1 expression, lack of T-cell infiltration, and mutations in <i>STK11<\/i>, <i>APC<\/i>\/<i>CTNNB1<\/i>, and <i>NFE2L2<\/i>. Of the mutation subsets, <i>STK11<\/i> was most associated with NR with a trend towards lower PD-L1 expression by clinical IHC, but much more significantly associated by gene expression signatures with low PD-L1 and T-cell inflammation. In our gene panel, we identified elevated <i>TRIM29<\/i> expression in <i>STK11<\/i> mutant NSCLC tumors and confirmed TRIM29 expression by IHC on a separate 64 subject cohort with known <i>STK11<\/i> mutation status and archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. A subset of <i>STK11<\/i> mutant NSCLC cell lines also demonstrated elevated TRIM29 expression and we generated knockouts of TRIM29 with CRISPR-Cas9 in these cell lines which resulted in decreased tumor growth in xenograft models.

Obesity (BMI &#62; 30 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) promotes breast cancer incidence, progression, and mortality in women of all ages. The prevalence of obesity in the US has increased dramatically over recent decades and continues to rise. Although obesity is associated with increased adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic dysfunction the exact mechanisms regulating obesity-exacerbated tumor growth are relatively unknown. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like sulindac, inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 and modulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of sulindac in our E0771 mouse model of obesity and mammary tumor growth.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>C57BL\/6J mice were fed either a high-fat diet (n=16) or a low-fat control diet (n=12) for 15 weeks. Half of the control (n=6) and DIO (n=8) mice were then treated with 140 ppm sulindac in their respective diets for 4 weeks prior to orthotopic injection of 20,000 E0771 cells. Tumors were harvested and weighed, and serum was collected 4 weeks following injection. Bulk transcriptional profile analysis was performed on E0771 tumors from untreated control and DIO mice relative to sulindac-treated control and DIO mice using Affymetrix microarrays followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify significantly enriched gene sets. Serum cytokine levels were measured in all mice using the Bio-Plex Pro mouse chemokine panel 33-plex; multiple linear regression was conducted to determine cytokines associated with mammary tumor size, independent of diet or treatment group assignment.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>DIO mice had increased tumor weight relative to control mice, while sulindac decreased tumor weight in DIO but not control mice. GSEA analysis revealed only one gene set upregulated in the DIO tumors relative to control or DIO sulindac tumors. Immune-related gene sets were commonly enriched in tumors from control and DIO sulindac relative to DIO mice, suggesting that sulindac restored immune signaling in tumors from DIO mice. Leading edge analysis of the significantly enriched gene sets showed that: 1) the reversal of DIO-mediated immunosuppression by sulindac occurred via principally overlapping genes; and 2) cytokine and immune genes predominate the transcriptional effects of sulindac treatment in DIO mice. Sulindac also modified circulating serum cytokine levels, but multiple linear regression showed that cytokine levels were not independently predictive of tumor weight in our study.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The study suggests that sulindac can reverse transcriptional changes in mammary tumors from obese mice and restore immunosurveillance.

However, patient mortality drastically declines as the tumor begins to invade other tissues and metastasize, making aggressive phenotypes especially problematic to treat. Such treatment typically requires an aggressive and decisive multidisciplinary approach. The recent expansion of immunotherapy as a viable treatment option has greatly improved treatment outcomes, especially with aggressive breast cancer phenotypes. Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is a DNA salvage pathway enzyme that is highly expressed during S phase and involved in cell cycle repair. Past studies indicated that TK1 is secreted into the serum of cancer patients and that its upregulation is an early event in tumorigenesis, thus suggesting that TK1 upregulation may have potential importance in tumor progression. This study&#8217;s objective was to further elucidate TK1&#8217;s role in tumor progression and metastasis of breast cancer specifically. We hypothesized that TK1 overexpression in breast cancer may affect invasion. To investigate this, TK1 mRNA transcript levels were analyzed between normal and BRCA patient tissue samples. The wild-type breast cancer cell line HCC 1806 was used, as well as a TK1 knockdown (L133) which was produced using CRISPR-Cas9. Successful TK1 knockdown was verified through western blot and qPCR. Bioinformatics was also performed to analyze the relationship between our breast cancer cell lines and various cell adhesion factors. The cell lines HCC 1806 and L133 were then tested with an invasive scratch assay. Additional western blots were run to further investigate the potential relationship TK1 may have with other cell cycle checkpoint proteins. Results showed that TK1 mRNA transcript levels are higher in BRCA tissues compared to normal controls. Western blot and qPCR indicated that TK1 was successfully knocked down in L133 cells. Bioinformatic differential gene analysis revealed several correlations with cell adhesion factors, with contrasting correlations when compared between the HCC 1806 and L133 cell lines. The invasive scratch assay results indicated that the TK1 knockdown L133 cells were less invasive than HCC 1806 cells. In conclusion, results verified that TK1 is highly expressed in breast cancer and that it may help tumor invasion by influencing cell adhesion factors. Further investigation to understand TK1&#8217;s potential interactions with important cell adhesion factors, such as FHL1 or GAS6, may help elucidate other therapeutic targets for preventing disease progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f03b79b8-0984-45e3-9e1a-0ea5f35db085\/@H03B8ZGS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thymidine kinase,Invasion,Adhesion,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14625"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Eliza E.

In many solid tumors they have been linked with improved survival, but their prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains uncertain. In immunotherapy-na&#239;ve patients with HCC, peritumoral and intratumoral TLS have been associated with improved overall survival, but TLS and increased expression of an associated 12-chemokine gene signature in tumor-adjacent liver parenchyma have also been linked to worse outcomes. In patients with HCC receiving immunotherapy, the prognostic value of TLS and the 12-chemokine signature is not known.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We collected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors of 12 patients with locally advanced HCC treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab and cabozantinib followed by surgical resection. We used immunohistochemistry and imaging mass cytometry to determine TLS density and immunophenotype. We obtained bulk RNA sequencing from 9 patients (4 responders and 5 non-responders) and used hierarchical clustering to define subgroups of patients according to expression of a previously validated 12-chemokine gene signature. The prognostic value of the chemokine signature for predicting disease free survival (DFS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed by log-rank test. Additional analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of the 12-chemokine signature was performed using spatial transcriptomics.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Increased TLS density was associated with a major pathologic response to treatment (p = 0.006). Hierarchical clustering of expression of the 12-chemokine gene signature identified increased expression in 4 responders and 1 non-responder and decreased expression in 4 non-responders. The association between chemokine expression and pathologic response to treatment was statistically significant by Fisher&#8217;s exact test (p = 0.008). Patients with increased expression of the 12-chemokine signature showed a trend toward improved DFS (HR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.05). Spatial transcriptomics showed heterogeneous chemokine expression across the resection specimen which was highest in immune clusters.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Using immunohistochemistry, bulk RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics, we show that TLS and a TLS-associated 12-chemokine gene signature are associated with a favorable response to treatment in patients receiving neoadjuvant nivolumab and cabozantinib for HCC. We found a trend toward improved DFS in patients with increased expression of the 12-chemokine signature, a finding which should be evaluated in a larger cohort.

Recent work has also suggested IL-36 cytokines may act as a potential adjuvant in immunotherapy regimens to augment the anti-cancer immune response. Given the pluripotent nature of IL-1 cytokines and the relationship between inflammation and tumorigenesis, we investigated the effects of IL-36 signalling in colorectal cancer (CRC).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> IL-36 family expression in CRC progression was investigated by the NCBI GEO transcriptomic database, and then by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qRT-PCR. Pro-tumorigenic properties such as cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation were investigated in 2D and 3D models. <i>In vivo<\/i> models were performed using Balb-c mice which were subcutaneously inoculated with CT26 cells and treated with IP injections of recombinant IL-36R agonists (IL-36&#945;, &#946;, &#947;) or antagonist (IL-36RN). Tumour tissues were excised and studied by flow cytometry and IHC analysis. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated IL-36R KO CT26 cells were generated and subcutaneously injected into Balb-c mice, with changes in tumour growth and immune cell infiltrate investigated.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> IL-36R expression was shown to significantly increase with stage of disease in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, including distant metastases. Additionally, expression of all family members was increased in tumour tissue relative to adjacent normal tissue in a separate colon cancer cohort. <i>In vitro<\/i> IL-36R signalling on cancer cells augmented a pro-tumorigenic phenotype by induction of pro-tumorigenic cytokines\/chemokine production, increased cellular migration, invasion and proliferation of tumour cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> inhibition of IL-36R signalling by both administration of recombinant IL-36RN and through deletion of the IL-36R gene in CT26 cells, resulted in a significant reduction in tumour growth. This reduction was associated with a significant decrease in tumour cell proliferation, as well as an increase in CD8+ T cell infiltrate in IL-36R KO groups. Of note, administration of IL-36R agonists also resulted in reduced tumour growth, albeit to a lesser extent, associated with an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This data indicates that IL-36 family members, similar to other IL-1 family members, have dual functions in colon cancer. In addition, this data suggests that targeting IL-36R signalling may be a useful targeted therapy for CRC patients with IL-36R+ tumour cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dc80f08d-47e9-4483-b42c-b8c571a8a341\/@H03B8ZGS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Proliferation,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14627"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kevin J.

NHP spontaneously develop cancers with progression patterns, histology, and clinical symptoms similar to humans. Gene suppression by DNA hypermethylation in the promoter region is the major characteristics of the CpG-island-methylator-phenotype (CIMP) described in human CRC patients but information in rhesus macaques is scarce. To further validate these animals as translational models for CIT, we conducted a deep molecular characterization of NHP colorectal cancers and established novel qPCR panels to assess DNA methylation of marker genes published for humans.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Our cohort (n=16) consisted of Indian-origin rhesus macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta<\/i>) with naturally occurring CRC (n=16, female=11). Clinical examination, imaging (contrast-enhanced CT, FDG-PET) and biopsy to confirm cancer histology were performed. Molecular characterization was done by IHC for CRC-associated mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 and by PCR\/electrophoresis for microsatellite instability. Ultimately, we designed DNA methylation- and rhesus-specific qPCR probes (Methylight) targeting corresponding regions as published in human patients, including CACNA1G, CDKN2A, CRABP1, MLH1, and NEUROG1 as parts of the CIMP panel and BMP3, NDRG4, and SEPTIN9 as probed for human CRC-screening.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> MLH1 deficiency by IHC, in conjunction with PMS2 absence, is observed in all NHP CRC cases, clearly exceeding frequencies reported in human CRCs (ranging from 2-15%). Moreover, we have documented microsatellite instable cases in some NHP CRCs, analog to human CRCs. DNA methylation of the MLH1 promoter region was significantly elevated in CRCs (100% of CRCs &#62;2-fold, p&#60;0.0001) compared to healthy colon. We hypothesized that this elevation would suppress MLH1 mRNA expression. This hypothesis of epigenetic suppression is corroborated by both qPCR and RNA sequencing which demonstrate significantly downregulated levels of MLH1 mRNA. DNA methylation of the other markers is less consistent but revealed CIMP positive and CIMP negative cases in our NHP CRC cohort.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> Transcriptional suppression of MLH1 by promoter hypermethylation is a major and widespread driver of genetic instability and carcinogenesis in rhesus macaque colorectal cancer. Differential DNA methylation in the promoter regions as observed in NHP CRCs can provide a screening target for liquid biopsies. This work highlights the possible translatability of naturally occurring NHP cancers for human cancer immunotherapy research and can be further explored in future tumor-bearing monkey trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/090ef733-0e27-4299-9f68-311f7de68a73\/@H03B8ZGS\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Mismatch repair deficiency,Animal models,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14628"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Simon Deycmar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brendan Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Declan Ryan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shane Sills<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Caudell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Greg Dugan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Schaaf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Whitlow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kiran Kumar Solingapuram Sai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Betsy Ferguson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Bimber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karina Ray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cassandra Cullin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandy Dozier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Armando Burgos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hettich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruno Gomes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jehad Charo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maurizio Ceppi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Cline<\/i><\/presenter>.

Mutations to p53 significantly improve the response rate to PD-1 ICB in lung cancer patients. Tumor-derived IL-33 is required for the anti-tumor immune response and efficacy of ICB. However, the relationship between p53 and IL-33 during ICB is unknown. In this study, we characterize the role of the p53\/IL-33 axis in regulating the response of the tumor microenvironment to ICB. We use CRISPR-Cas9 to delete Trp53 from murine MC38 colon adenocarcinoma. Deletion of Trp53 and PD-1 ICB synergistically inhibits tumor growth. Il33 is upregulated in the Trp53-deficient and treated tumor cells, and its expression increases with time and response to treatment. Cd4+ and Cd8+ T cell infiltration increases adjacent to IL-33 expressing tumor cells, while Treg infiltration is decreased. Simultaneous deletion of Il33 in MC38 tumors reverses the efficacy PD-1 ICB. Trp53-deficient MC38 in ST2-\/- (IL-33 receptor) mice also show no response to PD-1 ICB. Our findings depict a novel mechanism by which the loss of p53 in tumors treated with ICB unleashes the expression of tumoral IL-33 and induces downstream signaling. p53 mutations may be a double-edged sword for cancer, i.e. the loss of the tumor suppressor initially facilitates tumorigenesis, but eventual buildup of mutations and activation of damage pathways, such as NF-kB, leads to upregulation of danger signals in the tumor. These danger signals, such as IL-33, mediate the anti-tumor effect of ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f349a186-0c9b-4d71-a65b-99e3ea430865\/@H03B8ZGS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Immune checkpoint blockade,Interleukin-33,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14630"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Shihong Gao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Shoush<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Runzi Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Binfeng Lu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although many studies demonstrated that the inflammatory microenvironment can promote tumor growth through the activation of survival and proliferation programs in cancer cells, the reason why inflammation, an evolutionarily conserved response to damage aimed at reestablishing tissue integrity upon injury, might be integral to tumorigenesis still remains unknown. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a tumor characterized by poor prognosis, represents a distinctive example of cooperation between inflammation and activated oncogenes. Frequently developed in a context of chronic pancreatitis, PDAC is always associated with an inflammatory microenvironment. As supported by a substantial body of evidence across a multitude of experimental models, when occurring in the context of pancreatitis, mutations of KRAS, the universal oncogenic driver of pancreatic cancer, lead to accelerated tumor development inducing the appearance of neoplastic precursor lesions, such as acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), which can evolve into invasive tumors. Interestingly, preneoplastic pancreatic alterations, specifically ADM, have been previously identified in acute and chronic pancreatitis in the absence of oncogene activation. Investigating the effects of inflammation on normal pancreatic epithelial cells, we discovered that long after complete resolution a transient inflammatory event primes cells to cooperate with oncogenic KRAS. Indeed, upon recovery from a single acute inflammation, epithelial cells display an enduring adaptive response associated with sustained epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming. Such adaptation facilitates the prompt reactivation of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia upon subsequent inflammatory events, representing a physiological mechanism for limiting tissue damage <i>via<\/i> rapid decrease of zymogen production. Because metaplastic lesions are mediated by the activation of MAPK signaling, we demonstrated that activating mutations of KRAS, maintaining an irreversible ADM, are protective against tissue damage in a contest of pancreatitis. Uncovering a new physiologic role of somatic oncogenic mutations in preserving tissue integrity during repeated damages, we propose that KRAS mutations represent a nearly universal event in pancreatic cancer because beneficial and under strong positive selection in the context of recurrent pancreatitis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3308d12d-30fb-4713-8742-84c690c6e68c\/@J03B8ZGT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Progression,KRAS,Epithelial Memory,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14631"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>I-Lin Ho<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edoardo Del Poggetto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Balestrieri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Er-Yen Yen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Citron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rutvi Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaojun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shan Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wantong Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haoqiang Ying<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giannicola Genovese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Heffernan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anirban Maitra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linghua Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giulio Draetta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Carugo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gioacchino Natoli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Viale<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the resulting apoptotic and necrotic cell bodies (tumor cell &#8220;debris&#8221;) may stimulate tumor initiation and progression by disrupting the resolution of inflammation. Thus, chemotherapy and anti-estrogen breast cancer therapy, including tamoxifen, may be a <i>double-edged sword<\/i>. A paradigm shift is emerging in understanding the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel specialized pro-resolving lipid autocoid mediators (SPMs), such as maresins and endogenous resolution programs. Despite approaches to block systemic inflammation, there are no current &#8220;pro-resolving&#8221; therapies in cancer. To determine whether debris stimulates breast cancer growth, we utilized tumor dormancy models with a subthreshold (nontumorigenic) inoculum of tumor cells. We demonstrated that breast tumor &#8220;debris&#8221; generated by cytotoxic anti-estrogen therapy (tamoxifen or fulvestrant) or chemotherapy (eribulin) stimulates dormancy escape by triggering a macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic &#8220;cytokine storm&#8221;. Thus, tumor cell debris is a critical pro-tumorigenic factor in breast cancer initiation and progression. To assess whether stimulating the clearance of debris would suppress breast cancer progression, we utilized the SPMs maresin 1 (MaR1) and maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTR1, MCTR2). Each maresin (MaR1, MCTR1 and MCTR2) sharply reduced tumor growth in both debris-stimulated and spontaneous (e.g. MMTV-PyMT) breast cancer models at nanogram concentrations (15 ng\/day) without toxicity. Notably, maresins enhanced immunotherapy (anti-CTLA4) to induce tumor regression in estrogen receptor (ER) positive (EO771) and inhibit ER negative tumor growth (4T1). Maresins stimulated macrophage phagocytosis of therapy (fulvestrant and tamoxifen)-generated breast cancer debris at only nanomolar concentrations (0.1 - 10 nM). Remarkably, maresins alone or in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel) reduced levels of pro-angiogenic factors (e.g. CXCL12\/SDF-1) in the tumor microenvironment and decreased microvessel density\/size, thereby inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Maresins dampened the therapy-induced cytokine storm, by reducing levels of TNF-&#945;, MIP-2\/CXCL2, CCL2\/MCP-1, IL-1ra\/IL-1F3, CCL5, CXCL13, Serpin E1\/PAI-1, IL-1&#946; and G-CSF both <i>in vitro<\/i> in debris-stimulated macrophages and <i>in vivo <\/i>in plasma and tumor tissue. Stimulating the resolution of inflammation via pro-resolution lipid mediators to enhance immunotherapy is a novel host-centric therapeutic approach to prevent breast cancer initiation, dormancy escape and tumor progression via debris clearance and counter-regulation of the cytokine storm. Altogether, the maresin pathway mediators may represent a new therapeutic approach to stimulate the resolution of inflammation in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82969d04-09f4-428f-a191-82960b42419e\/@J03B8ZGT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Resolution of Inflammation,Lipid Mediators,Dormancy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14633"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Franciele Cristina Kipper<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianjun Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Rothenberger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abigail Kelly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madeline Duncan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sui Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles N.

Chromosome mis-segregation engenders the formation of micronuclei, which upon rupture chronically activates the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway. Tumor cGAS recognizes cytosolic DNA to generate cGAMP, a potent immune-stimulatory molecule that is readily exported into the extracellular space to enforce a type 1 IFN-mediated anti-tumor response in a host STING dependent manner. However, it is unclear how highly aggressive, unstable tumors have evolved to co-opt this chronic inflammatory signaling to drive tumorigenic behaviors and immune evasion. Here, we show that ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase\/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) may drive tumor metastasis through degradation of extracellular cGAMP. Using RNA sequencing of isogenic tumors, we uncovered a link between ENPP1 and CIN. We leveraged syngeneic mouse models to demonstrate that genetic perturbation of tumor ENPP1 and overexpression of a catalytically inactive ENPP1 mutant suppress metastasis. Furthermore, loss of ENPP1 increases tumor immune infiltration, reduces extracellular adenosine, and enhances response to immune checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on tumor cGAS and host STING. In line with these findings, ENPP1 expression correlates with immune suppression in human cancers. These results suggest that ENPP1-mediated hydrolysis of cGAMP may facilitate metastasis through evasion of immune surveillance, perhaps in part through cGAMP breakdown into immune-suppressive adenosine, in which the contributions of tumor and host adenosine can be further explored. Taken together, our study demonstrates how ENPP1-mediated hydrolysis of cGAMP can transform an otherwise inflammatory pathway into an immune-suppressive mechanism to promote tumor progression and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd030365-7de2-488e-923e-63564a5ad5e4\/@J03B8ZGT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Metastasis,Immunotherapy,Tumor metastases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14634"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John Young Ho Kwon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mercedes Duran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ninjit Dhanota<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Bakhoum<\/i><\/presenter>.

GBM is one of the &#8220;immune cold&#8221; tumors characterized by poor infiltration of T cells even though greater than 40% of glioma cells are composed of immune cells in some patients. The majority of immune cells in GBM are immune-suppressive myeloid cells that block T cell infiltration and\/or activation. To elucidate the mechanisms of immune evasion and to understand how the immune system interacts with glioma and stromal cells that shape the immune-suppressive landscape in GBM, there is an urgent need for immune-competent preclinical models that recapitulate the human disease. Human GBM is divided into three molecular subtypes (proneural:PR, classical:CL, and mesenchymal:MES) based on specific gene expression patterns and signature mutational profiles. Here, we report multi-dimensional analyses of six different transplantable mouse glioma models in the C57BL6\/J background that represent all three human GBM molecular subtypes. We performed whole-exome sequencing as well as STR fingerprinting of each primary tumorsphere line and also performed immune phenotyping of each glioma model with flow cytometry. To gain molecular insights and determine cellular heterogeneity, we also performed single-cell RNA sequencing from the six models. Glioma cell analysis at the single-cell level revealed that cell-of-origin rather than the oncogenic driver (such as EGFRviii) plays a dominant role in determining the molecular phenotypes of glioma cells, driving their classification into a molecular subtype defined by human studies. In addition, we identified eight molecular subtypes of glioma-associated myeloid (GAMs), seven different subtypes of T cells, and provide molecular definitions of glioma-associated pericytes and endothelial cells in murine gliomas. In addition, we performed cross-species comparisons of glioma and immune cell subtypes between humans and mice at the single-cell level. Furthermore, we report qualitative and quantitative differences in the cell-to-cell communication among different stromal cells and glioma cells in each model, and propose that these interactions shape the local niche and functional neighborhoods. Finally, we leverage these preclinical models to elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms that drive differential sensitivities of each model to immunotherapies: anti-PD1, CTLA4, and 4-1BB in vivo. In summary, we report deeply characterized mouse models of human GBM subtypes and highlight their utility as preclinical models for immunotherapy evaluation and foundational tumor immunology studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7682315d-2872-440b-afe4-f505f71bd210\/@J03B8ZGT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Immune checkpoint blockade,Glioblastoma,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14635"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Caiyi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Maldonado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas D.

The resulting A-to-I edit in RNA alters its post-transcriptional processing making Adar1 a critical regulator of gene expression. In line with its role in gene regulation, Adar1 has been implicated in development and organogenesis. We investigated the role of Adar1 in pancreatic development and homeostasis, and observed that though Adar1 is not required for pancreatic development, it is essential for pancreatic homeostasis. We observed that loss of Adar1 can stimulate a Mavs-mediated innate immune pathway and results in influx of immune cells in the pancreas. Pancreatic tumors are notorious for their immunosuppressive microenvironment. Since loss of Adar1 can activate a Mavs-mediated innate immune pathway, we next investigated the role of ADAR1 in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines.

PGE2 is also a mediator of adaptive resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy via the upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). While the role of PGE2 signaling in cancer is clear, how best to inhibit PGE2 for cancer treatment remains under investigation. Inhibition of COX-1 and\/or COX-2 has shown promising results in observational studies and meta-analyses, but inconsistent results in prospective studies. PGE2 signals through four receptors, EP1-4, that are variably expressed on tumor and immune cells and have distinct biological activities. The EP2 and EP4 receptors signal through cAMP and drive pro-tumor activities, while the EP1 and EP3 receptors signal through calcium flux and IP3 and drive immune activation and inflammation. While COX-2 and single EP inhibitors continue to be developed, the nature of PGE2 signaling supports our rationale to inhibit PGE2 by dual antagonism of the pro-tumor EP2\/EP4 receptors, while sparing the pro-immune EP1\/EP3 receptors. To our knowledge, TPST-1495 is the first clinical-stage dual inhibitor of both the EP2 and EP4 receptors. In mouse and human whole blood assays, dual blockade of EP2 and EP4 receptors with TPST-1495 reversed PGE2-mediated suppression of LPS-induced TNF-&#945;, while single receptor antagonists were unable to block suppression at higher PGE2 concentrations. Similarly, in murine and human T cells in vitro, TPST-1495 inhibited PGE2-mediated suppression, resulting in a significant increase of IFN-&#947; production in response to stimulation with cognate peptide antigen. In vivo, TPST-1495 monotherapy significantly reduced tumor outgrowth in CT26 tumor-bearing mice and correlated with increased tumor infiltration by NK cells, CD8+ T cells, AH1-specific CD8+ T cells, and other anti-tumor myeloid and adaptive immune cell populations. The relative contribution of increased immune infiltration may be simultaneously dependent on the immunogenicity of the tumor model and on the direct antitumor effect of TPST-1495, because we also observed significant tumor regression in metastatic burden in the LS174T xenograft model in NSG mice as well as CT26 tumors in RAG2-\/- animals, both of which are deficient in immune cell development. To that end, TPST- 1495 monotherapy significantly decreased the tumor burden compared to COX2 inhibition and EP2 or EP4 single antagonism in the Adenomatous Polyposis (APCmin\/+) model, a model that is hypo-responsive to PD-1 monotherapy. TPST-1495 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 first-in-human study (NCT04344795) to characterize PK, PD, safety, and to identify a recommended phase 2 dose for expansion cohorts in key indications and biomarker-selected patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/87727321-1b46-4181-95d5-5c418b7c9cbf\/@J03B8ZGT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Prostaglandin E2,Immunosuppression,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14637"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian Francica<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justine Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anja Holtz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dave Freund<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dingzhi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Enstrom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raymond Dubois<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francielle Kipper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dipak Panigrahy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chan Whiting<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Whiting<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas W.

TNBC tends to be more aggressive than most types of breast cancer and is more likely to recur even after surgery and treatment. Recently, a few targeted therapies were approved for TNBC, but additional molecular targeting agents are still needed. Previous studies have found that activated MerTK is associated with many types of human cancers, including breast cancer. In this study, we focused on MerTK expression and its tumorigenesis and immunoregulatory functions in TNBC. We first examined MerTK expression levels in human TNBC tissue samples by analyzing tissue microarrays (TMA) using immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC revealed that ~40% of TNBC samples expressed high levels of MerTK. We further examined MerTK expression levels in ten TNBC cell lines by immunoblot analysis. Three cell lines (BT549, MDAMB231 and MDAMB436) showed strong MerTK expression levels. Next, to evaluate MerTK&#8217;s effect on cell proliferation, we treated MDAMB231 cells with MerTK siRNA, which inhibited cell proliferation by 20% compared to siNon-target (siNT). These data indicate that TNBC cells remain dependent on MerTK-activated signaling pathways for proliferation and survival. To further investigate the impact of MerTK expression in TNBC cells, we stably overexpressed MerTK in the TNBC cell line SUM102, which naturally has very low MerTK levels. The results indicated that overexpression of MerTK in SUM102 cells led to: 1) increased proliferation in vitro 2) robust tumor growth, 3) marked migration potential and 4) increased metastasis in mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that activation of a MerTK-driven pathway could be involved in tumorigenesis in TNBC. To understand the role of MerTK in cell signaling and pro-tumor immunity, we utilized a cytokine array to examine which molecules were impacted in MerTK-overexpressing SUM102 cells. The results showed that production of CXCL4, CD74, and IL-1&#945; was increased, and production of CXCL10 was decreased in MerTK-overexpressing SUM102 cells as compared to control cells. Interestingly, PD-L1 was upregulated and MHC class I was downregulated in MerTK-overexpressing SUM102 cells as compared to control cells. These preliminary findings suggested that MerTK-overexpressing TNBC could be creating a favorable immune microenvironment for proliferation of tumor cells. To further explore the cytokine, PD-L1, and MHC class I results, we overexpressed MerTK in 4T1 murine TNBC-like cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that PD-L1 was upregulated in MerTK-overexpressing 4T1 cells. We will utilize this cell line to evaluate tumor growth and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment in BALB\/C mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6dcac17e-db85-40bc-85b4-29e244ed0558\/@J03B8ZGT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),MerTK,Tumorigenesis,immune evasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14638"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mari Iida<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kourtney Kostecki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlene A.

Notably, immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have recently been identified as a heterogeneous cell population that expand during tumor-associated inflammation and are significantly increased in the tumor, peripheral blood, as well as ascites of ovarian cancer patients. MDSCs contribute to tumor immune tolerance via inhibition of T-cell proliferation and activation. Signals from the tumor microenvironment in the form of soluble cytokines are proposed to lead to MDSC infiltration. It is also known that high tumor cell glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression is associated with a relatively poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. We hypothesized that ovarian cancer cell GR expression and activity may modulate tumor cell cytokine secretion thereby leading to increased MDSC generation and recruitment to the tumor, eventually creating an immunosuppressive environment. Our preliminary data confirm that GR activation in two high-grade ovarian cancer cell lines (HEYA8 and SKOV3) modulates the cytokine secretome. Our results demonstrate GR-mediated secretion of several pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive proteins including G-CSF, M-CSF, TGF-&#946;, and MCP-1 in those ovarian cancer models. We also observed downregulation of potent cytotoxic T-cell activating cytokines required for anti-tumor T-cell function including IL-2, IFN-&#947; and MIP1 upon GR activation. Importantly, treatment of cells with a competitive GR antagonist reverses this immunosuppressive secretome effect. Furthermore, upon culturing healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with tumor conditioned media from GR activated ovarian cancer cells, we show that secreted immunomodulatory factors have the capacity to promote differentiation of human MDSCs from PBMCs. The resulting MDSC population was characterized via expression of activation markers including Arginase-1, iNOS, VEGF and TGF-&#946;. Most importantly, the suppressive function of these MDSCs is being evaluated by determining their inhibitory potential on cytotoxic T-cell proliferation and\/or activation. Based on the insight provided by these data, we propose to determine whether ovarian tumor cell-intrinsic GR activation and resulting MDSC generation contributes to earlier relapse of GR-positive ovarian cancers, and eventually whether this mechanism may be targeted to improve patient outcomes in this subset of ovarian cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1d4d7538-a8ad-4ef8-a72d-c2847a87e53c\/@J03B8ZGT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Glucocorticoid receptor,Ovarian cancer,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14640"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manisha Taya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janet Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lynda Bennett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne D.

Although obesity is an established risk factor for basal-like BC, existing mouse models to study the interaction of basal-like BC and diet-induced obesity (DIO) are limited. The C3(1)\/SV40 large T-antigen (TAg) transgenic mouse is an established, human-relevant basal-like mammary cancer model developed on an obesity-resistant FVB genetic background. The goal of this study was to create and characterize a transplantable C3TAg model on an obesity-sensitive C57BL\/6J (B6) genetic background.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Male<b> <\/b>C3TAg transgenic FVB mice were backcrossed with female wild-type B6 mice for 10 generations. Spontaneous mammary tumors from these female B6:C3TAg mice were dissociated and subcloned, generating 4 distinct cell lines differing in their expression of metabolic genes. A pilot orthotopic transplant study using the 4 candidate cell lines (at 3 cell concentrations of each line) in 96 B6 mice identified cell line 2.51 as an attractive model for further evaluation based on in vivo growth characteristics and initial genomic analyses. To assess the impact of DIO in this model, 61 female B6 mice were randomized to receive either control (n=30) or DIO (n=31) diet regimens for 24 weeks, then were orthotopically injected into the 4<sup>th<\/sup> mammary fat pad with cell line 2.51 (2.5x10<sup>5 <\/sup>cells\/mouse). The mice continued on their respective diets, were monitored for tumor development, and were euthanized 4 weeks post-injection. Tumors were collected, weighed and flash frozen for genomic, immunologic and biochemical analyses.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>All 4 cell lines tested in the pilot study generated basal-like mammary tumors when orthotopically transplanted. Tumor gene expression profiling (via Affymetrix microarray) revealed inflammation and stem-like gene expression profiles discordant between cell lines tested, with tumors induced by cell line 2.51 showing striking enrichment in immune signatures relative to the other cell lines. DIO, relative to control diet, significantly accelerated transplanted 2.51 cell tumor progression, as indicated by increased tumor mass in mice from DIO relative to control diet-fed animals. Genomic, biochemical, and immunological assessment of the tumor-enhancing effects of DIO in this model are ongoing.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Herein, we report the development and characterization of a novel transplantable C3TAg mammary tumor model in C57BL\/6J mice, highly responsive to energy balance.

However, current understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of these smoking-induced cancers remains unclear. Though vaping has been proposed as a safer alternative to cigarette smoking, more research is needed to fully understand its potential to cause cancer. In particular, the chemicals in e-cigarette (e-cig) vapor have previously been demonstrated to cause immune dysregulation, similar to conventional cigarette smoke. In this study, we aimed to investigate the immune-associated (IA) genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of a panel of smoking-induced cancers in order to identify common and unique elements among these cancers and to determine whether certain immune dysregulations may be shared between smoking and vaping.<br \/>Methods: Whole genome sequencing data from tumors and adjacent normal samples was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to compare the IA landscapes of 5 different smoking-induced cancers: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Differentially expressed genes were identified and correlated to tumor stage and patient survival. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and ReactomeFi were used to correlate IA gene expression to cancer pathway enrichment. The REVEALER algorithm was used to correlate gene expression to copy number variations and mutations.<br \/>Results: We found that the genomic landscapes of smoking-induced cancers were largely unique. However, Osteopontin (OPN), an IA gene capable of regulating the EGFR and CD44 signaling cascades, was found to be upregulated along with its downstream targets in HNSCC, LUAD, LUSC, and ESCA smoking patients. Such upregulation was correlated to poorer prognosis for all 4 cancers. <i>In vitro<\/i> study indicated an upregulation of OPN and its downstream targets in cell lines exposed to both e-cig vapor and cigarette smoke.<br \/>Conclusions: Despite few similarities among the IA landscapes of these smoking-induced cancers, we suggest the importance of OPN upregulation in HNSCC, LUSC, LUAD, and ESCA pathogenesis caused by smoking and, potentially, vaping.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f5ff6ba7-5f7d-4690-ac20-a4b2edc1065e\/@r03B8ZGU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Smoking,Tobacco smoke,,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14643"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jaideep Chakladar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil Shende<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Tse Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weg M.

Preclinical in vivo models to assess efficacy associated with immune cell engagement are needed. Here we evaluated an EGFR bispecific T cell engager (EGFRXCD3 BiTE) using xenograft models in humanized NSG&#8482; (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl\/SzJ) mice that have been engrafted with human CD34+ HSC and have human T cells in circulation. Three EGFR+ tumor models were used in this report including LG1202 lung PDX and two triple negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 with a high EGFR expression level and MDA-MB-453 with a low EGFR expression. Interestingly we found that all three models were resistant to EGFR monoclonal antibody drug cetuximab despite the expression of EGFR but responded to EGFRXCD3 BiTE. BiTE-induced T cell activation was evident through the analysis of tumor infiltrated lymphocytes by flow cytometry at the end of the study. BiTE treatment for 3 weeks effectively reduced the LG1202 tumor growth whereas the effect of cetuximab on the tumor growth was minimal. In the BiTE-treated group, CD3+ T cell percentage increased as compared to the vehicle group, and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets showed an increased frequency of CD69+ cells. We also observed elevated levels of human cytokines IFN-&#947;, IL-6, IL-2, and IL-10 in circulation 4 h after animals received the first BiTE dose. We evaluated the dose response of BiTE treatments on MDA-MB-231 model with a high EGFR expression. Low dose BiTE reduced tumor growth whereas high dose BiTE effectively prevented or even regressed some tumor growth. Flow analysis showed that tumor CD3+ T cell frequency remained similar to the vehicle group but CD8+ T frequency increased after high dose BiTE. High CD69+CD8+ T cell frequency was found in the vehicle group and the percentage further increased after high dose BiTE. For the low EGFR-expressing MDA-MB-453 model, BiTE treatment for 4 weeks also effectively reduced the tumor growth. In comparison, while cetuximab treatment decreased EGFR expression on tumor cells, it did not reduce the tumor growth. Flow analysis showed that BiTE-treated group had increased T cell infiltration into the tumors when compared to the PBS and cetuximab groups. The frequency and cell number of CD25+ and CD69+ CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in the tumor increased after BiTE treatment. Together, these data support our humanized mouse model to be used to validate T-cell dependent bispecific antibody efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/33f226c0-a464-4714-8832-2aad24b913e1\/@r03B8ZGU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BiTE antibody,Mouse models,Efficacy,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15857"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Li-Chin Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>James G.

Despite recent advances in molecular profiling and characterization of pediatric high-grade gliomas, patient outcomes have not improved. One critical reason why current therapeutic approaches fail to provide a durable response is the adaptive nature of the highly understudied tumor microenvironment (TME). The most abundant non-neoplastic infiltrates in the DIPG TME are the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). There is limited data available on the role of TAMs in DIPG tumor growth and response to therapy, and the chemokines responsible for driving the infiltration of both innate and adaptive immune cells into these tumors remain unidentified.To accurately model DIPGs, we utilized immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) based on the RCAS\/tv-a gene transfer system. At postnatal days 0-2, mice were injected with retrovirus-producing DF-1 cells directly in the brainstem. Tumorigenesis was driven by PDGFB overexpression and <i>Tp53<\/i> silencing, together with human DIPG-specific mutations including: H3 histones with K27M substitution (H3.1<sup>K27M<\/sup>\/H3.3<sup>K27M<\/sup>) and <i>Acvr1<\/i><sup>R206H<\/sup>. Our data using these GEMMs show that mouse tumors are strikingly similar to their human counterparts as demonstrated by hallmark pathological observations including T2-contrast enhancement, highly infiltrating margins, and pseudopalisading necrosis. Loss of H3K27 trimethylation in histone mutant tumors is also observed in these tumors. Utilizing these GEMMs, we have identified CCL8 and CCL12 as important chemokines in H3.1<sup>K27M<\/sup>-DIPGs. Specifically, we observed longer survival in <i>Ccl8\/Ccl12 <\/i>double knockout<i> <\/i>(DKO) tumor-bearing mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, spectral flow cytometry analysis revealed no differences in myeloid cell infiltration but an increased number of NK cells, CD4<sup>+<\/sup>, and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in tumors generated in <i>Ccl8\/Ccl12 <\/i>DKO mice compared to WT. We also tested the efficacy of inhibiting two CCL8 receptors using a syngeneic mouse model of DIPG. Pharmacological inhibition of CCR1 and CCR5 rendered a reduction in macrophage presence in the tumors, and resulted in an extension of survival in tumor-bearing mice comparable to the effect of standard of care, radiation therapy. Our ongoing experiments aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which CCL8 and CCL12 modulate immune cell infiltration, and determine whether the effect of CCL8\/CCL12 loss on survival seen in H3.1<sup>K27M<\/sup>-DIPG holds true for H3.3<sup>K27M<\/sup>-DIPG-bearing mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/60acabd4-25e3-4b8e-942e-b9925ee4529e\/@r03B8ZGU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,DIPG,Tumor-associated macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21047"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gonzalo M.

Recent evidence links microbiota and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), an aggressive cancer surrounded by a highly immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment which limits efficacy of most available therapies. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of PDAC is partially facilitated by a proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin 17 (IL-17). IL-17 can be stimulated by intestinal commensal bacteria under normal physiological conditions. It is critical for microbial defense as well as immunopathology. Both IL-17 neutralization and antibiotics reduce murine PDAC growth. While the vital role of microbiota in affecting tumor immunity has been identified, there is still a gap of knowledge as to how microbes may regulate pro-tumorigenic IL-17 signaling. We wanted to investigate the systemic and local role of IL-17 in regulating the microbial-tumor immune axis. For this purpose, we genetically deleted the IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) in different compartments and evaluated tumor growth. We found that IL-17RA signaling was important for maintaining microbial homeostasis and its disruption resulted in differential tumor growth. Absence of IL-17RA signaling in the gut lead to local inflammation as well as systemic immune effects. Our data suggests that modulation of IL-17 signaling could serve as a therapeutic intervention to alter microbial mediated tumor effects. The significance of these findings may extend to other cancers as well.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9eae5779-f867-4939-9d7d-b106cdcd3cac\/@r03B8ZGU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Immuno-oncology,Interleukin-17,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21446"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vidhi Chandra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivereen Le Roux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Petrosino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Kolls<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florencia McAllister<\/i><\/presenter>.
