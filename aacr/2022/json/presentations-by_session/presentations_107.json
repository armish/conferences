These cells have intriguing characteristics: i) they form primary lesions as efficiently as their tumor-initiating counterparts, but are exclusive in their ability to generate metastases; ii) they express the fatty acid translocase CD36, and are characterized by a unique lipid metabolic signature; iii) they are exquisitely sensitive to the levels of fat in circulation, and consequently, they relate the predisposition of metastasis directly to the content of dietary fat; iv) they are highly sensitive to CD36 inhibition, which almost completely abolishes their metastatic potential in preclinical models. In my talk, I will present our latest data on the molecular characterization of metastatic-initiating cells. I will place special emphasis showing how specific dietary lipids exert a striking long-term epigenetic effect over metastatic-initiating cells related to activation of intra-tumor Schwann cells, putting forward a novel concept of &#168;metastatic epigenetic memory&#168; elicited by our diet.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Salvador Aznar-Benitah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

To sustain enhanced growth, and to resist stresses associated with cancer treatments, cancer cells become highly dependent on the uptake of exogenous nutrients, particularly amino acids. Amino acid metabolism supports tumour growth and survival in numerous ways, particularly in the provision of anabolic precursors for macromolecule (e.g. protein and DNA) synthesis, as well as stress responsive antioxidant pathways (e.g. glutathione\/GSH synthesis). We have shown that uptake of exogenous serine and glycine is key nutrient dependency for many cancer cells, simultaneously supporting THF-dependent one carbon metabolism and GSH synthesis. More recently we have defined a role for immune-regulated IDO1 dependent tryptophan metabolism as an alternative one-carbon source for nucleotide synthesis, underlining the potential flexibility of tumour metabolism. The sensitivity of certain cancer cells to cysteine starvation is well established, and multiple mechanisms contribute to cysteine withdrawal sensitivity, including transsulfuration activity and methylation reactions. We have recently defined a role for methionine driven polyamine metabolism in sensitising cells to cysteine starvation, particularly in the context of <i>MTAP<\/i> gene deletion. Improved understanding of cancer specific amino acid metabolism is defining genetically driven metabolic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically exploited by a combination of diet and small molecules.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Oliver Maddocks<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
