[{"Abstract":"Liver cancer incidence rates have more than tripled in the last 40 years and is projected to increase more than 40% in the next decade. Although progress has been made, there is still limited therapeutic options. Due to the various etiological factors associated in HCC development and late stage in which it is diagnosed, the five-year survival rate is only 20%. Molecularly, more than 80% of HCC has an alteration in MYC signaling. Yet, MYC remains undruggable and studies over the recent years show that targeting proteins that regulate MYC is a promising approach in developing anti-cancer therapies. One such protein is the RNA binding protein (RBP) Negative Elongation Factor E (NELFE). We recently demonstrated for the first-time that NELFE recruits MYC via protein-protein interactions to the chromatin to control the expression of pro-survival genes. Consistent with the role of NELFE as a regulator of MYC in these cancers, we showed that patients with aberrant NELFE expression concurrently have active MYC signaling and poor outcome. These studies suggest that the NELFE\/MYC interplay may be important for HCC maintenance. Thus, our hypothesis is that NELFE modulates the chromatin landscape to facilitate MYC-induced transcription to promote HCC. To investigate NELFE&#8217;s effect on MYC-induced transcription, we performed NELFE and MYC ChIP-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing analyses on CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated NELFE knockout HCC cells. We found NELFE depletion resulted in significant reduction in nucleosomal accessibility and MYC binding to the chromatin near promoter-proximal regions. Although NELFE depletion alters the chromatin landscape, we found it rarely interacts with the chromatin, specifically within MYC bound regions, suggesting that the MYC\/NELFE interaction is facilitated by a third protein. NELFE co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analyses identified the protein SWI\/SNF Related, Matrix Associated, Actin Dependent Regulator Of Chromatin, Subfamily B, Member 1 (SMARCB1) as a potential MYC cofactor that facilitates the NELFE\/MYC interaction. Immunoblotting analyses show NELFE interacts with SMARCB1 and MYC and loss of NELFE significantly reduced SMARCB1\/MYC interactions, indicating that NELFE facilitates chromatin accessibility through SMARCB1, which is required for MYC-induced transcription. Future studies include investigating SMARCB1&#8217;s oncogenic role in HCC through NELFE\/MYC signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3b6469f5-31d0-4dc1-848e-04f373ea2df4\/@G03B8ZJy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16163"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kai Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Anna Barry<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Lamm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hien Dang<\/i><\/presenter>.

We had previously reported single cell mRNA atlas of the breast. In this study, we performed scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq of breast tissues from 22 women of Ashkenazi (A) ancestry (19,935 nuclei), 20 women of European (non-A) ancestry (19,090 nuclei), six BRCA1 (6,261 nuclei) and five BRCA2 (3,400 nuclei) mutation carriers to correlate cell type-specific gene expression with chromatin accessibility. An integrated analysis revealed 17 cell clusters including basal, luminal progenitor, and mature luminal epithelial cells, two endothelial subtypes and two fibroblast\/mesenchymal stem-like cell types. Basal cells could be further subdivided into two subclusters that differentially expressed genes such as TSHZ2, POSTN and ETV6. Similarly, there were four luminal progenitor subclusters that differentially expressed genes such as MALAT1, SOX13, and MDM4. Although ESR1 expression was observed predominantly in mature luminal cells, binding sites for ESR1 were accessible in multiple epithelial and non-epithelial cells with the exception of basal cells. FOXA1 expression and binding site enrichment were observed mostly in mature luminal cells. GATA3 expression was observed in all epithelial cell types with highest expression in mature luminal cells but binding sites for GATA3 were accessible in multiple cell types. Expression and binding site enrichment of alveolar differentiation-associated EHF were predominant in luminal progenitor cells. TP63 expression and binding site enrichment were restricted to basal cells, which is consistent with the proposed role of TP63 in maintaining stem cells among the basal cell populations. EMT-associated ZEB1 showed an intriguing pattern. Similar to our published immunohistochemistry-based analysis of breast tissues, ZEB1 expression was detected in fibroblasts\/mesenchymal cells, endothelial cells and adipocytes but not in epithelial cells. However, binding sites for this transcription factor were enriched in epithelial cell types and in T-cells. ZEB1 mRNA stability is tightly controlled by the epithelial cell-enriched miR-200 family of microRNAs, and it is possible that ZEB1 transcribed in epithelial cells is immediately targeted for degradation through miR-200. To gain insight into this possibility, we examined the chromatin accessibility status of ZEB1 regulatory regions in fibroblasts\/mesenchymal cells and in epithelial cells. ZEB1 regulatory regions displayed open chromatin status in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts. With the exception of a few genes such as SIGLEC1 in macrophages and IL7R in T cells, cell type-specific expression of many genes is not controlled at the level of chromatin accessibility of their regulatory regions. Collectively, these results reveal complexities in gene expression in different cell types of the breast.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f5a75c29-e097-49b2-a5f7-657b977c97af\/@G03B8ZJy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast,Single cell,Chromatin remodeling,Transcription,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16164"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Poornima Bhat-Nakshatri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Duojiao Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyu Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunlong Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Maria Storniolo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Harikrishna Nakshatri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Here, we use optimized protocols to perform ChIP-seq and RNA-seq on patient surgical samples, which we use to define promoter, typical-enhancer, and super-enhancer (SE) regulatory regions with differential chromatin states (i.e. H3K27ac signal) between tumor and normal samples. We then leverage publicly available transcription factor (TF) cistrome data to test 372 TFs for tumor or normal specific enrichment across these differential regulatory regions. We identify 31 tumor-specific TF enrichments, such as TP53\/63\/73, NKX2-1, JUNB\/D, FOSL1\/2, E2F1\/3, KLF3\/4\/5, SMAD3\/4, TEAD1\/4, TFAP2A\/C, HIF1A, PPARG, GRHL2, EPAS1, and SNAI2. A number of these enriched TFs, including TP63, TP73, FOSL1, and E2F1, show both significantly increased expression in tumors and significant transcriptional reductions after JQ1 treatment. These results provide novel insight into the regulatory biology of HPV+ HNSCC, and suggest that the transcriptional networks and feedback loops governing TF expression and dysregulation in HPV+ HNSCC can be targeted using JQ1 treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1dc7ef2b-65ac-439e-bfe5-ecf1cd974c82\/@H03B8ZJz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Transcription factor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16165"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Fernando Zamuner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Spencer S.

There are currently no effective therapies. Surgical resection remains the only option to date, but it is not viable for patients who present with metastasis. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify therapeutic targets. The hallmark genetic lesion of FLC, occurring in &#62;80% of patients, was recently identified to be a ~400kb heterozygous deletion on chromosome 19, leading to the oncogenic fusion protein DNAJB1-PRKACA (DP).<br \/>We recently used FLC primary tumors and matched non-malignant liver samples to map the chromatin activity landscape of FLC by chromatin run-on sequencing, or ChRO-seq, which is a state-of-the-art technology for quantifying nascent transcription and defining active regulatory elements across the genome. We identified nearly 7000 FLC-specific enhancers and ~150 &#8220;super-enhancers&#8221; (SEs) - dense clusters of highly active enhancers that mark nearby critical oncogenes. Despite these advances, a major limitation is the bulk tissue nature of the study - that is, these data reflect an average profile across numerous different cell types (hepatocytes, stellate cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells, etc.), and therefore it is not evident which enhancers and genes are active in which cell types. <i>This represents a major knowledge gap. If we could learn the specific cell types in which FLC enhancers and genes are active, we could then study the functions of these genes in FLC with greater precision and develop more effective targeted therapeutics.<\/i> I recently conducted single-cell <u>A<\/u>ssay for <u>T<\/u>ransposase <u>A<\/u>ccessible <u>C<\/u>hromatin ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) to bridge this knowledge gap. I identified eight clusters from FLC-Primary, FLC-Metastatic, and non-malignant liver (NML) samples. Dimensionality reduction reveals two FLC-Primary, and FLC-Metastatic derived clusters that exhibit an epithelial-like identity most closely related to NML-epithelial cells. Using this scATAC-seq dataset, I have deconvoluted and resolved the bulk resolution limitations of ChRO-seq signal. ScATAC-seq reveals ChRO-seq defined candidate genes are highly accessible in FLC-Primary and FLC-Metastatic transformed Epithelial Cells. I have also dissected ChRO-seq defined SE&#8217;s and detailed the proportion of active constituent enhancers within each cell type. Further analysis revealed cell-type-specific transcriptional networks. Together, these studies provide the first single-cell resolution understanding of the transcriptional network in FLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7249d0e4-03f9-4376-878f-54e1f843425c\/@H03B8ZJz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Genomics,Fusion genes,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16166"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alaa R.

Both <i>E-R+<\/i> and <i>E-R<\/i>-like B-ALL show frequent inactivating mutations or deletions of <i>ETV6<\/i>, which encodes an ETS family transcriptional repressor (core binding motif GGAA\/T). Signature genes overexpressed in <i>E-R+<\/i> B-ALL, such as <i>EPOR<\/i> and <i>PIK3C3,<\/i> were shown to sustain the malignant phenotype.<br \/>We performed H3K27ac ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq on 26 B-cell cancer cell lines to identify subtype-specific active enhancer-like elements. Unbiased K-means clustering identified distal elements that were selectively acetylated in four <i>E-R<\/i>+ B-ALL cell lines (all with inactivation of the second <i>ETV6<\/i> allele) and in a fifth B-ALL cell line with biallelic <i>ETV6<\/i> deletion. Motif analysis of this cluster showed strong enrichment for tandem repeats of the sequence &#8220;GGAA&#8221; (p&#60;10<sup>-100<\/sup>). Repeats with &#8805;6 tandem copies of &#8220;GGAA&#8221; were selectively acetylated and accessible in H3K27ac ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets from primary patient samples of <i>E-R<\/i>+ B-ALL, but not from other genetic subtypes that lack <i>ETV6<\/i> aberrations.<br \/>Doxycycline-inducible expression of <i>ETV6<\/i> in <i>ETV6<\/i>-deficient, <i>E-R<\/i>+ B-ALL cells led to significant growth inhibition. Restored ETV6 bound extensively to GGAA repeats (80% of ETV6 binding sites), repressed repeat enhancer acetylation, and repressed expression of adjacent <i>E-R<\/i>+ signature genes (n=40). Repression of a published <i>E-R+<\/i> signature gene set was significant by GSEA analysis (p&#60;0.001). Direct CRISPR-interference repression of 6 GGAA repeat enhancers led to significant downregulation of their associated <i>E-R<\/i>+ signature genes, including <i>EPOR<\/i> and <i>PIK3C3<\/i>.<br \/>GGAA repeat enhancers are a known driver of Ewing sarcoma, where they are activated by oncogenic fusions of the ETS activators FLI1 or ERG. Active GGAA repeat enhancers and repeat-regulated genes in <i>E-R+<\/i> B-ALL show only partial overlap with repeat-regulated genes in Ewings, possibly due to tissue-specific factors. Wild-type <i>ERG<\/i> and <i>FLI1<\/i> are highly expressed in B-ALL. We found that knockdown of <i>ERG,<\/i> but not <i>FLI1<\/i>, led to significant downregulation of repeat enhancer-regulated <i>E-R+<\/i> signature genes in B-ALL. ChIP-Seq showed that the ERG binds nearly all active GGAA repeat enhancers in three <i>ETV6<\/i>-deficient B-ALL cell lines, but not in <i>ETV6<\/i>-intact B-ALL.<br \/>We identify GGAA repeat enhancers, sustained by <i>ETV6<\/i> deficiency and strong <i>ERG<\/i> expression, as a unifying mechanism for a subtype-specific oncogenic gene expression program in B-ALL. Our findings may have crucial implications for <i>E-R<\/i>+ B-ALL modeling, as most GGAA repeats are not conserved between mice and humans. Mechanisms that activate leukemia-specific repeat enhancers may represent appealing targets for future therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4fc5c2ca-f5bd-41f8-a473-0b354f73723d\/@H03B8ZJz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EWS-FLI1,ETV6,ERG,enhancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16167"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"f47db95a-e368-46b7-9f33-aaeb0b879766","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f47db95a-e368-46b7-9f33-aaeb0b879766\/@H03B8ZJz\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joshua W.

It has been shown to mobilize (<i>i.e.,<\/i> retrotranspose) in cancers, causing <i>de novo<\/i> somatic L1 insertions. Somatic L1 retrotransposition can cause aberrant splicing of tumor suppressor genes by utilizing cryptic splice donor (SD) sites such as the nucleotide 97 SD in the L1 5&#8217;UTR or disrupting repressive regulatory regions of proto-oncogenes, inducing aberrant activation, leading to cancer.<br \/>In contrast to these reported mechanisms, here we report the first evidence of a driver oncogene activation due to somatic acquisition of an L1 promoter in a pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG). While investigating activation of <i>FOXR2 <\/i>(forkhead box R2), a known oncogene in CNS embryonal tumors, in a recurrent pediatric diffuse HGG that showed a methylation profile of CNS <i>FOXR2<\/i>-activated tumors, we identified overexpression of a non-canonical <i>FOXR2<\/i> isoform. Transcription of <i>FOXR2 <\/i>initiated from ~11kb upstream of exon 2 at a site harboring a somatic structural variation (SV) reminiscent of an L1 insertion. Targeted PCR amplification and subsequent PacBio sequencing revealed a 5&#8217; inverted\/deleted L1 insertion (~3kb sequence) containing an intact L1 5&#8217;UTR, presence of a 3&#8217; transduction sequence, two poly-A tails, and target site duplications<i>.<\/i> The 3&#8217; transduction sequence matches the sequence downstream an intact polymorphic full-length L1 element at 6p24.1, the likely source L1 element that initiated the <i>FOXR2<\/i> somatic insertion. Strikingly, tumor RNA-seq data reveals<i> FOXR2<\/i> transcription initiated from the intact sense pol-II promoter of the inserted L1 5&#8217;UTR, generating a fusion transcript joining the L1 5&#8217;UTR 97 SD to a canonical splice acceptor within exon 2 of <i>FOXR2.<\/i> Targeted bisulfite sequencing of the <i>FOXR2<\/i> L1 5&#8217;UTR revealed a hypomethylated state, further supporting its role in <i>FOXR2<\/i> transcription initiation. FOXR2 activation is likely a tumor initiating event as the following was observed in the primary tumor that occurred two years prior: a matching recurrent tumor methylation profile, the presence of L1\/<i>FOXR2<\/i> fusion transcripts, and overexpression of <i>FOXR2<\/i>. Additional driver mutations, clonal <i>TP53<\/i> R175H mutation and <i>PDGFRA<\/i> amplification, identified in the recurrent tumor but absent in the primary tumor, support the somatic L1 insertion as a tumor initiating event occurring prior to later acquired alterations. Our data represent the first example of oncogenic activation by L1 &#8220;promoter donation&#8221; via somatic retrotransposition as a novel tumor initiating mechanism. Future large-scale research and development of new computational methods for detecting rearranged L1 insertions are required to determine the prevalence of L1 &#8220;promoter donation&#8221; in cancer or other diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/51bd8b8b-0111-4122-98f3-556d80b76cc2\/@H03B8ZJz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Mobile element,Targeted sequencing,Somatic mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16170"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaolong Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diane A.

Dysregulated TGF-&#946; signaling and loss of SIRT6 activity are implicated in fatty liver disease. SIRT6 limits fibrosis by inhibiting SMAD3 activity and limits de novo lipogenesis by inhibiting SREBP1 and SREBP2 activity. We hypothesized that altered reciprocal regulation between TGF-&#946; signaling and SIRT6 contributes to NAFLD and its progression. The goal of this study was to identify regulatory crosstalk between SIRT6 and SMAD3 and SPTBN1, a regulator of SMAD3 activity.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used bioinformatics and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with HepG2 cells to examine the binding of SMAD3 or CTCF to the <i>SIRT6<\/i> gene in the presence or absence of TGF-&#946;.<b> <\/b>Using cultured cells, we examined the effect of altering SPTBN1 or SMAD3 on SIRT6 abundance, and of altering SIRT6 on SPTBN1 and SMAD3 abundance. We examined liver phenotypes of <i>SPTBN1<sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice fed either a normal chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) and monitored body weight and serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, as well as analyzed liver tissue for SIRT6 abundance.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified two consensus SMAD-binding elements and two consensus CTCF binding sites in the <i>SIRT6<\/i> promoter and showed by ChIP that TGF-&#946; stimulated SMAD3 and CTCF binding to the promoter region of SIRT6. We found that deficiency in SMAD3 or SPTBN1 reduced SIRT6 mRNA and protein abundance. Overexpression of SIRT6 reduced expression of selected TGF-&#946;-induced genes. Knockdown of SIRT6 increased SPTBN1 but not SMAD3 abundance and overexpression of SIRT6 reduced only SPTBN1 abundance.

Moreover, PCa malignancy disproportionally strikes more on African American (AA) men than any other ethnic groups including Caucasian American (CA) men. Forkhead Box A1 (FOXA1) is frequently mutated in hormone receptor-driven cancers including PCa. FOXA1 mutation rates in AA PCa specimens are 3-fold higher than that in CA PCa. By annotating the FOXA1 mutation landscape two hotspots were defined in AA PCa patients located in the forkhead domain: D226N and R219C. FOXA1 expression and functions are regulated by lysine [K]-specific demethylase 5B (KDM5B). KDM5B contributes to the activation of signaling pathways that promote cancer progression. Here in this project, we will focus on the mechanistic role of FOXA1 dysregulation and its interaction with KDM5B and AR on PCa progression in AA vs CA PCa cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that the dysregulation of FOXA1 plays an essential role in the progression of PCa by altering chromatin remodeling and AR interaction, and FOXA1 mutation promotes more aggressive malignancies in AA PCa cells.<b> <\/b>In order to investigate the biological function and regulation of FOXA1 in PCa cells we first need to knockout (KO) the endogenous expression using CRISPR technology and then knockin (KI) the unique mutants R219C and D226N.

The findings from this study will provide valuable insights into the contributions of the FOXA1 regulation and will add to our knowledge base for the potential development of a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce PCa disparities between AA and CA populations.

Deregulation of the master transcription factor, MYC, is found in virtually all PDAC tumors and promotes genomic alterations by increasing replication stress, augmenting DNA repair pathways, and promoting cell survival. To resolve replication stress, stalled forks are trafficked to the nuclear pores where the necessary machinery accumulates. Activated MYC is spatially reorganized to the nuclear pores as well, a mechanism that is exacerbated in cancer. Whether MYC activity at the nuclear pores contributes to resolving replication stress in PDAC remains to be known. To investigate this mechanism, we are creating genomic and proteomic tools to determine MYC&#8217;s function at the nuclear pores during replication stress induced by olaparib treatment in PDAC cells. We found that olaparib significantly increases MYC accumulation at the nuclear pore in low-passage cell lines we established from PDAC patient tumors. Furthermore, we showed that MYC interacts with the nuclear pore resident SUMO protease, SENP1, which plays a key role in resolving stalled forks. Our preliminary data suggest a role for MYC resolving replication stress at nuclear pores, and could indicate MYC activity as a therapeutic target in olaparib-resistant PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/64b558bb-41b9-4182-a59f-df393556cee7\/@H03B8ZJz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Genomic instability,Post-transcriptional regulation,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16174"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gabriel Cohn<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colin J.

Particularly, the epigenetic regulations that dictate the oncogenic MYC signaling and its downstream mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library screen of 3,669 sgRNAs that targeted the transcription start sites of 728 epigenetic-related genes, and identified the requirement of the NuA4 (Nucleosome acetyltransferase of histone H4) complex in EwS. Subsequently, we developed a custom CRISPR-knockout (KO) library targeting all 18 members of the NuA4 complex at 25 sgRNA\/gene. These orthogonal CRISPR screens revealed an essential role of RUVBL1 (an ATPase component of NuA4) in EwS. Suppression of RUVBL1 led to the loss of histone H4 acetylation (mass spectrometry), attenuated in vivo tumor growth (xenograft modeling), and ablated MYC signaling (RNA-seq). While the expression of MYC protein was unaffected by RUVBL1-KO, we observed a drastic reduction of the chromatin-associated MYC (ChIP-seq) in the sgRUVBL1 transduced cells, highlighting the pivotal role of RUVBL1 in MYC chromatin binding and target gene transactivation. Mechanistically, we discovered a RUVBL1\/MYC co-regulated gene EEF1A1 (a translation elongation factor) to be essential for the survival and protein synthesis of EwS cells. We also found that RUVBL1 interacts with MYC and recruits KAT5 (a histone acetyltransferase in NuA4) to modify the histone H4K8 and H4K12 for acetylation, which are required for the expression of EEF1A1. Furthermore, we conducted a high-density CRISPR gene body scan of 194 sgRNAs that tiled the coding exons of RUVBL1 at ~7.1 bp\/sgRNA (i.e., ~2.4 aa\/sgRNA). Using this unbiased approach and combined with 3D structural modeling, we uncovered the critical role of a previously unrecognized lysine residue K108 in RUVBL1, which locates at the center of the RUVBL1 hexameric ring structure, to mediate the MYC interaction and MYC target gene expression. Based on these observations, we rationalized a combinational approach to block the oncogenic MYC signaling via simultaneously targeting RUVBL1 (by CB-6644; inhibits RUVBL1&#8217;s ATPase activity) and MYC (by JQ1; suppresses MYC expression), and revealed an improved therapeutic index in both established EwS cell lines and the patient-derived EwS samples. In conclusion, our results identified RUVBL1 as a novel vulnerability in EwS, which controls the amplitude of MYC signaling via tuning the chromatin binding of MYC. This notion can be exploited to synergize with other MYC-targeting therapeutics for an improved EwS therapy. We also expect this mechanism to be broadly applicable to other MYC-driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2486c416-15ed-4bb4-a683-2918e7c98c32\/@H03B8ZJz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Myc,Signaling pathways,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16176"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mingli Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheela Pokharel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Mattson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiao Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaobao Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chun-Wei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Inappropriate responses lead to disease processes, such as cancer. Despite improvements in targeted treatment options, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, illustrating the need to develop new highly effective targeted therapies. 14-3-3 interacts with a network of proteins to support signaling pathways promoting oncogenesis, metastasis, growth, cellular survival, and chemoresistance in a variety of cancers, including lung, prostate, and breast. We recently identified prostate tumor overexpressed 1 (PTOV1) as a novel 14-3-3 interacting protein promoting tumorigenic gene expression patterns. We showed that 14-3-3 binding sequesters PTOV1 in the cytoplasm and protects PTOV1 from proteasomal degradation. Using double thymidine block synchronization, we now demonstrate that both PTOV1 phosphorylation and total PTOV1 levels peak in G1, prior to PTOV1 translocating into the nucleus during S phase. These data support our model that 14-3-3-PTOV1 binding maintains PTOV1 in the cytoplasm during G1, where it is stabilized to carry out translational regulation. As the cell enters S phase, loss of phosphorylation and the accompanying loss of 14-3-3 binding allows PTOV1 to translocate into the nucleus, carry out relevant nuclear functions, and then be degraded via the proteasome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/144a7485-a931-4f88-b591-cbb89301a2ff\/@H03B8ZJz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"14-3-3,PTOV1,SGK2,HUWE1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16178"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katie L.

They bind to their DNA response elements and modulate the transcription of target genes via interaction with co-regulators termed co-activators or co-repressors. Estrogen Receptor &#945; (ER&#945;) is an important member of this family which is expressed in in hormone receptor positive (ER<sup>+<\/sup>) breast cancer, one of the leading causes of death among women. Current therapeutic options involve endocrine therapies, however despite its effectiveness, a significant number of patients eventually experience resistance to these treatments, leading to disease recurrence and relapse. One of the major hurdles to combat resistant cells, is lack of comprehensive information about ER&#945; transcriptional complex activity. While biochemical assays have provided significant information on interaction with its coregulators, it is not clear how the dynamic between these transpire. This is while ER&#945; is a highly dynamic protein with a fast rate of interaction with coregulators and cycling between chromatin, nucleus, and cytosol. Consequently, it is critical to imply techniques that allow direct visualization of ER&#945; activity and gain spatiotemporal information on its regulation. One of the major limitations to conduct such studies was due to the resolution limits inherited with light microscopes. However, the emerge of super resolution microscopes, offers a promising tool to overcome this challenge. Here, we imply super resolution microscopy to examine the mechanism of ER&#945; transcriptional activity in the presence of estrogen as well as compounds that are currently used for endocrine therapy, Tamoxifen and Fulvestrant. We determine how each of these compounds influence ER&#945; interaction with its co-activators (P300, SRC-3), and its co-inhibitor (NCoRI), and how these interactions modulate chromatin activity. Obtaining such information of ER&#945; dynamics is critical to map the mechanism of its activity under different treatments, and thus is key to overcome some of the hurdles faced in endocrine therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c5a38649-101e-4ff1-a10a-8ae0781f0183\/@J03B8ZJA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Estrogen receptor,Hormone receptors,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16179"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tara Akhshi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myles Brown<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, we described altered expression of yes-associated protein (YAP1) (a paralog of TAZ) in prostate cancer. However, the expression and function of TAZ and its regulation in prostate cancer is not well characterized. In the present study, we profiled expression patterns of TAZ in clinical data sets of PCa and evaluated the effects of PDEF on TAZ phosphorylation in prostate cancer (PCa) cells in culture.<br \/><b>Material &#38; Method:<\/b> We analyzed the publicly available PCa datasets through Ualcan and c-Bioportal webservers. We transfected prostate cancer PC3 cells with PDEF or respective vector control. Protein levels of TAZ were analyzed by western blotting. Global changes in gene expression were analyzed using Affymetrix arrays followed by Gene Set Enrichment analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our analysis of publicly available PCa patient data in TCGA dataset, revealed a significant increase in TAZ mRNA levels in prostate cancer tissues as compared to normal prostate tissues (p=4.95E-08). Furthermore, we also found a significant gradual increase in TAZ mRNA expression during disease progression and metastasis. Our analysis of data sets in c-Bio portal revealed that patients with neuroendocrine PCa harbor much higher levels of TAZ mRNA as compared to CRPC phenotype. We also observed a negative correlation between PDEF and TAZ expression in CRPC\/NEPC data set. We observed that the PC3 cells transfected with PDEF (PDEF-PC3) showed an increased phospho-TAZ as compared to the respective PC3 vector control (VC-PC3) suggesting that PDEF plays a critical role in modulating TAZ activity an important effector in Hippo signaling.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These results provide first direct demonstration of elevated expression of TAZ in PCa, suggesting potential role of TAZ in prostate cancer. We also show for the first time increased TAZ phosphorylation in PCa cells by PDEF.

The sustained overactivation of NRF2 has been observed in many different types of human malignancy, conferring an advantage for growth and survival of cancer cells. Peptidyl-prolyl <i>cis<\/i>-<i>trans<\/i> isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) recognizes phosphorylated serine or threonine of a target protein and isomerizes the adjacent proline residue, thereby altering the structure, stability, and function of target proteins. We identified the three specific serine residues (Ser215, 408, and 577) present in NRF2, each of which precedes proline and undergoes phosphorylation. This prompted us to investigate whether PIN1 could bind to NRF2 and thereby influence its stability. For this purpose, we initially co-transfected HEK293T cells with expression vectors for GST-PIN1 and HA-tagged wild-type Nrf2 or non-phosphorylatable mutant constructs (NRF2<sup>S215A<\/sup>, NRF2<sup>S408A<\/sup>, and NRF2<sup>S577A<\/sup>). Notably, there was the most pronounced ubiquitination with concomitant degradation of NRF2 in cells harbouring NRF2<sup>S215A<\/sup> which was associated with abrogation of its interaction with PIN1. We then investigated the clinical relevance of NRF2 and PIN1 interaction to breast cancer progression. Immunofluorescence analysis of tissue microarrays (90 breast cancer tissues and 10 adjacent normal ones) revealed much higher (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001) expression of both NRF2 and PIN1 in the invasive ductal carcinomas than in normal tissues, which correlated with disease stages. The overexpression of NRF2 and PIN1 in breast cancer patients was also confirmed by immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses. Next, we compared the co-localization as well as expression of NRF2 and PIN1 in the two molecular subtype tissues (140 each). Both expression and co-localization of NRF2 and PIN1 were significantly higher (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001) in more aggressive TNBC than in the luminal type tissues. We also detected the significantly elevated levels of the Pin1-Nrf2 complex formed in human breast cancer specimens, compared with those in adjacent normal tissues. Silencing of Pin1 reduced the nuclear accumulation of NRF2 which was attributable to enhanced ubiquitination. The cycloheximide pulse-chase assay unravelled a significantly faster degradation of pre-existing NRF2 in PIN1-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells, corroborating the stabilization of NRF2 protein by PIN1. To explore the regulation of NRF2 by PIN1 and their interaction <i>in vivo<\/i>, we inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells into male BALB\/c nude mice. Tumors derived from PIN1 knockdown cells displayed markedly reduced levels of NRF2. In conclusion, stabilization of NRF2 through direct interaction with PIN1 may provide a novel mechanism underlying their cooperative role in breast cancer growth and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b9ae3bc8-1276-4c8f-a568-e0da715de57a\/@J03B8ZJA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nrf2,Protein-protein interactions,PIN1,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21444"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Soma Saeidi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Su-Jung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanymee N Guillen-Quispe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Achanta Sri Venkata Jagadeesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young-Joon Surh<\/i><\/presenter>.
