[{"Abstract":"Adhesion-regulating molecule 1 (ADRM1) is a polyubiquitin receptor on the 26S proteasome. ADRM1 is upregulated in many cancers. In this study, we evaluated the potential prognostic and predictive value of ADRM1 in breast cancer patients. We determined the expression of ADRM1 and its relationship to breast cancer subtypes, using the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset that contained racial and clinical outcomes data totaling 1108 patients. The ADRM1 mRNA expression levels were divided into quartiles to designate the ADRM1 high versus low expression designation. Karanam et. al developed an orally available proteasome inhibitor bis-benzylidine piperidone (RA190), that binds to the ubiquitin receptor RPN13\/ADRM1 on the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome and directly kills cancer cells by triggering proteotoxic stress. RA190 binds to cysteine 88 of ADRM1\/RPN13, triggering rapid accumulation of high-molecular-weight poly-ubiquitinated proteins resulting in apoptosis. Up284 is one of a second generation of small molecules that mimic RA190 activity. The objective of this study is to verify the role of ubiquitin receptor RPN13\/ADRM1 in metastatic breast cancer samples of European American and African American patients and identify the safe combination of regimens of bortezomib in combination with Up289 to mitigate recurrence, metastasis and reduce mortality in AA TNBC\/QNBC. Clinically, this will reveal a new, hitherto unknown targeted regimen for AA QNBC. From the biological perspective, it will provide insights into the underlying molecular changes that are associated with health disparities. Currently available treatments are unable to eradicate metastatic breast cancer specifically those classified as QNBC. Our preliminary analysis of Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicated that ADRM1 expression is highly expressed in AA versus EA breast cancer patients, resulting in a worse overall survival. Further analysis of ADRM1 in QNBC patients indicated that it was significantly elevated predominantly in African American patients with QNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f292fe32-3e3e-4034-a552-6d711350ae4b\/@s03B8ZJC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16185"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher Andrews Jr.<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clayton Yates<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Balasubramanyam Karanam<\/i><\/presenter>.

Biological pathways and predictive markers for recurrence remain understudied. Further, NPC tumors are associated with an intense inflammatory infiltrate, masking gene expression signals from the tumor epithelial compartment. We perform laser-capture microdissection on a preliminary cohort of 12 tumors, including primary tumors from recurrent and non-recurrent cases matched for stage of disease. Smart-3SEQ, a novel 3&#8217; end RNA-Seq technique which allows for the accurate quantification of transcript abundance in FFPE samples, was performed to obtain gene expression libraries. Tumor epithelial and microenvironment regions from were separately microdissected, giving a total of 42 histologically-pure gene expression libraries. Raw reads were mapped to the human hg19 and EBV genomes and gene expression counts were obtained with Subread. Differential gene expression and gene set enrichment was performed in R with DESeq2 and fgsea respectively. We observed that primary NPC tumors that did not recur were significantly enriched for immune processes, including leukocyte mediated immunity, innate immune response and lymphocyte activation (padj &#60; 1E-9 for all). The top differentially expressed genes in this group included mediators of inflammation such as STAT1 (padj = 0.0204). Critically, these gene expression changes were observed within the tumor epithelial compartment. In contrast, primary NPC tumors that eventually recurred were enriched for known oncogenes including BCL2 (padj = 0.000420). These findings suggest that heterogeneity in gene expression between NPC tumors play an important role in treatment response. Further work to define gene expression subtypes of NPC tumors will be helpful for patient stratification and personalized care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b009497-0f49-4b2c-ac4d-7f5a39446209\/@s03B8ZJC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),Gene expression profiling,Laser capture microdissection,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16186"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joshua Tay<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Keat Teo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chuan Keng Goh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bing Cheng Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kwok Seng Loh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Relationship between Erb-B2 positivity and patient tumor characteristics was assessed for Overall Survival (OS) and Relapse-Free Survival (RFS) by Kaplan-Meier method. Based on the intensity of stain with a polyclonal antibody (A485, 1\/400 dilution), cases with markedly intense cytoplasmic and membranous immunoreactivity were classified as Erb-B2 over-expressors. Erb-B2 was overexpressed in 13 (12%) cases. The mean age of the patients was 56 years (range 18-84 years). The patient population consisted of 64 Stage I and II, Early Stage (ES) and 36 cases with Stage III and IV Advanced Stage (AS). Data on histologic grade was available in 81 cases. 58 patients received platinum-containing regimen, 13 melphalan, and in 9 cases combination chemotherapy. Erb-B2 expression did not influence OS and RFS in these patients. Similarly, there was no significant relation to OS and RFS between Erb-B2 and age, grade, and patients with No Evidence of Disease (NED). Of the 64 cases with ES disease, 16 cases had Grade 2 tumor with Erb-B2 over-expression in 4 cases. Grade 2 tumors with Erb-B2 overexpression indicated significant relationship to OS and RFS, p=0.01, (median = 30 months, CI: 26 - 68) and p=0.05, (median = 15 months, CI: 13 - 68). Furthermore, in 21 cases with ES, Endometrioid histology and Erb-B2 expressors 6\/21 (28%) experienced significantly shorter OS compared to non-expressors p=0.005, (median = 48 months, CI: 22 - 74) (mean = 134 months, CI: 124 - 144). In conclusion, Erb-B2 overexpression could be detected in only limited EOC cases in PET and appears to have no prognostic influence. Additionally, endometrioid carcinoma and grade 2, ES certainly reflect the importance of sub-group analysis. In ovarian carcinoma distribution of stage, histology, and grading of tumor cells are conventional markers for prognosis. Finally, Erb-B2 status detected by immunohistochemistry, in a subgroup of patients with high-degree of HER2 positivity\/focal amplification may likely have better clinical outcome with anti-HER2 agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5bc89464-480b-4340-bb99-5ffa11cd9c46\/@s03B8ZJC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Prognosis,Expression,ErbB2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16187"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kavitha Advikolanu Rao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Magliocco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Maksymiuk<\/i><\/presenter>.

The molecular mechanisms of thyroid cancer, which develops as a result of environmental and genetic factors, are still unclear. SOX family genes are transcription factors that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and play a role in the developmental processes. SRY-box transcription factor 15 (SOX15) is an important member of the SOX family and is involved in carcinogenesis. Its downregulation has been associated with the development and progression of different human malignancies. Some SOX family members have been reported to control cell proliferation by acting as negative regulators of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway. MYC, CCND1 and CTNNB1 genes are important components of the Wnt signaling pathway. Recently, we have shown that epigenetic silencing of the SOX15 gene is associated with the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma,In the present study, to further the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SOX15 in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) we investigated SOX15 expression in association with the transcriptional targets of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway.Primary thyroid tumors and adjacent nonmalignant tissue samples were collected from 52 patients, prior to any treatment. Total RNA was isolated from tissue samples and reverse transcription was performed. Expression levels of the <i>SOX15, CTNNB1, c-MYC<\/i> and <i>CCND1 <\/i>genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR using the SYBR green and Light-Cycler 480 system (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). <i>&#946;2M<\/i> was used as the reference to normalize the mRNA levels. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 21.0 (IBM&#174; SPSS&#174; Statistics, IBM Corporation Somers, NY, USA) program.<i>SOX15<\/i> gene expression was significantly downregulated in 64.6% of PTC tissues compared to their normal counterparts. In contrast, <i>CCND1, CTNNB1<\/i> and <i>c-MYC<\/i> gene expressions were significantly upregulated in 70.2%, 60% and 57.8% of the patients. Among the group of patients with downregulated <i>SOX15<\/i> expression <i>CCND1, CTNNB1<\/i> and c<i>-MYC<\/i> expression were upregulated in 46.8%, 40% and 40% of the subjects, respectively. Our data suggest that <i>SOX15<\/i> downregulation may contribute to activation of Wnt signaling and provides further evidence indicating involvement of <i>SOX15<\/i> in modulating the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway in thyroid carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Wnt signaling,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16188"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ayse Nur Buyru<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ay&#351;egul Soysal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmet Ozayd&#305;n<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Betul Seyhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soykan Ar&#305;kan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nejat Dalay<\/i><\/presenter>.

Conventional MCL (cMCL) subtype is characterized by high aggressiveness and poor outcome with frequent relapses after initial response to treatment, suggesting the presence of a population of cancer stem cells (CSC) able to self-renew and responsible for drug resistance. SOX11 embryonic transcription factor is aberrantly overexpressed mostly in cMCL and has an oncogenic role in MCL. MCL-CSC have been isolated from MCL cases by different groups. However, its relationship to SOX11 expression and contribution to MCL clinical features and aggressive behavior remains unknown. We hypothesized that SOX11 may promote stem cell-like properties through the activation of stem cell-related genes, leading to an aggressive and incurable tumor in MCL patients. Here, we integrated the differential gene expression profile (GEP) between SOX11+ and SOX11- MCL primary cases with stem cell-related genes, and specific SOX11 ChIP-chip and epigenetic data in MCL cell lines and primary cases, to identify potential mediators of CSC directly regulated by SOX11 in MCL. We observed an enrichment of hematopoietic (HSC) and leukemic stem cells (LSC) gene signatures in SOX11+ compared to SOX11- MCL primary cases. MSI2, an RNA binding protein that maintains self-renewal and prevents differentiation in HSC, emerged as one of the most significant upregulated CSC-related gene in SOX11+ compared to SOX11- MCLs, positively correlating with SOX11 expression in MCL primary cases. Our in vitro experiments showed that SOX11 binds to MSI2 regulatory regions increasing its expression in MCL cells. MSI2 enhancers located in intronic regions were activated in SOX11+ but not in SOX11- MCL cell lines and primary cases. MSI2 upregulation significantly associated with poor overall survival, independently of common risk factors (SOX11 expression, high copy number alterations, 17p\/<i>TP53,<\/i> 11q\/<i>ATM<\/i> and 9p\/<i>CDKN2A<b> <\/b><\/i>alterations), in MCL patients. MSI2 knockdown MCL cell lines had a gene expression profile enriched in proapoptotic-related genes; whereas HSC and LSC gene signatures were downregulated compared to its control cells. MSI2 knockdown or MSI2 inhibition with Ro 08-2750 treatment decreased clonogenic growth, tumor survival and chemoresistance in MCL cells. SOX11+\/MSI2 high MCL primary leukemic samples showed higher percentage of ALDH+ cells compared to SOX11-\/MSI2 low samples, which decreased after Ro 08-2750 treatment. Besides, MSI2 silencing delayed tumor growth in vivo in MCL xenograft mice models. Overall, our results suggest that SOX11+ MCL cases acquire stemness features through the upregulation of MSI2 expression, which promotes chemoresistance, self-renewal and tumor survival. MSI2 represents a novel biomarker for MCL-CSC and therapeutic target for relapsed MCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5477b946-7ed0-4b87-9152-be47f6c491fc\/@s03B8ZJC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mantle cell lymphoma,MSI2,SOX11,Cancer stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16189"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marta Sureda-Gómez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Balsas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta Leonor Rodríguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ferran Nadeu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna De Bolòs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Álvaro Eguileor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta Kulis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giancarlo Castellano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>José Ignacio Martin-Subero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santiago Demajo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pedro Jares<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Giné<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elias Campo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virginia Amador<\/i><\/presenter>.

These aberrant splicing events can sometimes be explained by mutations in splice sites or splicing factors. However, the majority of mis-splicing in cancers remains unexplained. We hypothesize that oncogenic signaling pathways play a role in regulating alternative splicing. In this study, we focus on mRNA splicing activity regulated by the Ras signaling cascade, which is frequently mutated in cancers. These pathways offer avenues for therapeutic modulation through small molecule inhibitors.We took a global proteomic and transcriptomic approach to study the effects of oncogenic Ras signaling on RNA splicing in vitro. Specifically, we performed LC-MS\/MS and RNA-seq profiling on normal human lung airway epithelial (AALE) cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant KRAS or RIT1 (N = 3 replicates per allele). Phosphorylation of splicing factors was preferentially downregulated in KRASmut cells compared to KRASWT cells, suggesting that oncogenic KRAS signaling regulates splicing factor activity. Additionally, of the 2227 and 2452 skipped exon (SE) events in KRASG12V and KRASQ61H cells, respectively, compared to KRASWT overexpressing cells, 1013 events were shared between the two mutants. This statistically significant overlap (p &#60; 0.001, hypergeometric test) indicates that KRAS has a role in splicing regulation that is disrupted when the protein is mutated.\u0009To determine how KRAS-regulated splicing activity compared to other signaling proteins and oncogenes, we also profiled the whole transcriptomes of isogenic A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines overexpressing 86 wild-type or variant alleles across 27 genes implicated in lung cancers (N = 4 to 8 replicates per allele). Of all pairs of mutant and wild-type alleles tested, KRASmut cells compared to KRASWT overexpressing cells exhibited the second highest levels of alternative splicing, behind only RNA binding protein RBM45 and its mutant allele RBM45M126I. In particular, ten SE events were observed to be differentially regulated in a KRAS dependent manner in both AALE and A549 cells. One of these 10 events is the differential splicing of the Myc Associated Zinc Finger (MAZ) protein to increase the expression of its splice variant that acts as a negative regulator of transcription. As MAZ regulates expression of KRAS, this splice variant may be a mechanism for the cell to modulate wild-type KRAS levels in the presence of KRAS mutants.\u0009Our proteomic and transcriptomic profiling in lung epithelial and lung adenocarcinoma cells uncovers splicing factor activity and mRNA splicing events regulated by oncogenic KRAS. With further studies of the alternative splicing events described, it will be possible to design or repurpose therapies in order to target aberrant splicing caused by disrupted Ras signaling and its downstream effectors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d3c335fa-f9c1-486c-8e1c-f0334fa0f245\/@s03B8ZJC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Alternative splicing,RNA sequencing,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16190"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>April Lo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria McSharry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alice H.

Though there has been progress towards understanding ovarian cancer pathogenesis, much is not yet understood about the molecular mechanisms that facilitate chemoresistance and metastasis. Our work has shown that nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) is highly active in several human cancers, though the role of NRF1 remains largely unexplored in ovarian carcinomas. Therefore, our aim was to examine the role of this transcription factor in ovarian cancer, since understanding its transcriptional landscape may reveal NRF1 or its target genes as possible therapeutic targets for this highly aggressive cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was utilized to collect RNA-Seq data from 379 serous cystadenocarcinoma samples, where we found that about 20% of ovarian cancer patients had altered NRF1 expression, showing either high expression or amplification of this transcription factor. Patients with high NRF1 expression were found to have decreased survival compared to patients with low NRF1 expression. NRF1 amplification was also correlated with the overamplification of one of its target genes - Jrk helix-turn-helix protein (JRK) in 26% of the samples. JRK regulates centrosome amplification, and through the production of mitotic spindle abnormalities, centrosome amplification contributes to genomic instability. Further investigation of the relationship between NRF1 and JRK uncovered that protein levels of JRK and &#946;-catenin were significantly higher in NRF1-induced stem-like cells compared to the control group, and JRK is known to bind to &#946;-catenin. Our NRF1 ChIP-Seq analyses showed that promoters of these two genes - JRK and CTNNB1 - were bound to NRF1. The Flow Assorted Cell Sorting (FACS), ChIP-Seq, RNA Seq and confocal microscopic studies suggest that through JRK, NRF1 regulates &#946;-catenin transcriptional activity. Amplified gene expression is the one of the first steps towards oncogene activation, and our findings illustrate that altered NRF1 expression (i.e., overexpression or amplification) coupled with that of JRK influences the prognosis of patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway is also highly active in the aggressive ovarian cancer. In addition to JRK, through the activation of &#946;-catenin, NRF1may also affect the development of ovarian tumors. Taken together, our findings provide a novel insight into the molecular basis of the contribution of NRF1-driven JRK-mediated &#946;-catenin transcriptional activity to the susceptibility of highly aggressive ovarian cancer. A better understanding of how ovarian neoplasm formation depends on NRF1-JRK-&#946;-catenin pathway may open new avenues for therapeutic strategy against ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6c471359-05f4-4dea-879b-0ce27c327a6b\/@s03B8ZJC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),Wnt pathway,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),&#946;-catenin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16192"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ana Ruas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quentin Felty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayanta K.

We used primary, human pancreatic acinar cells to evaluate the transcriptional profile during the course of ADM. Following six days of culture on Matrigel, acinar cells underwent morphological and molecular changes reminiscent of ADM. RNA was sequenced from 14 donor&#8217;s paired pancreata (day 0 and 6 of culture). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering demonstrated complete separation of the gene expression profile between culture day 0 (acinar phenotype) and day 6 (ductal phenotype). By and large, acinar-specific genes were downregulated in the samples from day 6 ADM while ductal-specific genes were upregulated. Using a gene set enrichment approach, we identified regulons that are involved in regulating ADM including downregulated, acinar-associated transcription factors (including PTF1A, RBPJL, and XBP1) and upregulated, ductal- and progenitor-associated transcription factors (SOX11, SOX4, and YAP1). The expression of pancreatic cancer associated genes significantly correlated with the gene expression\/regulon activity observed in normal pancreas undergoing ADM. We reported a detail analysis of the transcriptional profile during human ADM. Our findings confirm that many ADM-related transcription factors and signaling pathways discovered in transgenic mouse models are applicable to human ADM and highlights the relevancy of in vitro models of pancreas plasticity using human tissue.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b448c20-8a9e-4c19-b9d1-8a2098b1499c\/@s03B8ZJC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenocarcinoma,Bioinformatics,Differential gene expression,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16193"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"a88ee921-3c62-4528-916b-b2b202f0348a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a88ee921-3c62-4528-916b-b2b202f0348a\/@s03B8ZJC\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Corey Melissa Perkins<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinmai Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hesamedin Hakimjavadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie K.

Recent development in single cell sequencing by combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq has made it possible to determine genome-wide linkages between chromatin accessibilities and gene expression.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To test the feasibility of using single cell multiome sequencing in dissecting regulatory linkages between chromatin accessibilities and gene expressions, we applied 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression platform to simultaneously encapsulate Tn5 transposase tagged nuclei from two prostate cell lines. We applied down-sampling linkage analysis to determine highly reproducible genome-wide associations between ATAC-seq peaks and RNA-seq gene expressions. To investigate the chromatin accessibilities related to human transcription factor binding sites, we scanned the JASPAR motif collection with genome-wide Tn5 insertion analysis.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>This study encapsulated 3,096 multiome RWPE-1 nuclei cultured in serum-free condition, 6,978 and 8,487 multiome LNCaP nuclei treated with methanol (LNCaP-M) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT, LNCaP-D). Our analysis captured 210,990, 264,802, and 278,154 ATAC-seq peaks from RWPE-1, LNCaP-M, and LNCaP-D by macs2 narrow peak model (FDR q&#60;0.01), which included over 90% peaks identified by bulk ATAC-seq datasets. Through downsampling linkage analysis, we identified 1,595, 2,507, and 4,183 linkage associations between ATAC-seq and RNA-seq from the above three experiments, respectively. Scatter plots showed that the correlation coefficient of the linkage association was negatively associated with the distance between ATAC-seq and RNA-seq signals. By comparing to bulk ChIP-seq data from RWPE-1 cells, we confirmed that the single cell ATAC-seq peaks in linkages were co-localized at histone modified regions, including H3K4me1 (25.7%), H3K27ac (14.3%), and H3K4me3 (4.9%). JASPAR database (634 motifs) search found that the Tn5 footprints surrounding AR, NR3C1, and NR3C2 motifs in LNCaP-D showed significantly higher enrichment than that of the LNCaP-M group, indicating increased androgen receptor DNA binding following DHT treatment. Interestingly, in RWPE-1 cells harboring TP53 p.P72R polymorphism (rs1042522), we found differential Tn5 footprints surrounding TP53 binding motif between its ATAC-seq subclusters at whole genome scale.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our preliminary data in prostate cell lines outlined a regulatory landscape of single-cell resolution.

Andrographolide (AG) is a labdane diterpenoid compound isolated from the medicinal plant <i>Andrographis paniculata.<\/i> Previous studies in our laboratory showed that Andrographolide decreased prostate tumor size in mice, induced expression of DNA repair genes associated with double-strand break repair and altered mitochondrial function. The objective of this study is to determine the role of AG in inflammation in prostate cancer. Microarray analysis of tumors treated with Andrographolide 10 mg\/kg and their vehicle were conducted. Tumors were developed using a xenograft model in which the prostates of SCID mice were injected with 22RV1, and mice were treated three times per week with Andrographolide 10 mg\/kg. Tumor tissues were collected and snap frozen. Gene expression was identified and analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip&#174; Human Gene 2.0 array. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) we found that Andrographolide 10 mg\/kg altered genes associated with inflammatory response such as ATM, DHFR, HIF-1-&#945;, CDKAL1, DHFR, NOX1, C5, CCL4, COG6, SUPT20H, CA5B, TTC3. To determine changes of cytokine expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells treated with 25 &#956;M Andrographolide, we used the Abcam Cytokine Antibody Array test&#174;. PC3 prostate cancer cells treated with Andrographolide showed altered expression of cytokines such as IL-2, TNF-&#945;, TNF-&#946;, EGF, IGF-1, ENA-78, GM-CSF, GRO, GRO-&#945;, I-309, and Angiogenin. These results showed that AG may alter the tumor microenvironment promoting the secretion of diverse cytokines that may inhibit tumor development.

Post-mortem liver sections from five fibrosis induction and five age-matched controls were harvested for RNA-seq (mRNA and lncRNA), small RNA-seq (miRNA), and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS; DNA methylation). Supervised, multi-omic analysis of the 5,000 genes and methylated regions demonstrating the largest inter-sample variance with non-zero counts along with all sequenced miRNA were analyzed using the DIABLO method within the mixOmics 6.8.5 R library.<br \/><b><u>Results:<\/u> <\/b>Single component DIABLO latent variable analysis of mRNAs, lncRNAs, miRNAs, and methylated regions was performed to identify the genetic elements (variables) which most reliably discriminated between experimental arms.

We have previously found that in MIBC, loss of STAG2 protein expression is associated with better overall survival (n=169; p=0.049) and progression free survival (n=169; p=0.016). Based on these retrospective analyses, we hypothesized that STAG2 promotes an aggressive cell phenotype through its genomic interactions and transcriptomic regulation in MIBC. First, to study the effects of STAG2 on gene expression, we stably knocked down (KD) STAG2 in T24 MIBC cells using two short hairpin RNAs. Scrambled shRNA served as a control in all experiments. Second, using KD and control T24 cell lines, we performed RNA and chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing, then integrated these results utilizing the Cistrome analysis algorithm (Wang, S. et al., 2013) to determine how STAG2 regulates gene expression at its genomic binding sites. STAG2 KD led to the differential expression of 2158 genes, with 648 overlapping between the two shRNA cell lines. Through Cistrome analysis, we discovered that genes with increased expression after STAG2 KD were enriched for STAG2 binding sites (p=0.000503), yet genes with decreased expression did not show significant enrichment (p=0.873). This suggests that STAG2 functions as a transcriptional repressor, and subsequently we focused on genes with increased expression after STAG2 KD. We identified the significantly upregulated gene Reelin (RELN) (log<sub>2<\/sub>FC=2.89, 1.86; p&#60;1*10<sup>-42<\/sup>, 1*10<sup>-17<\/sup> for each shRNA, respectively), which has a well-established role in cell migration and invasion. To investigate this <i>in vitro<\/i> in MIBC cells, we performed time lapse microscopy and invasion assays to quantitatively determine cell movement over time. Compared to controls, T24 cells with STAG2 KD had reduced displacement (78 vs 114 &#181;m, p&#60;0.05), speed (0.30 vs 0.41 &#181;m\/min, p&#60;0.05) and invasion (137 vs 190 cells\/field, p&#60;0.001) <i>in vitro<\/i>. Altogether, our results indicate that STAG2 functions as a transcriptional repressor and promotes movement and invasion of MIBC cells. This may explain why STAG2 protein loss leads to better outcomes for MIBC patients, and points to STAG2 protein expression as a potential prognostic biomarker. In our current work, we are utilizing a large drug screen of FDA-approved agents to identify vulnerabilities of tumor cells lacking STAG2. These studies will help to identify drugs that augment current standard of care and benefit the large proportion of patients with STAG2-mutant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6f8036f-24c5-46e6-be96-76835c3af478\/@t03B8ZJD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression analysis,Invasion,Transcriptional repression,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16201"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah R.

We recently showed that treating pancreatic cancer cells with gemcitabine, a standard-of-care chemotherapy for PDAC, increases expression of NE markers, suggesting that ductal to neuroendocrine lineage plasticity could play a role in drug resistance. NE features in prostate cancer have been previously associated with loss of the neuronal gene repressor RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor (REST); in the present study, we explore a potential role of REST in regulating NE differentiation in PDAC. Our experiments show that loss of REST in PDAC cells increases NE gene expression, gemcitabine resistance, and colony formation. RNA sequencing data from gemcitabine-treated PDAC cells were enriched for REST target genes, suggesting gemcitabine relieves REST-mediated repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments corroborated this by demonstrating that gemcitabine reduces REST binding to the NE genes SYP and SNAP25. In addition, single cell ATAC sequencing also uncovered a heterogeneous response to gemcitabine treatment, revealing two gemcitabine-driven cell states with differing REST motif accessibility. Our study indicates that REST controls NE gene programs in PDAC and that loss of REST promotes gemcitabine resistance and oncogenic growth. Mirroring the heterogeneity of PDAC tumors, a subset of PDAC cells treated with gemcitabine have reduced REST motif accessibility, which may reflect a therapy resistant NE-like subpopulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c102c730-9b91-4394-bc99-f38b5897c56a\/@t03B8ZJD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine differentiation,Neuroendocrine tumors,REST,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16203"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kevin Alexander MacPherson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meghan M.

This process, termed acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), is an important feature facilitating pancreas regeneration after injury. In the absence of oncogenic mutations, the ADM lesions resolve and reform the acinar compartment (adaptive ADM). However, in the presence of oncogenic <i>Kras<\/i> mutations (oncogenic ADM), acinar cells undergo neoplastic transformation after ADM and evolve to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), a well-known precursor of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We have characterized the role of Paired-Related Homeobox1 (PRRX1) in adaptive ADM. We demonstrated through our novel conditional <i>Prrx1<\/i> knock-out mouse model that loss of <i>Prrx1<\/i> abrogated ADM formation. Here we explore the relationship between <i>Prrx1<\/i> and mutant <i>Kras <\/i>on promoting ADM and a pro-ADM microenvironment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We generated novel<i> Pdx1-Cre;LSLKras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>;Prrx1<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>;Rosa26<sup>YFP\/YFP<\/sup><\/i> (KCY Prrx1 KO) mice, in which mutant <i>Kras<\/i> is efficiently expressed and <i>Prrx1<\/i> is deleted in a pancreas-specific manner. KCY Prrx1 WT and KO mice were sacrificed at 3 months and 5 months for histological analysis. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining for CK19, characterized for the rate of ADM formation and evaluated for F4\/80 and SMA. Quantification of ADM regions, F4\/80 and SMA was performed through automated cell-counting of immunofluorescence staining (IF). Dissociated acinar cell culture in collagen was utilized for the evaluation of ADM under <i>ex vivo<\/i> conditions.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> IF staining revealed that KCY Prrx1 KO mice had fewer ADM lesions compared to Prrx1 WT mice at 3 months. This difference became dramatically apparent at the 5 month timepoint. Additionally, lower areas of fibrosis were identified via H&#38;E staining in KCY Prrx1 KO mice, which was accompanied with lower F4\/80 and SMA positivity at both 3 months and 5 months. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> cultures also demonstrated significant reduction in ADM formation in the context of oncogenic <i>Kras<\/i> and loss of <i>Prrx1<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> PRRX1 can influence ADM formation in both a cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic manner in the presence of oncogenic KRAS. Our preliminary data suggest Prrx1 facilitates PDAC progression through PanIN formation. We will continue to investigate the mechanisms driving Prrx1-dependent ADM formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41c77815-f3db-41c3-b77c-20c2da16fa69\/@t03B8ZJD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Metaplasia,KRAS,PanIN,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16204"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alina L.

Due to their high cellular plasticity, these cancers often escape treatment through a trans-differentiation from adenocarcinoma to the neuroendocrine state. We previously developed a pan small cell cancer in vitro\/in vivo model named PARCB that can recapitulate this transition from primary patient tissues. To understand which transcription factors may be important in this transition, we conducted bulk and single cell RNA sequencing over time. We identified a developmental trajectory that is shared among all samples and is defined by stage-specific transcription factors. We plan to interrogate the role that these transcription factors play in the PARCB transformation assay. We performed ATAC sequencing to investigate how these transcription factors regulate these transitional states. Our study will provide a basic understanding of the transcriptional changes that occur during neuroendocrine differentiation and provide new potential therapeutic targets for small cell cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6ed09f10-9992-485e-8e8e-6f9b038cc228\/@t03B8ZJD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Neuroendocrine differentiation,Prostate cancer,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16205"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chia-Chun Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wendy Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Obusan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tyler Sugimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Sheu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donghui Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grigor Varuzhanyan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Ta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyuan Mao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathanael Bangayan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung-Wook Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Graerber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Owen Witte<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, adult acinar cells, the most probable origin of PDAC, are largely refractory to Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>-mediated oncogenic transformation in conditional mouse models. With the concomitant loss of transcription factors that regulate acinar cell differentiation, such as Pdx1 (Pancreatic and Duodenal Homeobox 1), acinar cells undergo a rapid cell identity switch, the so-called acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). Consequently, Pdx1 knockout mice present with massively accelerated tumor formation. How loss of cell identity cooperates with oncogenic Kras to induce pancreatic transformation is largely unclear.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To elucidate mechanisms that accelerate the cellular reprogramming after loss of acinar differentiation, conditional Pdx1 knockout animals were analyzed. By performing single-cell ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using <i>sequencing<\/i>) from frozen bulk tissue, genome-wide chromatin accessibility states were captured at different stages of carcinogenesis. Changes in the epigenome were correlated to RNA-seq data. Moreover, expression of differentially regulated genes was validated by RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> While sole expression of Kras<sup>G12D <\/sup>in adult acinar cells induces only a few transcriptional and epigenetic changes, loss of the acinar differentiation factor Pdx1 leads to a previously unidentified switch of acinar cell identity. Notably, the chromatin profiles of Pdx1 knockout acinar cells, despite appearing phenotypically normal, show a striking similarity to ADM cells. One of the most differentially regulated genes in acinar cells from wild type versus Pdx1 knockout mice is <i>Ror2<\/i>. As a mediator of the non-canonical Wnt signaling, Ror2 regulates essential signaling pathways, such as Ras-MAPK signaling. Pdx1 knockout acinar cells exhibit a high accessibility of the gene, while it is repressed in Pdx1 wild type cells. Moreover, gene expression is significantly increased in Pdx1 knockout mice. To test if Ror2 is a potential regulator of pancreatic carcinogenesis, immunostaining of pancreatic cancer tissues from Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;p53<sup>mut <\/sup>(KPC) mice and human PDAC specimens was performed. Staining revealed Ror2 expression in a subset of neoplasms, suggesting a distinct subtype of early lesions.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data reveal that the loss of the acinar differentiation factor Pdx1 leads to massive alterations in the transcriptome and epigenome of acinar cells, significantly accelerating Kras-dependent pancreatic carcinogenesis. In-depth sequencing and molecular analyses identified de-regulation of the receptor kinase Ror2, an important mediator of multiple intracellular signaling pathways, which we hypothesize cooperates with Kras<sup>G12D <\/sup>to induce and promote pancreatic carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7c0da5c8-c4c9-4f4d-be8e-75dae0cf4e4a\/@t03B8ZJD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Transcriptional regulation,Single cell,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16206"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Simone Benitz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Loveless<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malak Nasser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui-Ju Wen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Long<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacee Moore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erick Davis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Straub<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivonne Regel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filip Bednar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Howard Crawford<\/i><\/presenter>.
