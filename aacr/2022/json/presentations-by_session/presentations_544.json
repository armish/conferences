[{"Abstract":"<b>Objective:<\/b> Endometrial cancer is a common gynecologic malignancy, yet carcinogenesis remains elusive. Evidence showed that aberrant genomic methylation profiling contributes to the development of endometrial cancer. G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1), a membrane-associated estrogen receptor, was reported to play a multifaceted role in tumors. Its function in endometrial cancer is little known. Here, we conducted an integrated analysis of RNA expression, DNA methylation, and somatic mutations data from TCGA to investigate GPER1 upstream regulator and its influence in endometrial cancer biological process.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and clinical information of endometrial cancer (n=554) and normal control (n=33) were obtained from TCGA database. RNA-seq profiles of GPER1 low and high groups were analyzed by R 4.1.0 software. KEGG and GSEA based on GPER1 expression were conducted. Correlation analysis of GPER1 and genomic instability were displayed. G1, the GPER1 agonist, was added to observe cell viability and metastatic ability in vitro. DNA methylation data was analyzed.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> GPER1 expression was decreased in endometrial cancer compared with normal tissues. GPER1 was associated with poor overall survival (HR=0.52, p=0.003) (Figure 1). Low expression group showed a more frequent mutation landscape, higher tumor mutation burden (TMB), and micro-satellite instability (MSI) (Figure 2). Several hypermethylation loci on GPER1 CpG island were revealed. Methylation status is negatively correlative to RNA expression of GPER1 (Figure 3). P-value &#60;0.05 and log2FC &#62;1.5, 473 up-regulated and 114 down-regulated genes were screened. Up-regulated DEGs enriched in the Estrogen signaling pathway, Endometrial cancer, wnt signaling pathway, etc. Down-regulated DEGs enriched in Cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, etc. (Figure 4). GSEA analysis showed that GPER1 low expression group was enriched in several biological processes including cell cycle checkpoint, Recombinational repair, etc. G1 inhibited endometrial cancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, and reduced cell metastatic ability (Figure 5).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> GPER1 exhibited decreased expression in endometrial cancer and DNA hypermethylation in promoter CpG island locus. The low GPER1 expression group showed prominent genomic instability. GPER1 agonists inhibit endometrial cancer cell growth and<br \/>metastasis, which may serve as a therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/edc98091-8025-4b60-9d7d-1154ad1c191b\/@y03B8ZSD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Methylation abnormality,Genetic instability,GPER1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17835"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xuan Feng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ting Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boqiang Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiaqi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangyang Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingyi Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianliu Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

A double strand break (DSB) in DNA can have deleterious consequences for a cell, which if not repaired faithfully, can lead to mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, or even cell death. DSBs can be processed by several DNA repair pathways, of which homologous recombination (HR) is the preferred method due to its error-free nature. HR uses an intact homologous DNA sequence as a template for recovering the information lost at the break site. A significant proportion of all cancers, especially triple-negative breast, ovarian pancreatic and prostate cancers, have loss of function alterations affecting genes involved in HR-mediated DNA repair. Alternate repair pathways operate when HR is defective in tumors, but the pathways operative in this context remain a matter of contention. Previous work <i>in vivo<\/i> in yeast and <i>in vitro<\/i> systems has established a new role of RNA in DNA repair. Owing to its abundance in the cell and its sequence similarity to parental DNA, we sought to define whether RNA can act as a template for the repair of DSBs in human cells. We developed a novel high throughput assay to test if DNA breaks can be repaired using RNA as an alternative template in mammalian cells. Human cells were transfected with a guide RNA cloned in a Cas9 expression vector to generate a site-specific DSB at the AAVS1 locus, a safe harbour, in the human genome. Furthermore, a donor template in the form of DNA or RNA (homologous to the DSB locus) containing a unique mutational signature was provided at the time of transfection. The unique mutational signature enables us to determine if the donor has been utilized as a template for DNA repair. Using this assay, we demonstrate that cells can use a spliced RNA transcript as a functional template to repair a DSB. We have identified that Rev3L, a key component of the translesion synthesis polymerase Pol Zeta (&#950;), has a novel reverse-transcriptase activity in human cells and can help repair the DSB using RNA as a template. Further characterization of this repair pathway and its associated mutational scar will provide new insights into the mutational signatures seen in HR-defective cancers, enabling a better understanding of the DNA repair pathways upregulated in these tumours. The proposed studies could help prioritize novel therapeutic approaches by exploiting synthetic lethality in HR-deficient cancers as well as HR-proficient cancers when used in combinatorial cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd7144e9-44f5-4192-8559-384286fa1780\/@y03B8ZSD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair,Genomic instability,RNA,DNA double-strand break,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17838"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manisha Jalan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juber Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyrie S Olsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sana Ahmed-Seghir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel S Higginson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge S Reis-Filho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadeem Riaz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon N Powell<\/i><\/presenter>.

The median tumor mutational burden (TMB) of this cohort was 4 muts\/Mb (0-43.9 muts\/Mb), and 4.1% (11\/269) of patients displayed high TMB (defined as &#8805; 10 muts\/Mb). HRR pathway gene mutations were detected in 90\/269 patients (33.46%). The most frequently altered genes were BAP1(13.4%), ARID1A (5.2%), BRCA1 (3.72%), ATM (3.35%), and BRCA2 (1.86%). Truncation (23.05%) was the most common mutation type. 4.46% (12\/269) of patients carried HRR-related germline mutations, and the most frequently mutated germline genes were RAD51C\/D (33.33%,4\/9) and BRCA (16.67%, 2\/9). Patients with HRR pathway gene mutations were found to have a significantly higher TMB (median, 4.45 vs. 4 muts\/Mb, p &#60; 0. 05). We additionally identified that mutations in HRR pathways were significantly associated with decreased relapse-free survival (RFS)( p &#60; 0.05). The 3-year RFS rate of the HRR-mutated group was significantly lower than the negative group (78.8% vs.90.6%, p&#60;0.01).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>HRR gene alterations, associated with increased recurrence, occurred at a high frequency of 33.46% in Chinese ccRCC patients.

AKR1C3 is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cells, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and leukemia cells. This study is to investigate the <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity of TFX05-01, a selective AKR1C3-activated anticancer prodrug, in preclinical models of AKR1C3 overexpressing cells. The studies provide solid foundation for nomination of TFX05-01 for clinical trials.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> Enzymatic activation of TFX05-01 was investigated <i>in vitro<\/i> using recombinant human AKR1C3. Cellular anti-proliferative activity was evaluated with a range of AKR1C3 overexpressed or low expressed cell lines. The <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity was evaluated in various CDX mouse models with high expression of AKR1C3, including HepG2 and castration-resistant prostate VCaP, as well as PDX leukemia models<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> TFX05-01 is a prodrug which selectively releases a DNA alkylating agent (TFX05-01A) upon exposure to AKR1C3. TFX05-01 inhibited cell proliferation in several AKR1C3 overexpressed HCC cell lines with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#8804; 100 nM. In contrast, TFX05-01 showed much lower anti-proliferative activity in low or no AKR1C3 expressed cells with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value greater than 1 &#956;M. The cytotoxic potency of TFX05-01 in cancer cells correlates with the level of AKR1C3 expression, and the cytotoxic activity of TFX05-01 was inhibited when used in combination with a specific AKR1C3 inhibitor (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 0.7 nM without inhibitor vs 188 nM with inhibitor in SNU-878 cells). TFX05-01 showed antitumor efficacy in AKR1C3 highly expressed HepG2 subcutaneously implanted xenograft model (TGI = 97% @2 mpk, QW, 3 doses IV). Concomitant PK studies showed that the concentration of active metabolites (TFX05-01A) in tumor was significantly higher (15~50 times) than that in plasma, which correlates with the selective release of the active DNA alkylating agent upon exposure to AKR1C3 in tumor tissues.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b> TFX05-01 is a novel selective AKR1C3-activated prodrug, which is different from traditional non-selective alkylating agents for cancer therapy. Preclinical studies have shown profound <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of TFX05-01 in AKR1C3 overexpressed mouse tumor xenograft models without marked toxicity. TFX05-01 represents a novel treatment option for AKR1C3 expressing solid cancers.

The reason underlying the strong tissue-specificity for BRCA-associated cancer risk remains largely unknown. Under the two-hit hypothesis, BRCA-mediated oncogenesis is thought to originate from a cell where the germline <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> variant underwent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wildtype <i>BRCA<\/i> allele, resulting in homologous recombination DNA repair deficiencies. Notably, tumor aneuploidy and loss of chromosome arms also show strong tissue specificity across cancer types. The apparent tissue specificities of BRCA-associated cancer risk and chromosome aneuploidy, together with deletion-induced LOH underlying the two-hit hypothesis, pose an intriguing possibility that they may be linked. Using genomic data from the TCGA PanCanAtlas and ICGC PCAWG projects, we calculated the frequencies of deletions of the chromosomal arms where the <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> genes are located (17q for <i>BRCA1<\/i>; 13q for <i>BRCA2<\/i>) across different cancer types in tumors with no whole-genome doublings (WGD). Among TCGA cases, OV and BRCA showed significantly higher frequencies of 17q deletion (32.75% and 8.05%, respectively) than other cancer types (ranked 2\/30 and 5\/30, permutation p-value = 0.030 and 0.024), and relatively higher frequencies of 13q deletion (32.75% and 21.92%, respectively) compared to other cancers (ranked 5\/32 and 8\/32, p-value = 0.101 and 0.078). As expected, cancer types showing high fractions of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> deletions overlap with those showing 17q\/13q deletions and often include BRCA and OV. Subsequently, we determined how often <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> deletion co-occurred and thus may be caused by the corresponding 17q\/13q deletions, showing that <i>BRCA1<\/i> deletion carriers who also had chr17q deletion accounted for 40.76% in OV and 25.93% in BRCA patients, compared to 33.33% in all other cancer types while <i>BRCA2<\/i> deletion carriers who also had chr13q deletion accounted for OV (53.97%) and BRCA (58.60%) patients, compared to 49.83% in all other cancer types. In addition, we validated our findings in non-overlapping cases of the ICGC PCAWG projects. Consistent with TCGA results, OV and BRCA showed higher frequencies of 17q and 13q deletion compared to other cancer types. To conclude, we identified a correlation between cross-cancer difference in arm-level and focal chromosome aneuploidy affecting <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> and <i>BRCA<\/i>-associated cancer risk, and how chromosome aneuploid may give rise to tissue-specific risks of cancer remain to be investigated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cb247298-3c28-4d4f-af42-249f27c40fbb\/@z03B8ZSE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number variation,BRCA,Chromosomal aneuploidy,Tissue specificity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18777"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xinfeng Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomi Jun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kuan-lin Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

There is a long latency period of more than 40 years between asbestos exposure and disease presentation, highlighting an unknown evolutionary trajectory. Throughout the latent years, different somatic structural alterations are acquired by the growing tumour. To elucidate this evolutionary path, we conducted multiregional whole exome sequencing (WES) of 106 samples (5 or 4 regions per tumour and a matched blood sample) for 20 patients as part of the MEDUSA study (Mesothelioma evolution: Drugging somatic alterations). Gene fusions have been shown to have a clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic significance i.e., the driver fusion EM4-ALK expressed in a minority of peritoneal mesotheliomas. Previous descriptions of gene fusions in MPM have mostly been limited to isolated case reports, with the only genome-wide assessment study identifying fusion events involving known MPM genes including <i>NF2<\/i> and <i>BAP1<\/i>. Therefore, our aim was to identify potential truncal inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements generating gene fusions that occurred early in the evolutionary history of the tumour. We used two software tools - Meerkat (v.0.189) and Delly (v0.8.7), to identify gene fusion events in the regional tumour sites for a given patient. We identified tumour-specific events by filtering against the calls made on exome sequence from the matched blood of each patient. Finally, we identified truncal gene fusion events as ones observed across all regional samples of a particular patient. We validated the gene fusions by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the breakpoint junctions. Further work was carried out to identify truncal fusion transcripts at the transcriptomic level using RNA sequencing data (Arriba v2.1.0) and compare the gene fusion predictions detected at the genomic level made by WES. We found a total of 24 truncal fusion events, 3 of which were novel (FMO9P-OR2W5, <i>GBA3<\/i> and <i>SP9<\/i>). Tumour suppressor genes involved included (<i>BAP1, MTAP, and LRP1B<\/i>). Oncogenic fusions involved (CACNA1D-ERC2). In addition to this, our analysis revealed truncal copy number neutral events such as in-frame PARD3B-NT5DC2 and out of frame STAB2-NT5DC2. Moreover, with transcriptome sequencing we characterised the fusion transcripts events initially detected by WES (i.e. fusions involving <i>AHRR<\/i> and <i>B3GAL2<\/i> genes). Our findings suggest that gene fusions events occur during early evolution with marked heterogeneity across the cohort (no recurrent truncal fusions event were observed in a subset). Some truncal fusion events are likely to be drivers of cancer progression, as they involve mesothelioma associated genes (e.g. <i>MTAP<\/i> and <i>BAP1<\/i>). The role of other gene fusions remains unclear, and larger studies are needed to clarify whether somatic rearrangements of these genes are involved in tumour progression in MPM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f19df70c-3d83-4a21-838d-b210516d1bfa\/@z03B8ZSE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Mesothelioma,Chromosomal instability,Tumor biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18778"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maymun Jama<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edward J Hollox<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Apostolos Nakas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee Brannan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Dawson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Dudbridge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dean Fennell<\/i><\/presenter>.

The MSI-High (MSI-H) phenotype is prevalent in Lynch Syndrome, caused by the inheritance of MMR loss-of-function alleles as well as in 15% of all colorectal cancers. Accurate, timely detection of MSI is important for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapies that take advantage of increased expression of neoantigens in MSI-H tumors. The Pillar oncoReveal MSI Panel is a targeted NGS assay comprised of a single-tube multiplex PCR-based chemistry and companion Pillar Variant Analysis Toolkit (PiVAT) software with MSIsensor-based detection of tumor MSI status. We report the accuracy of the PiVAT MSI module in detection of tumor MSI status without the need for a matched normal comparator.<br \/>Methods: 56 pairs of clinical tumor and matched normal FFPE samples were analyzed using the oncoReveal MSI Panel. MSI status was verified by a standard MSI detection method. Illumina sequencing was performed using a PE2x150 protocol. PiVAT determines MSI status using MSIsensor. Call performance on Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) BAM files was compared with PiVAT&#8217;s paired-end assembled and filtered BAM files (PBAM). In both cases coverage normalization and FDR thresholds were set to 1. In a second experiment, 88 clinical normal tissue samples were combined with the matched tumor\/normal samples and analyzed using the PiVAT MSI module&#8217;s unmatched calling protocol using a synthetic pooled normal.<br \/>Results: MSI was first assessed in matched tumor\/normal samples using MSIsensor. Preliminary analyses revealed a greater separation of MSI scores between MSI-positive and -negative tumors when MSIsensor was run on PBAM vs BWA-generated BAM files. Due to high individual variability at MS sites, MSI detection is difficult for tumor samples with no available matched normal tissue. Hierarchical clustering demonstrated that a subset of MS sites exhibited low variability between normal samples and showed large differences between MSI-H tumor, and MS stable (MSS) tumor and\/or normal samples when compared to a pooled normal baseline. Analyses based on the full target set did not accurately detect differences between MSI-H and MSS tumor or normal samples in the pooled normal calling context. When using a clustered subset of sites, MSI-detection was comparable with the matched tumor\/normal context.<br \/>Conclusions: We developed a robust assay for MSI detection in multiple tumor types that encompasses library generation, data analysis, and diagnosis with 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We also demonstrate that accurate MSI-detection is possible in the absence of matched normal tissue, using a pooled normal reference and a curated target set.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ece34174-54d4-4447-9f59-30d68e99dd0a\/@z03B8ZSE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microsatellite instability,Mismatch repair,Sequencing,Lynch syndrome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18779"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jordan Aldersley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lixing Qi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ye Jiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akuah Kontor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yue Ke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaohui Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the role of cGAS has not been fully elucidated when cells are stimulated with DNA damage response such as ultraviolet (UV). In this study, we found that DNA damage by treatment of cisplatin or UVB induced cGAS protein levels. We further found that cisplatin and UVB increased not only endogenous cGAS protein levels, but also ectopic expressed cGAS protein levels. The cGAS protein increase was showed positive correlation with H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139 (&#947;H2AX). Moreover, although UVB stimulation suppressed cell proliferation in both stably expressing mock control (SK-MEL-2-mock) and cGAS in SK-MEL-2 (SK-MEL-2-cGAS) cells, suppression ratio in SK-MEL-2-cGAS cells was reduced compared to SK-MEL-2-mock cells. These results suggested that cGAS may have a potential to cell protection when the cells are stimulated with DNA damage. This hypothesis was supported by that cell proliferation of SK-MEL-2-cGAS cells were 2 folds faster than that of SK-MEL-2-mock cells after UVB stimulation. We further found that living cell population of SK-MEL-2-cGAS cells, which were 80% in no UVB stimulation, was reduced to 37% at 24 h and 34% at 48 h after 2 mJ\/cm2<\/sup> UVB stimulation, while SK-MEL-2-mock cells were reduced to 37% at 24 h and 20% at 48 h after 2 mJ\/cm2<\/sup> UVB stimulation. On the other hand, total cell death about 40% at 24 h and 65% at 48 h in SK-MEL-2-mock cells was reduced about 25% at 24 h and 36% at 48 h in SK-MEL-2-cGAS cells after 2 mJ\/cm2<\/sup> UVB stimulation. Taken together, we concluded that cGAS may play an important role to protect the cells from DNA damage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13d418a0-751d-4edf-950b-e42d135382f9\/@z03B8ZSE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Radiation-induced DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage,Cancer prevention,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Ultraviolet radiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18780"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Weidong Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun-Jung An<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ga-Eun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong-Yeon Cho<\/i><\/presenter>.

In particular, ECM stiffness has shown an important role in chemoresistance modulation. However, despite the central role of radiotherapy in cancer management, little is known about the effect of ECM stiffness on cancer cells radiation response. In this study, we used polyacrylamide collagen-coated hydrogel model to reproduce a soft (0.7 kPa) and a stiff (70 kPa) matrix. The model was validated by atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy and biological analyses through cellular morphology, proliferation and YAP\/TAZ mechanotransduction pathway that all confirmed the accuracy of our model. Then, lung cancer cells seeded on both soft and stiff hydrogels were irradiated, and the level of DNA damages were compared between the two conditions. First, alkaline comet assay revealed the total amount of DNA damages were higher in cells grown on a rigid ECM at 1 h post-irradiation than cells seeded on a soft matrix. Second, &#947;H2AX\/53BP1 foci assay showed that the number of DNA double strand breaks were also higher in cells grown on a rigid environment. However, the level of DNA damage was identical at 24 h post-irradiation for both stiffness, suggesting that a more efficient DNA damage repair response could take place for cells seeded in stiff matrix. In order to explain these observations, analyses on chromatin structure and nucleus shape were then performed. Data showed that cells cultured on stiff matrix displayed a larger nucleus, less condensed chromatin, and a decreased expression level of class I HDACs genes. Moreover, it was found that the level of total reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide ion was also higher in cells grown on a rigid environment 24 h post-irradiation. Altogether these data suggest that a high stiffness may increase early DNA damages after irradiation, partially by remodeling chromatin that could expose DNA to radiation-induced genotoxic agents such as ROS. Additional investigations are required to understand better the mechanisms that could explain such differences, but these preliminary data highlighted the potential role of mechanical stress in cellular radiation response and paved the way to new therapeutic target for radiotherapy management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e37eea5b-6393-499c-b82b-8b8bf4ebfec0\/@z03B8ZSE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Radiation-induced DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,Radiation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18781"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jerome Lacombe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melinda Muccio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederic Zenhausern<\/i><\/presenter>.

The FA repair pathway comprises at least 22 FANC proteins including BRCA1<i> <\/i>and BRCA2 and protects against carcinogenic endogenous and exogenous aldehydes. Individuals with FA are hundreds to thousands-fold more likely to develop head and neck (HNSCC), esophageal and anogenital squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) with a median onset age of 31 years. The aggressive nature of these tumors and poor patient tolerance of platinum and radiation-based therapy have been associated with short survival in FA. Molecular studies of SCCs from individuals with FA (FA SCCs) have been limited, and it is unclear how they relate to sporadic HNSCCs primarily driven by tobacco and alcohol exposure or human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Here, by sequencing FA SCCs, we demonstrate that the primary genomic signature of FA-deficiency is the presence of a high number of structural variants (SVs). SVs are enriched for small deletions, unbalanced translocations, and fold-back inversions that arise in the context of TP53 loss. The SV breakpoints preferentially localize to early replicating regions, common fragile sites, tandem repeats, and SINE elements. SVs are often connected forming complex rearrangements. Resultant genomic instability underlies elevated copy number alteration (CNA) rates of key HNSCC-associated genes, including <i>PIK3CA, MYC, CSMD1, PTPRD, YAP1, MXD4, <\/i>and<i> EGFR.<\/i> In contrast to sporadic HNSCC, we find no evidence of HPV infection in FA HNSCC, although positive cases were identified in gynecologic tumors.<i> <\/i>A murine allograft model of FA pathway-deficient SCC was enriched in SVs, exhibited dramatic tumor growth advantage, more rapid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and enhanced autonomous inflammatory signaling when compared to an FA pathway-proficient model. In light of the protective role of the FA pathway against SV formation uncovered here, and recent findings of FA pathway insufficiency in the setting of increased formaldehyde load resulting in hematopoietic stem cell failure and carcinogenesis, we propose that high copy-number instability in sporadic HNSCC may result from functional overload of the FA pathway by endogenous and exogenous DNA crosslinking agents. Our work lays the foundation for improved FA patient treatment and demonstrates that FA SCC is a powerful model to study tumorigenesis resulting from DNA crosslinking damage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/42945439-ab88-420b-8ea4-f1b9f5975faf\/@z03B8ZSE\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Mechanisms of genomic alterations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Hereditary cancer,Squamous cell carcinoma,DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19032"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Andrew L.

Compared to the rest of the genome, <i>promoter or promoter-proximal<\/i> (PPP) regions are more susceptible to mutagenesis and distinct mutational processes [e.g., transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs)]. We sought to investigate the nature of mutations in PPP regions across human cancer types and to define a novel TRC mutational signature.<br \/>Methods: Whole genome and RNA sequencing data for untreated primary cancers were downloaded from the International Cancer Genome Consortium repository. PPP regions were defined as 1kb upstream of transcription start sites. We quantified the number of mutations in 1) PPP regions, 2) PPP regions of highly transcribed genes (HTGs; &#8805;75th percentile), and 3) common fragile sites (CFS).<br \/>Results: A total of 835 patients across 12 tumor types were included in our analysis. Our data show significant variation in PPP mutations across cancer types with liver, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers demonstrating the highest burden of PPP mutations (Table 1). These same cancer types also possessed high numbers of PPP mutations specifically in HTGs. Since PPP mutations may be caused by TRCs, we proposed that liver, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers exhibited a strong TRC mutational signature. Therefore, we examined the correlation between the signature and CFS mutations&#8212;known to be caused by TRCs&#8212;to validate our results. The data show a positive correlation across tumor types; this correlation was strongest for cancer types where a TRC signature was more prevalent [correlation coefficient (R): liver: 0.985, pancreas: 0.991, ovary: 0.964].<br \/>Conclusions: Our analysis of PPP and CFS mutations suggests that transcription-dependent genome instability is more prevalent in liver, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. Further, PPP in HTGs may be a novel TRC mutational signature.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{D95A3038-6BF5-47C7-966E-CF1FDAFC1C0E}\"><caption>Medians and interquartile ranges of mutations by disease type.

Cancer cells are thus more dependent on the DNA damage repair pathway for their survival. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are amongst the most severe type of DNA damage and are predominantly repaired by homologous recombination (HR) in an error-free manner. RAD51 is a pivotal recombinase for DSB repair by the HR pathway. Binding of RAD51 with BRCA2 followed by its nuclear translocation, is one of the key repair mechanisms for RAD51 mediated DSB repair. We have identified novel and potent RAD51 inhibitors disrupting the RAD51:BRCA2 interaction, which can address BRCA2 WT patient population. Upon induction of exogenous DNA damage, our compounds inhibit nuclear RAD51 foci formation and demonstrate sustained &#947;H2AX accumulation in the nucleus, suggesting persistent DNA damage. Our orally bioavailable &#38; brain penetrant lead compound shows anti-proliferative activity in multiple BRCA2 WT cancer cell lines across various indications, and excellent synergy when combined with PARP1 inhibitors such as Olaparib. Further, in a wound healing assay, treatment with our lead compound inhibits cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. TNBC patients with extensive brain metastasis have limited treatment options. Thus, a brain penetrant RAD51 inhibitor could provide a novel treatment option in this setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a1032903-0241-4e11-bfbd-35450fb4abf0\/@A03B8ZSF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,DNA double-strand break repair genes,Synthetic Lethal,Homologous recombination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21476"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sanjita Sasmal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sukanya Patra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Venkatesham Boorgu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shankar Chithaluri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahesh Yanamadra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepika Hiremath<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hemashankar Pathange<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandeep M.

As HRD status becomes a critical indicator, many approaches have been proposed to measure the HRD status, among which estimating HRD status from cancer sequencing data is the popular strategy, where the representative methods include HRDetect, SigMA, FoundationFocusCDx, MyChoiceHRD, etc. Although sequencing data is the same input of these bioinformatics tools, algorithms prefer different aspects. Some methods focus on germline variants in BRCA1\/2 genes and somatic mutational signatures, while some others capture the genomic scars, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telomere allele imbalance (TAI) and large-scale state transition (LST). However, there are two major controversial points when applying these tools on clinical sequencing data. First, panel sequencing is the most popular sequencing plan in clinic, but gene panels usually carry only hundreds to a thousand genes. Thus, the panel sequencing can neither capture a large number of mutations to calculate mutational signatures, nor obtain large genomic scars, such as TAI and LST. Second, the associations between the mutations and HRD status is still unclear. Thus, scoring mutations and genomic scars is not reasonable. To solving these issues, we here proposed a machine learning-based method, called tmHRD, which estimates HRD status according to limited mutations and LOHs captured by clinical panel sequencing data. It consists of a semi-supervised learning (TRI) model and a multi-instance learning (MIL) model. The TRI model filters the false positives from mutation calls. Then, the filtered mutation calls from one patient is defined as a package, where each mutation call is an instance in the package. When training the MIL model, in each iteration, a package with known HRD status (label) is given to MIL model. MIL model calculates the correlations among instances and assigns an adjusted weight for each. Thus, the HRD status is only contributed by those mutations associated with. We tested tmHRD on several datasets obtained by the clinical trials we participated. Compared to the existing methods, tmHRD achieved better performance. The average recognition rate of tmHRD was approaching 90%, while the comparison methods show around 80%.
