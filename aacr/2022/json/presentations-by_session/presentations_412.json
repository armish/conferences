[{"Abstract":"Recurrently amplified oncogenes may represent melanoma vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapy. The genomic locus containing the Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase (PHGDH) gene at chromosome 1p12 is frequently amplified in melanoma. PHGDH is the rate limiting enzyme that converts the glycolytic intermediate 3-Phospho Glycerate (3-PG) to serine through the serine synthesis pathway (SSP). Serine is utilized to make glycine, glutathione, one carbon metabolites, proteins and lipids. PHGDH inhibition suppresses proliferation of 1p12 amplified melanoma cells. However, the role of PHGDH in chromosome 1p12 non-amplified melanoma is poorly understood. We observed that 1p12 non-amplified melanoma cell lines have enhanced expression of the SSP enzymes as compared to melanocytes cultured in tetradecanoyl-phorbol acetate (TPA, a growth factor that stimulates MAPK pathway). Moreover, TPA starvation in melanocytes increased PHGDH expression. This led us to hypothesize that activation of oncogenic MAPK signaling leads to high expression of PHGDH which can serve as therapeutic vulnerability in melanomagenesis. Acute expression of oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> in melanocytes resulted in upregulation of SSP enzymes, while treatment of melanoma cells with either BRAF or MEK inhibitor resulted in downregulation of SSP enzymes. We confirmed that PHGDH is regulated by BRAF-ERK-mTOR axis. Downregulation of PHGDH in 1p12 non-amplified melanoma cell lines decreased their cell proliferation and colony formation ability in vitro. We also observed that Phgdh knockdown in a Braf<sup>V600E\/WT <\/sup>and<sup> <\/sup>Pten<sup>-\/- <\/sup>(BPP)<sup> <\/sup>melanoma mouse model significantly increased survival. Furthermore, serine-glycine starvation (external source of Serine-glycine) in BPP chimeras did not affect the survival of these mice while on the other end, it suppressed the growth of the xenograft tumors injected in the NSG mice, which warrants further investigation. These results suggest the importance of PHGDH for melanoma cell proliferation and tumor growth irrespective of its amplification status. The exact mechanism of PHGDH regulation by BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> and the therapeutic effect of PHGDH inhibition in melanoma initiation and progression are the focus of our studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/53089258-24b1-4282-8074-dc50b86c3fe2\/@C03B8ZJb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Metabolism,Therapeutic target,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12448"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Neel N.

Loss of ER pathway activity is a hallmark of breast cancer progression, associated with accelerated tumor proliferation and resistance to endocrine therapy. How ER loss occurs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that serine starvation, a metabolic stress often found in solid tumors, downregulates estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) expression, represses transcriptional targets such as progesterone receptor (PR), and reduces sensitivity to antiestrogens, suggesting a transition of ER-positive (ER<sup>+<\/sup>) breast cancer cells to an ER\/PR-negative (ER<sup>-<\/sup>\/PR<sup>-<\/sup>) state. ER downregulation under serine starvation is accompanied by a global loss of histone acetylation. These chromatin changes are driven by metabolic reprogramming triggered by serine starvation, particularly lower glucose flux through glycolysis and the TCA cycle, leading to reduced acetyl-CoA levels and histone hypoacetylation. Supplementation with acetate or glycerol triacetate (GTA), precursors of acetyl-CoA, restores H3K27 acetylation and ER&#945; expression under serine starvation. Therefore, a major consequence of serine starvation in breast cancer could be global chromatin changes that influence lineage-specific gene expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f8b7e08-316e-4c1c-a0d1-f12a0aaa5f70\/@C03B8ZJb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor,Serine starvation,Epigenetics,Histone acetylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12449"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Albert M.

Recent evidence suggests ketogenic metabolic therapy as a complementary or alternative approach to breast cancer treatment. Under ketogenic conditions, as in starvation, the levels of glucose, insulin, and insulin-like growth factors in the blood decrease and stabilize, and the liver produces ketone bodies, acetone, acetoacetate (AcA) and &#946;-hydroxybutyrate (&#914;Hb) by beta-oxidation of fatty acids, as an alternative energy source. Due to the volatile nature of acetone and its instability in the blood, acetone has no effect on cancer cells under physiological conditions. AcA alone is unstable as well, and is used in research as a sodium or lithium salt. Despite the widely accepted use of lithium AcA as a ketone body source, we and others recently demonstrated that its cytotoxic effects result from the lithium and not from acetoacetate.In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effect of the third ketone body, &#914;Hb, on breast cancer cells in vitro. Using two cancer (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) and one non-cancer (HB2) breast cell lines, we evaluated the effect of &#946;-hydroxybutyrate treatment on cell growth parameters and assessed the effect of BHb on metabolism and the gene expression profile. We found that &#914;Hb increases viability and proliferation of MCF7, but has no affect MDA-MB-231 and non-cancer HB2 cell viability. We observed no changes in glucose intake or lactate output following BHb treatment, but an increase in ROS level was detected. Gene expression analysis revealed a differential effect of BHb treatment on changes in genes involved in lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, among the tested cell lines. While genes involved in lipid metabolism were downregulated in MCF7 cells, &#914;Hb mitochondrial monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4) expression was found to be significantly upregulated in both cancer cell lines with 10mM BHb but not affected in non-cancer breast cells. 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) and 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1), enzymes involved in BHb oxidation in the mitochondria, were significantly increased in MCF7 with a non-significant trend toward upregulation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment of MCF7 cells with 10mM of BHb also significantly downregulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and upregulated HDAC1, both known to be involved in BHb metabolism. Based on our results, we conclude that differential response of breast cell lines to BHb treatment, as alternative energy source or signal to altered lipid metabolism and oncogenicity, supports the need for a personalized approach to breast cancer patient treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/966c7002-fd50-4d94-9b32-971fa39fb8cd\/@C03B8ZJb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metabolism,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12476"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elimelech Nesher<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hadas Fulman-Levy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Koman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raichel Cohen-Harazi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Metastatic cancer is responsible for 90% of all cancer related deaths. Metastatic disease remains incurable as a population of cancer cells within a tumor are or become resistant to all known natural and synthetic therapies. Despite decades of research, the source of this therapeutic resistance still remains largely undefined. We have identified that the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) transition state is associated with therapeutic resistance. This state of cells are large in size, have high genomic content, and are the only cell remaining in tissue culture conditions after high dose chemotherapy. The PACC transition state has been documented in many different cancer types but their survival mechanisms have remained largely unexplored. We have discovered that the PACC transition state contains a higher number of lipid droplets (LDs) than the parental cells they are derived from. LDs are central anti-lipotoxic organelles that control fatty acid, diacylglycerol, cholesterol, and ceramide lipotoxicity by sequestering toxic lipids into inert triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and acylceramides. LDs are important in cancer as higher levels of LDs are associated with higher tumor aggressiveness and chemotherapy resistance. Utilizing TCGA data we discovered that PLIN1, an exclusive LD surface protein, is higher in prostate cancer patients with lower disease-free survival, higher Gleason score, and higher tumor stage. This indicates that more aggressive prostate cancer, which has been shown to have a higher number of PACCs in patient samples, is associated with higher levels of LDs. We hypothesize that the PACC state is surviving chemotherapeutic stress by sequestering toxic lipids into LDs to enhance cell survival. To determine when and how LDs form in the PACC transition state we used live cell imaging, western blotting, flow cytometry, and staining of key lipid droplet proteins. We utilized four different cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, LNCaP, MDA-MB-231) with three different classes of chemotherapies (cisplatin, docetaxel, etoposide). We established that LDs form in the PACC transition state as early as three hours post chemotherapy treatment. This suggests that the PACC state utilizes a key mechanism of sequestering toxic lipids into LDs as soon as therapy is applied to avoid lipotoxicity and cell death. We also discovered that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), an enzyme that mobilizes fats stored in LDs, was down in the PACC state compared to parental cells, indicating that these LDs are not readily being broken down after formation. Our future work will focus on inhibiting LD formation to increase cellular lipotoxicity in the PACC transition state leading to PACC death and an increase in overall cancer cells killed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0596058a-58db-47dc-ac59-15dae0218b23\/@C03B8ZJb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Lipids,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12477"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laurie Gayle Kostecka<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Amend<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Pienta<\/i><\/presenter>.

Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme in <i>de novo<\/i> fatty acid lipogenesis (DNL), is upregulated in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and its overexpression is related to carcinogenesis, growth, and metastasis. We previously demonstrated that FASN inhibitors show antitumor activity suppressing PCa cell proliferation and slowing tumor growth, both <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo, <\/i>via rewiring of lipid cancer metabolism and inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress.We observed that impairment of DNL increases polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) uptake as a compensatory mechanism of survival. Exogenously acquired PUFAs cause the remodeling of the prostate cancer cell lipidome, manifesting an enhanced acyl chain unsaturation across several lipid species. Lipid peroxidation and ROS accumulation are also observed, suggesting cell susceptible to oxidative damage following FASN blockade. Alterations in metabolic pathways cause a higher uptake of acetate and glutamine in PCa cells, as assessed by <sup>14<\/sup>C-nutrient incorporation following FASN inhibition. Mitochondrial dysfunction is induced by reduction in several respiratory parameters, including ATP production and basal respiration. This may be, at least in part, the result of a reduction in phosphatidylglycerol, a cardiolipin precursor, altering mitochondrial membrane composition. Supplementation with the PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increases phosphatidylcholine levels and total phospholipid acyl chain unsaturation, which can lead to membrane disorganization in prostate cancer cells. Superoxide anion production is enhanced by DHA treatment, as expected, and increased levels of glucose and palmitate oxidation by mitochondria are observed. Interestingly, AR and AR-V7 protein expression, as well as c-MYC and PSA, is reduced with DHA treatment. We then evaluated how <i>de novo <\/i>lipid synthesis inhibition combined with manipulation of the exogenous supply of fatty acids could impair tumor cell progression. Due to the obligate cell dependence on PUFA following DNL suppression, we combined FASN and Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitors with DHA supplementation and observed a significant cell growth inhibition in CRPC cell lines and prostate cancer organoids.Altogether, our results suggest a novel mechanism to inhibit the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer, combining lipogenesis inhibition with PUFA-enriched diet to overcome advanced disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8be675b1-8dee-429c-a356-f0a79955d579\/@C03B8ZJb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Lipid metabolism,Diet,Mitochondria,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12478"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Silvia D.

The concentration of metabolites can influence the activity of chromatin modifiers, which in turn can act as metabolic sensors that translate changes in cellular metabolism to transcriptional reprogramming. In the present study, we investigated the role of histone demethylase KDM2B in the metabolic reprogramming of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in which KDM2B is selectively expressed at high levels. Knockdown of KDM2B in TNBC cell lines reduced their proliferation rate and tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling demonstrated that the Serine-Glycine pathway and One Carbon metabolism (SGOC)<b> <\/b>and other amino acid biosynthetic and catabolic processes are downregulated by the knockdown of KDM2B. Additionally, we see reduction of metabolites produced via these pathways (purines, pyrimidines, formate, glutathione and NADPH). Importantly, the expression of the enzymes involved in the SGOC metabolic pathway (e.g. PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, SHMT2, MTHFD1L, MTHFD2 and DHFR) depends on c-MYC, NRF2, and ATF4 which our data show that they are under the positive regulatory control of KDM2B. The epistatic relationship between these factors, with the expression of the enzymes of the SGOC pathway and the effects of the KDM2B knockdown on chromatin occupancy and accessibility of the promoters of these factors is in progress and will be presented. Analysis of TCGA data showed positive and statistically significant correlations between KDM2B and the SGOC gene signature in TNBC patients. In addition, the metabolic pathway signature that distinguishes control and shKDM2B-transduced cells corresponds to the metabolic signature of a subset of TNBCs, which have been reported to carry poor prognosis. The present study highlights the role of the epigenetic factor KDM2B as an upstream regulator of the metabolic reprogramming of TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/246c6ecd-3d84-44a7-8d26-16274c2eef81\/@D03B8ZJc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Epigenetics,Breast cancer,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12480"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Evangelia Chavdoula<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vollter Anastas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro La Ferlita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julian Aldana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anuvrat Sircar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael A.

Identifying drugs that are approved for non-oncological conditions, but acquire antitumor properties through fasting could pinpoint new cancer cell liabilities and define new treatment options. By screening over 800 approved drugs in PK9 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, we identified several azoles (antifungal agents), including clotrimazole (CTZ), as agents whose cytotoxic activity against cancer cells is synergistically enhanced by starvation conditions. Since azoles inhibit 14alpha-demethylase, which is a key enzyme for cholesterol (CE) biosynthesis, we hypothesized that starvation and azoles would cooperate by blunting CE production in PDAC cells. Consistent with this notion, we found that simvastatin (an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) and terbinafine (TRB), which obstruct squalene epoxidase (SQLE), another key enzyme from the CE biosynthetic pathway, also had their antitumor effects strongly enhanced by starvation. Combined starvation and CTZ or starvation and TRB reduced intracellular CE in Capan-1 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, which depletes intracellular CE, and starvation also showed a synergistic interaction in Capan-1 and in MiaPaCa2 cells (another PDAC cell line). Finally, culture media supplementation with a water-soluble CE formulation prevented the synergistic interaction between starvation and CE biosynthesis inhibitors. TRB potentiation through starvation was countered through supplementation with insulin, IGF1 and leptin, which are downregulated during fasting. Consistent with CE being an essential constituent of membrane lipid rafts, that harbor the growth- and survival-promoting PI3K\/AKT signaling cascade, we found combined CTZ or TRB and starvation to markedly downregulate phosphorylated AKT in Capan-1 xenografts. Similar results were obtained in MiaPaCa2 cells. Capan-1 cell transduction with constitutively active, myristoylated AKT protected them from combined CTZ or TRB and starvation, indicating that AKT inhibition mediates the synergistic interaction between CE production inhibitors and fasting. Weekly 48h fasting enhanced CTZ and TRB antitumor effects in vivo in Capan-1 xenograft-bearing mice and, when combined with TRB, lowered circulating LDL (while increasing HDL) cholesterol as compared to TRB alone. Overall, these findings support the potential of fasting-based diets in combination with CE biosynthesis inhibitors against PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2799a2c7-ce0b-4ccc-9136-da4dae9f7265\/@D03B8ZJc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholesterol,Fasting,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Akt,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12481"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amr Khalifa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Guijarro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asmaa Namatalla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moustafa Ghanem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Lambertini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessio Nencioni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Caffa<\/i><\/presenter>.

With the most promising therapeutics, the overall survival after a stage IV PDAC diagnosis is only at 11.1 months. The marginal effects of current therapeutics emphasize the importance of developing new approaches to treat PDAC. In a wide range of cancer subtypes, a ketogenic diet has shown encouraging effects as combination therapy. However, the underlying anti-tumorigenic pathways involved in this diet alone are still not well understood. The ketogenic diet&#8217;s core elements and direct physiologic effects (ketone bodies, fatty acids, low glucose, low insulin levels) potentially alter PDAC biology that span from redox homeostasis to mitochondrial metabolism, and epigenetic modifications. We hypothesized that in carefully controlled in vitro and in vivo experiments, KD components delay growth of PDAC. Additionally, we hypothesize that understanding the underlying drivers of the anti-tumor effects of a ketogenic diet could be leveraged into the rational design of combination therapies that augment these anti-tumor effects. We show that in the subcutaneous mouse model of PDAC, tumor growth is markedly delayed under ketogenic diet restrictions Furthermore, in PDAC cell culture models, we observed anti-cancer effects when the ketogenic diet core elements are isolated. Specifically, fatty acids and ketone bodies inhibit PDAC cell growth, particularly under high glucose conditions. These effects are somewhat attenuated under low glucose, suggesting that these elements result in competing effects on PDAC cells (i.e., support some pro-survival pathways while inhibiting others). Future studies seek to better delineate the mechanistic impact of the principal ketogenic diet elements on metabolic pathways with a focus on mitochondrial metabolism, as well effects on epigenetic signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/84a1807b-790f-4572-89cf-b10371063446\/@D03B8ZJc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IDH1,Diet,Pancreatic cancer,Redox,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12482"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Omid Hajihassani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Vaziri-Gohar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mehrdad Zarei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Hue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helen Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anusha Mudigonda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erryk Katayama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hallie Graor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Winter<\/i><\/presenter>.

We previously showed that TNBC tissues display a distinct microbial signature. Obesity which contributes to chronic low-grade inflammation and gut microbial dysbiosis further exacerbates TNBC outcomes for NHB women. However, it is unclear the extent to which microbial differences in breast tumor tissues may be driven by alterations in microbial metabolites as a result of obesity status. Therefore, the aim of this global metabolomic profiling study was to investigate alterations in microbial metabolism pathways in breast tissues of NHB and NHW obese women (avg. BMI = 35.7) relative to non-obese women (avg. BMI = 23.4) with and without TNBC. In this study, we analyzed 984 metabolites derived from a total of 51 NHB and NHW women, including 15 patients with TNBC, 12 patients with less aggressive Luminal A-type breast cancer, and 24 healthy controls for comparison using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS\/MS) to identify microbial metabolites and metabolomic signatures that differ by breast tumor subtype and obesity status. We detected 501 significantly increased metabolites and 33 significantly decreased metabolites in TNBC patients compared to controls. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of the global metabolite profiling data revealed separation between the metabolic signatures of normal and breast tumor tissue. Random forest analysis revealed a unique biochemical signature associated with elevated L-Tryptophan (Trp) and Kynurenine (Kyn) metabolites and lower levels of microbial-derived metabolites critical for controlling inflammation and immune response in obese individuals and those with TNBC. TCGA analysis further revealed that expression of key Trp enzymes was significantly associated with worse survival outcomes in TNBC patients compared to other breast tumor subtypes. Our findings highlight a potential role for Trp metabolism through the Kyn pathway in obesity and TNBC risk. Further investigations into the Kyn metabolomic pathway may prove to be a novel therapeutic target for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7f12380-25ed-46f2-8083-6409299b5928\/@D03B8ZJc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Breast cancer,Obesity,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12483"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Alana Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingqing Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ernestine Kubi Amos-Abanyie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Tolley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beverly Lyn-Cook<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Athena Starlard-Davenport<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Here we demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines resistant to carfilzomib (CFZ), a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, have higher basal FASN expression and targeting FASN with small molecule inhibitors enhances the cytotoxic effect of CFZ in both AML and multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines.<br \/>Methods: In a proliferation assay, human AML and MM cell lines were treated with a single dose of CFZ for 7 days. Inhibition of proliferation was defined using an IC50 cutoff for CFZ of 10nM for AML and 5nM for MM as the threshold for sensitivity. Sensitive and resistant cell lines were subjected to apoptosis and cell cycle analyses by flow cytometry after being exposed to CFZ for 72 hours. Proteomic analysis was performed at baseline using reverse phase protein assay (RPPA). For CFZ and FASN inhibitor combination assays, AML and MM cell lines with varying sensitivities to CFZ were exposed to CFZ and FASN inhibitors, orlistat or TVB-3166, simultaneously, and the apoptosis rate were analyzed by flow cytometry. For western blots, selected AML and MM cell lines were incubated with compounds for 24 hours, and the lysates were probed for selected targets.<br \/>Results<i>:<\/i> Single-agent CFZ induced apoptosis in sensitive AML and MM cell lines, while apoptotic rates remained low in resistant cell lines. Cell cycle analysis showed increased sub-G1 population in sensitive cell lines compared to resistant cell lines. RPPA revealed that FASN, a key enzyme involved in lipogenesis, correlated with CFZ sensitivity, and CFZ resistant lines trended towards higher basal FASN levels. When CFZ was combined with FASN inhibitors, orlistat or TVB-3166, significant synergy was observed in the apoptosis assays in the AML and MM cell lines. Western blot analyses showed FASN inhibitors enhanced the anti-proliferation and pro-apoptotic effects of CFZ.<br \/>Conclusion: CFZ<b> <\/b>demonstrated single agent activity in nanomolar ranges in human AML and MM cell lines. When combined with agents targeting lipid-metabolism, CFZ showed synergistic effect in apoptosis, suggesting this combination could potentially be a new therapeutic strategy for AML and MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Multiple myeloma,Proteasome inhibitors,Fatty acid synthase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12484"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maoyu Peng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanaz Noelle Ghafouri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina SJ McDermott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis J.

Genes involved in lipid metabolism have been shown to be overexpressed in the contralateral unaffected breast of women with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer (BC) (PMID: 28263391). Exposure of non-transformed MCF10A breast epithelial cells to lipids results in altered chromatin structure, epigenomic reprogramming and changes in gene expression. Within the upregulated genes are numerous gene sets related to nervous system development, neurons and synapses. Neural genes are more highly expressed in Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) compared to non-TNBC, and several studies have shown a connection between neural stemness and tumorigenicity. We hypothesized that stem-like cells have a survival advantage when exposed to lipids and that lipid-induced molecular changes underlying malignant transformation are connected with a neural-like phenotype.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. To validate the association of lipids and neural genes, a second non-transformed, estrogen and progesterone receptor negative breast epithelial cell line, MCF12A, was exposed to vehicle or octanoic acid (OA) for 24 hours. Gene expression was assayed by RNA-seq and OA responsive genes were identified. Gene set enrichment analysis was utilized to identify gene sets affected by OA. The 954 neural genes identified to be upregulated in TNBC (PMID: 32080331) were compared to OA responsive genes in both cell lines. The Aldefluor assay was used to identify stem-like (ALDH+) cells in vehicle and OA treated MCF10A cells. To determine if lipid-exposed cells adopt a neural-like phenotype, MCF10A cells were grown on Poly-D-Lysine\/Laminin (PDL\/LM) coated plates.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. 5,684 and 5,305 genes were up- and down-regulated (FDR &#60; 0.01), respectively, in MCF12A OA treated cells. Numerous gene sets were significantly associated with OA exposure, including many neural-related pathways. More than 50% of the gene sets identified following OA-exposure were common to both cell lines. 418 and 303 neural genes upregulated in TNBC were significantly (FDR &#60; 0.01) upregulated after OA treatment in MCF10A and MCF12A, respectively. Cells growing on PDL\/LM plates assumed the normal MCF10A phenotype in presence of vehicle while OA-treated cells adopted a neuronal-like phenotype. Upon OA treatment the percentage of ALDH+ cells increased by a minimum of 10%.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. OA treatment was associated with the enrichment of ALDH+ cells, expression of neuronal-related genes and the development of neural-like phenotype. The upregulation neural genes upregulated in TNBC upon OA treatment may in part explain the association of lipid exposure and ER- BC. The upregulation of neural-related genes, and the development of neural-like phenotype suggests that lipid exposure results in cell state instability or plasticity, leading to reprogramming\/selecting cells with a multi-potential embryonic or stem-like state that has been associated with tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a9a6b36-75b2-4bf7-bc45-942d389e28ec\/@D03B8ZJc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast,Malignant progression,Lipid metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12485"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mariana Bustamante Eduardo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shivangi Yadav<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seema Khan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Clare<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, insufficient blocking of critical metabolic dependencies of cancer allows the development of metabolic bypasses, which significantly dampens therapeutic benefits of selective agents that target a single metabolic enzyme or pathway. We report here that head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells display strong addiction to glutamine. Devimistat, a novel lipoate analog, redirects cellular activity towards tumor-promoting glutaminolysis, leading to low anticancer efficacy in HNSCC cells. Mechanistically, devimistatinhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle by blocking the enzyme activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which upregulates GLS1 and eventually promotes the compensatory role of glutaminolysis in cancer cell survival. Most importantly, the addition of a GLS1 inhibitor CB-839 to devimistat treatment abrogates the metabolic dependency of HNSCC cells on glutamine, achieving a synergistic anticancer effect in glutamine-addicted HNSCC. These novel and significant findings could lay a scientific foundation for developing more effective treatments targeting the metabolic requirements of HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c64910e5-c8fd-43c0-8358-2a920cfeeb83\/@D03B8ZJc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glutathione S-transferases,Metabolism,Synergism,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12487"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Liwei Lang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chloe Shay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yonggang Ke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nabil Saba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yong Teng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

HNSCC is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, tobacco use, and abusive alcohol intake. Without truly effective targeted therapies, surgery and radiotherapy represent the primary treatment options for most patients. Unfortunately, these treatments are associated with significant morbidity and a reduction in quality of life. Immunotherapies have recently revolutionized HNSCC treatment, but &#60;20% of patients exhibit clinical responses, albeit often not durable (Saddawi-Konefka et al. Frontiers in Oncology 2021). This highlights the unmet need to identify novel therapeutic options and biomarkers predicting a more favorable response to maximize the efficacy of targeted cancer strategies for HNSCC treatment. Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid for rapidly proliferating cancer cells making glutamine pathway inhibition an attractive approach for anti-cancer therapy. We found that treatment with the broad glutamine antagonist sirpiglenastat (DRP-104), which irreversibly inhibits all known enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism, results in metabolically halted cell growth in a large panel (n=8) of HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC cell lines (IC50 of 0.2-25uM). Interestingly, HNSCC cells bearing genetic alterations in <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>PTEN<\/i> were significantly more sensitive to glutamine antagonism than unaltered HNSCC cells. The dependence of glutamine in HNSCC growth and the increased sensitivity of <i>PIK3CA<\/i>\/<i>PTEN<\/i> aberrant cells was also observed in orosphere assays and HNSCC tumor xenografts in mice <i>in vivo<\/i>. We next explored the mechanism of glutamine suppression in HNSCC by integrating the results from genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library screens and broad-spectrum metabolomics analysis. Both approaches converged on the identification of a dysregulated metabolic pathway that represents a synthetic lethal vulnerability that can be exploited via targeted therapies. Our data suggest that broad glutamine antagonism using sirpiglenastat (DRP-104) has therapeutic potential in HNSCC by dismantling cancer metabolism and sensitizing cells to additional perturbations leading to specific cell death. A clinical trial of sirpiglenastat (DRP-104) is currently ongoing (NCT04471415).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd0ab010-9de9-4132-9455-aef21319cc55\/@D03B8ZJc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glutamine metabolism,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Synthetic lethality,Metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12488"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Allevato<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yumi Yokoyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Wild<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>J.

Large-scale chromosomal alterations and mutations incurred by cancerous cells can predispose cancer cells to dysfunctional metabolic programming independent of microenvironmental pressure. Cancer cells are adaptable to this reprogramming and find alternative measures to sustain elevated metabolic demands. However, this process reduces the number of functional metabolic pathways. Dysregulated metabolic pathways within cancerous cells create an opportunity for therapeutic intervention by targeting genetic chokepoints within these pathways. We analyzed metabolic landscape of breast cancers by combining genomic and transcriptomic data from cancer patient datasets, to identify metabolic pathways prone to dysregulation due to genomic influence. Our platform identified disruption in the serine biosynthesis, which some cancerous cells rely upon to sustain elevated growth in a subset of breast carcinoma. We utilized gain- and loss-of-function techniques in multiple breast cancer cell lines to recapitulate metabolic disruption observed in tumors. These in vitro screens are complemented by metabolic flux analysis and stable-isotope tracer analysis that reveal the vulnerable metabolic pathways in breast cancers with dysregulated serine metabolism. Our data demonstrate that specific metabolic targets can be identified through this integrated screening and validated empirically to confirm their significance as avenues for potential therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4bc570ca-9f70-4b3a-82fa-d09d6fe025bb\/@D03B8ZJc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),MicroRNA,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12528"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mark Daniel Slayton<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhinav Achreja<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Heon Jeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liwei Bao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alisa Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mason Collard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepak Nagrath<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofia Merajver<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cysteine metabolism in particular is critical for supporting pancreatic cancer cell survival through its role in redox homeostasis. Targeting cysteine metabolism presents an underexplored opportunity for therapeutic exploitation, but much remains unknown about how cysteine metabolism is influenced by microenvironmental conditions and the overall metabolic state of the cell. One critical metabolic shift in pancreatic cancer cells occurs through altered isoform expression of the glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (PKM). Pancreatic cancer cells preferentially switch from the constitutively active M1 isoform to the allosterically regulated M2 isoform of PKM. Overexpression of PKM2 in pancreatic cancer cells produces a profound reprogramming of many metabolic pathways; however, the precise relationship between PKM isoform expression and cysteine metabolism is not well understood. We hypothesize that PKM isoform selection enables pancreatic cancer cell survival within a low cystine tumor microenvironment by reprogramming metabolic activity to increase cystine import and glutathione production and modulate glucose and glutamine metabolism to resist oxidative stress. We used lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 vectors to genetically modify two human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines, AsPC-1 and Panc-1, to exclusively express either PKM1 or PKM2. We evaluated the effects of PKM isoform selection on tolerance of low cystine environments by assessing viability under a range of cystine concentrations (0 &#8211; 50 &#956;M) reflective of physiologic and cystine starvation conditions. We observe altered viability and proliferation in PKM1 vs. PKM2 expressing cells under normoxic (21%) and hypoxic (1% O<sub>2<\/sub>) conditions. Targeted metabolomics using stable isotope labeling tracers further reveal impacts of PKM isoform expression in central carbon metabolism when cystine is limited. Additional experiments to elucidate the precise mechanism by which PKM isoform expression impacts pancreatic cancer cells are currently under investigation. This study provides valuable insight into the complexities of metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment and enhances our understanding of how cysteine metabolism could be targeted for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/faa358a3-3913-4e9e-9dbf-3c2dcb4ac4be\/@D03B8ZJc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Pancreatic cancer,Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12531"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elliot Ensink<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia Y.

Approximately 57,600 people were estimated to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the USA, and 47,050 were estimated to die of the disease in 2020 reported by The American Cancer Society. Novel effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Metabolic changes are typically associated with tumor development to support fast cell proliferation and malignant transition. Such metabolic deregulations differentiate tumor cells from normal cells and act as potential targets of anticancer therapies. Previous studies have shown cysteine dependence often presents in various cancers, since cysteine metabolism supplies glutathione - an important substrate for the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) cleanup cycle. Studies in breast and kidney cancers have shown that such cysteine-dependence is a prominent feature in the cancer subtypes with a mesenchymal cell phenotype, instead of in the epithelial subtype. We found that cysteine dependence exists in pancreatic cancer as well. Mesenchymal PaCa cells, in contrast to the epithelial tumor cells, appear to be more sensitive to cysteine depletion with extensive induction of ferroptosis, a programmed cell death pathway involving iron and lipid peroxidation. Gene expression analysis revealed the selenium transporter protein Sepp1 to be absent in the mesenchymal PaCa cells. Knockdown of Sepp1 expression in cysteine-independent cells renders cells dependent on cysteine. Selenium is a micronutrient required for the synthesis of selenoproteins including GPX4 and Sepp1. The addition of selenium alleviated cell reliance on cysteine and caused resistance to GPX4 inhibitor-induced ferroptosis. We observed that Sepp1 regulates the thioredoxin pathway to rescue the cells under the glutathione deficiency. Interestingly, the conditioned media assay also revealed that Sepp1 protects cells from ROS stress by a symbiotic mechanism. Our findings suggest that Sepp1 could serve as a biomarker of tumor cysteine-dependency and a potential molecular target for therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5e33c48-aabb-4e1f-bfa4-303672fdc087\/@E03B8ZJd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Selenium,Reactive oxygen species,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13945"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arslan Amer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tahiyat Alothaim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaohu Tang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite the recent success of immunotherapies, survival of lung cancer patients has not significantly improved in the last decades. New therapies are necessary. We have previously identified sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) as the major responsible for glucose uptake in LUAD, and we have showed that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors significantly delays LUAD development and prolongs survival in murine models. However, our data shows that SGLT2 inhibitors also induce de-differentiation of LUAD cells, leading to a more aggressive phenotype and increased resistance to cisplatin. Glucose deprivation causes reduced &#945;KG levels, leading to reduced activity of &#945;KG-dependent histone demethylases and consequent histone hypermethylation. Supplementation of &#945;KG or inhibition of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 reverse this phenotype, suggesting that this de-differentiated phenotype depends on insufficiency of &#945;KG-dependent histone demethylases and unbalanced EZH2 activity. Consistently, double treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor and an EZH2 inhibitor significantly reduces the tumor burden in a genetically engineered murine model of LUAD. We further characterized the effect of low glucose-induced tumor de-differentiation, identifying stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF1&#945;) as a major pathway responsible for the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype following glucose deprivation. Finally, we identified an HIF1&#945;-dependent transcriptional signature with prognostic significance in human LUAD. Our studies further our knowledge of the relationship between glucose metabolism and cell differentiation in cancer, characterizing the epigenetic adaptation of cancer cells to nutrient deprivation and identifying novel targets to prevent the development of resistance to metabolic therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae89ae8a-a1ad-4d77-a130-4f2b90be41c9\/@E03B8ZJd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Glucose metabolism,Epigenetics,Differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13956"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Pasquale Saggese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aparamita Pandey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eileen Fung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgio Giurato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Weisz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven M.

PNP inactivation has been paradoxically associated with both immunodeficiency and autoimmunity in humans but the genetic and molecular determinants of these divergent outcomes are poorly defined and whether they reflect cell type specific mechanisms is currently unknown. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of PNP inhibitors in a subset of patients with hematological malignancies are yet to be determined, thereby severely limiting the potential of this promising new class of metabolic targeted therapies. To address these gaps in knowledge we performed a systematic evaluation of the metabolic, immunological and cell-context phenotypic effects of targeting PNP using a clinical-stage inhibitor with picomolar affinity and excellent oral bioavailability. Here we show that across cancer types PNP inhibition is synthetically lethal with sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) deficiency by triggering massive dGTP pool expansion, and impairing DNA replication. These cytotoxic effects require the expression of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) which mediates the intracellular trapping of deoxyguanosine and expansion of dGTP pools, and are opposed by environmental deoxycytidine produced by bone marrow stromal cells in a SAMHD1 and nucleoside transporter dependent manner. This resistance mechanism to PNP inhibition can be counteracted by the deoxycytidine catabolizing enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA).<br \/>We further show that in addition to, and independent of its dCK and CDA-dependent cytotoxic effects in SAMHD1 deficient cells, PNP inhibition elevates serum inflammatory cytokines and cytokine transcript levels in secondary lymphoid organs. Using scRNAseq we identify CD19+ B-cells and CSF1R+ macrophages, which express the pattern recognition receptor TLR7, as the drivers of these alterations. TLR7 activation in these cell types is promoted by guanosine accumulation which functions as a ligand for TLR7 alongside uridine-containing ssRNA. Importantly, TLR7 stimulation achieved by PNP inhibition initiates transcriptional alterations that are quantitatively and qualitatively unique from synthetic TLR7 agonists, such as the production of type I interferons. We additionally demonstrate that PNP inactivation stimulates germinal center responses in secondary lymphoid organs via the expansion of activated B-cells and T follicular helper cells. In summary, we demonstrate that by modulating multiple metabolic and immune checkpoints in a multigenic, cell type and environment dependent manner, pharmacological PNP inhibition elicits specific outcomes which can be leveraged for the development of novel therapeutic applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a9966d4-949d-4984-af2e-c886ba219916\/@E03B8ZJd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TLR7,Metabolism,B cells,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13957"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Evan R.

Altered metabolism, like a shift to aerobic glycolysis, supports cancer cell growth and metastatic behavior. Similarly, immune signals from the tumor microenvironment can promote these same phenotypes and therefore, immune signals likely influence the metabolic state of cancer cells. More specifically, the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL4) promotes increased tumor cell survival, proliferation, and invasion upon stimulation of the type II IL4 receptor alpha (IL4R&#945;) which is aberrantly expressed on epithelial cancer cells. Previously, we have shown that metastatic mouse mammary cancer cells (4T1) rely on IL4 signaling for colonization of metastatic sites in the lung and liver. Additionally, these cells uptake more glucose when treated with IL4 <i>in vitro<\/i>. Here, we investigated the significance of glucose consumption on pro-tumorigenic phenotypes induced by IL4\/IL4R&#945;. In 4T1 cells, IL4\/IL4R&#945; signaling increased protein expression and global glycosylation of a primary glucose transporter, Glut1. In human metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), CRISPR-mediated knockout (KO) of Glut1 significantly reduced basal and IL4-induced glucose consumption when assayed by 2-NBDG uptake, a fluorescently labeled glucose analog. Glut1 KO reversed the proliferative effects of IL4\/IL4R&#945; activation on human cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Glut1 depletion attenuated tumor cell dependence on glucose consumption as shown by decreased expression of Hexokinase-2, a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. In addition, KO cells have elevated levels of the glutamine transporter, ASCT2, that are further enhanced by IL4 treatment which suggest a greater reliance on glutamine albeit, insufficient for cell expansion supported by IL4\/IL4R&#945; stimulation. Our data indicate that IL4-induced glucose consumption supports the increased metabolic activity necessary for cancer cell proliferation. Targeting the IL4\/IL4R&#945; signaling axis could be a therapeutic strategy to hinder tumor-associated metabolism and reduce tumor burden at primary and metastatic sites.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b3c021d5-6594-40c0-9d4f-2b3ead45db18\/@E03B8ZJd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glucose metabolism,Cytokines,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13958"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ebony Hargrove-Wiley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Valent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Demond Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wendy Bindeman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Fingleton<\/i><\/presenter>.

This suggests that treatment resistance is an ongoing challenge for a significant number of patients with melanoma, leaving an urgent need for improved therapeutic strategies. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that oxidative stress has an important role in drug resistance, and that wild type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is a major source of cytosolic NADPH that maintains redox homeostasis of cells under hypoxic and metabolic stress. This critical enzyme has not been thoroughly evaluated in melanoma. Herein, we explored the expression and function of IDH1 in human melanoma and the role of IDH1 in regulating melanoma metabolism.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We evaluated IDH1 expression in primary and metastatic melanoma using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We performed IDH1 knockdown by siRNA oligos, and evaluated cell viability by Trypan blue and PicoGreen assays under normal and nutrient-deprived conditions. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined by the DCFDA method. Metastatic activity of these cells was measured by transwell migration assays. In order to determine the impact of IDH1 in cellular metabolism, metabolomics profiling was performed by using LC-MS.<b><i> <\/i><\/b>These experiments were performed in A375 and SK-Mel 28 cell lines.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Analysis of TCGA data from melanoma samples showed IDH1 is highly overexpressed in primary and metastatic melanoma, and higher levels are associated with decreased progression-free survival in patients. Further, we validated that IDH1 is overexpressed in tumors by comparing normal skin tissue versus tumor samples by IHC and protein expression arrays. Silencing IDH1 impaired cell proliferation and migration (vs. control) in a nutrient-deprived microenvironment, but this effect was not seen in nutrient abundance. Metabolomics revealed that inhibiting IDH1 significantly decreased NADPH, &#945;-ketoglutarate (&#945;KG), and GSH levels with a corresponding increase in ROS levels and an impairment of mitochondrial function. In addition, silencing IDH1 sensitized melanoma cells to temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA-alkylating agent, as indicated by a decrease in relative cell survival compared with controls.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> IDH1 plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in melanoma.

Cell membrane potentials are very sensitive to K+ and may link to tumor acidosis when they become more positive than the equilibrium potential for H+ ions (Vaupel, P, et al., Cancer Res, 1989). Kir5.1(KCNJ16) heterodimerizes with Kir4.1(KCNJ10), a major glial potassium channel, to stop K+ conductance in acidosis. Trek1&#38;2(KCNK2&#38;10) are also pH sensitive K+ channels. Glioblastomas (more malignant and invasive) versus oligodendrogliomas showed decreased KCNJ16 in patients on anticonvulsants (Beckner, ME, Proc AACR, A2319, 2021). However, loss of genomic integrity in tumors and potential variation between assays prompted house keeping gene (HKG) normalization to lessen confounding factors. REMBRANDT (12\/31\/2020, Georgetown Database of Cancer) had 220 glioblastomas and 67 oligodendrogliomas with microarray gene expression via medians of each reporter (1-8 per gene) in Adobe Flash readouts (ended 1\/1\/21). A subgroup, 75 glioblastomas and 24 oligodendroglioma patients, took anticonvulsants. Comparison of genes of interest (GOI) initially had t tests between types of gliomas in the subgroup. Here, differences between glioma types for each GOI reporter were compared to differences for HKGs (PPIA, RPLP0, YWHAZ, and B2M). In gliomas with anticonvulsants, paired 2-tailed t tests for a null difference of median reporters between tumor types were less sensitive than new comparisons of oligodendroglioma minus glioblastoma (OMG) differences for GOIs versus OMG differences in HKGs. For KCNJ16, the t test, p = 0.015, for a decrease in glioblastomas (versus oligodendrogliomas) in initial studies improved to p &#8804; 0.0001 by using HKGs in comparisons. The KCNK2&#38;10 decrease in glioblastomas became significant, p = 0.047. Among other glycolytic and acidosis related genes, CA12, GLO1&#38;2, PFKFB1&#38;3, showed stronger trends, with p values from 0.08 to 0.13 (decreases and increase) in comparisons using HKGs. Conclusion: HKG normalization presumably corrects for loss of genomic integrity, assay variations, etc. in comparisons using microarrays of different tumors. The pH-sensitive K+ channel genes studied here were expressed less in glioblastomas. The resulting pH-insensitive K+ distributions in glioblastomas putatively shift their cell membrane potentials to less negative values which are sufficient to allow passive H+ efflux that causes extracellular acidosis with accompanying activation of invasion.

The ISR features a family of protein kinases that phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to distinct stresses. While phosphoryation of eIF2 reduces global protein synthesis, there is paradoxical induced translation of select stress adapative gene transcripts, including ATF4, which is central for ISR-directed gene transcription. Therefore, the ISR directs translational and transcriptional control that is critical for cancer adaptation to stress. Recently, eIF2 phosphorylation and ATF4 were suggested to play a role in prostate cancer (PCa) growth and survival; however, the specific function of ISR kinase(s), its mode of activation, and mechanisms by which the ISR facilitate PCa progression are not known.We discovered that the eIF2 kinase GCN2 (<i>EIF2AK4<\/i>) is activated in a range of PCa cell lines, contributing to enhanced eIF2 phosphorylation and ATF4 expression. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 reduced growth in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa cell lines in culture and cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft mouse models <i>in vivo<\/i>. Induction of GCN2 is accompanied by limitations of select amino acids and accumulation of cognate tRNAs that are reported to be activators of GCN2. A transcriptome analysis of PCa cells treated with a specific small molecular inhibitor of GCN2 indicates that this eIF2 kinase was critical for expression of multiple <i>SLC <\/i>genes, including amino acid transporters previously implicated in different cancers. We determined that GCN2 inhibition decreases intracellular amino acid levels, and reduced aminoacylation of select tRNAs, accounting for reduced growth in PCa cells. Using CRISPR-based phenotypic screens and genome-wide gene expression analyses of control and GCN2-depleted PCa cells, we confirmed the importance of the transporter genes in PCa fitness. One transporter, SLC3A2 (4F2), is a key <i>SLC<\/i> gene induced by GCN2 and is essential for PCa proliferation. SLC3A2 has been reported to associate with many SLC7 family transporters, allowing for the localization of these transporters to the plasma membrane for amino acid uptake. Of importance, expression of SLC3A2 partially restored amino acid levels and growth due to loss of GCN2. Our results indicate that select amino acid limitations activate GCN2 in PCa, resulting in the upregulation of key amino acid transporters, including SLC3A2, which provides for nutrient import to facilitate protein synthesis and metabolism required for PCa progression. We conclude that GCN2 and the ISR are promising new therapeutic targets for the treatment of PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/efc65113-3bea-4425-bbe2-82e664633aba\/@E03B8ZJd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Transporters,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13976"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ricardo Cordova<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jagannath Misra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nur P.
