[{"Abstract":"Over a thousand genome-scale loss-of-function screens have been performed, as part of efforts such as The Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap), to establish the landscape of genetic dependencies across a diverse set of cancer cell lines. A key challenge to using this resource for therapeutic target discovery is discerning common or tissue-related gene dependencies from those that represent true cancer-specific vulnerabilities. Although many successful cancer-specific targets have been identified by synthetic lethality with patient-prevalent driver mutations, the number of novel synthetic lethals identified as more cancer cell lines are screened has been limited compared to the total number of newly observed selective dependencies. Better understanding of how these selective dependencies are connected to molecular features of the sensitive cell lines could unlock a wealth of potential targets. As part of the DepMap project at the Broad Institute, we created a software pipeline and interactive web-tool for researchers to interrogate the compendium of CRISPR and RNAi screens and systematically rank potential targets by several key factors, most notably selectivity, disease indication, and predictability from multi-omics features (WES, RNAseq, methylation, proteomics). A strength of our framework is the ability to explore the relationships between a dependency and its top predictive features since this could provide insights into the mechanism underlying the cellular dependency and aid in generating therapeutic hypotheses. Additionally, users can perform disease-specific analyses and incorporate annotations for small molecule tractability or drug availability. We anticipate this tool will lower the barrier to systematic genome-wide target discovery using DepMap and provide insights into strategies and best practices for nominating promising targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bc8bd106-7f0a-4d22-a0a1-82e273879261\/@p03B8ZAc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Target discovery,CRISPR,Predictive biomarkers,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15902"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John M.

Neoantigens can be produced from a broad spectrum of genetic (SNV, fusion) and non-genetic (splicing, alternative promoter) sources. While alternative splicing is a broad source of neoantigens, concerns regarding their tumor specificity have hindered their evaluation as therapeutic targets relative to SNVs. To systematically define tumor-specific and likely immunogenic neoantigens, we developed SNAF (Splicing Neo Antigen Finder), an easy-to-use and open-source computational workflow. SNAF automates the prediction of high-confidence patient-specific and shared splicing derived neoantigens from RNA-Seq data. This workflow leveraged deep learning and hierarchical Bayesian models to prioritize potential splicing-neoantigen candidates by their tumor specificity (inferred off-target effects) and immunogenicity (T cell reactivity). SNAF is compatible with all major splicing identification algorithms and can be easily integrated into any existing splicing analysis workflows. SNAF predicted splicing neoantigens were validated with an improved accuracy over alternative approaches in ovarian cancer HLA targeted MS profiles. Applied to 825 breast cancer patients in TCGA, we find that splicing neoantigens are frequently shared among patients and overall burden is highly associated with overall survival and specific clinical subtypes. These data suggest alternative genomic monitoring of splice-derived neoantigen burden can be used to prioritize selection of patients for ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d8cf1dd-4ab6-4f8e-8f88-9168f8234040\/@p03B8ZAc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Splice variants,Bioinformatics,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15904"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guangyuan Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Salomonis<\/i><\/presenter>.

Access and ability to participate in clinical trials is a key element in providing therapeutic options for cancer patients.At the Avera Cancer Institute, options of biomarker-based clinical trials are routinely presented to the treating clinicians at the molecular tumor board (MTB). With everincreasing numbers of trials, a systematic method for keepingtrack of available trials andevaluating patients for trial options was needed. A search for solutions led to only one open-source tool, MatchMiner, but it did not meet our needs.<br \/><b>Methods and Results: <\/b>We developed an open-source web application, TrialMatch, that has the ability to (i) add trials through a semi-automated curation interface, (ii) browse and search trials, (iii) and match patients to biomarker-based trials.TrialMatch is an R Shiny application that uses a mongo database to store the trial data. Software installation and application instantiation is managed through Docker. <i>Curate <\/i>This section has fields for a user to enter trial name and a NCT ID from clinicaltrials.gov. It then queries the clinicaltrials.gov API and fetches data about the sponsor, treatment, etc.Although disease and biomarker data are available on clinicaltrials.gov, they are not stored as discrete fields that can be queried, and hence require manual input. The user provides disease type based on the OncoTree classification, as well as biomarker information for mutations, copy numbers, fusions, TMB, MSI status, PD-L1 status, RNA expression, and disease specific markers such as ER\/PR\/HER2 status.All information for a particular trial is entered in a mongo database collection, with each trial stored as a document. The ability to add and edit data fields can be restricted to specific users. <i>Browse <\/i>This section allows the user to browse through all trials with key information such as NCT ID, trial name, disease, and biomarkers. Each row represents one trial and can be expanded to show more detailed information.

Some examples are diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients, identifying syndromes in the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Units), insights into neuro-degenerative disease to name a few. NGS integrated with multi-omics data provides greater insight to underlying molecular mechanisms and helps to identify alterations specific to the disease condition. Accurate and robust detection of somatic and germline genomic alterations from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is complex where the datasets tend to be very large, and they require highly compute intensive operations that often take days to weeks to complete. By leveraging the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) accelerated framework, it is possible to analyze the WGS data and identify clinically actionable variants with fast turnaround times without compromising on the accuracy. In this study, we implemented a GPU accelerated framework for most used variant callers ie. Mutect2, MuSE, Somatic Sniper and LoFreq with significantly faster run times in comparison to their Central Processing Unit (CPU) counterpart. Methods Commonly used CPU based somatic variant calling algorithms Mutect2, MuSE, Somatic Sniper and LoFreq, were selected and subsequently accelerated to run on GPUs. The goal of this work is to generate results that are equivalent to the CPU version of these algorithms, but at much faster run times. As a control data set, we utilize the SEQC2 consortium WGS dataset consisting of ~50x tumor and normal samples to assess the performance of individual CPU variant callers to their GPU equivalents. Results The GPU accelerated framework overall provides 10-66x faster run times compared to their CPU-based counterparts. Individually, CPU vs GPU comparisons are, Mutect2 achieved a maximum acceleration of 66x, followed by MuSE, LoFreq both 11x and Somatic Sniper 10x acceleration respectively. The results from accelerated MuSE, LoFreq, Somatic sniper are identical in comparison to the CPU-based somatic variant callers, For Mutect2 we achieve 99.9% sensitivity and 99.85% precision. Discussion Recently, machine-learning based variant detection algorithms exhibited better performance compared to the statistics based heuristic approaches. Here, we have presented the results for an ensemble of four variant callers to be used as the starting point for an ongoing effort to develop a deep learning-based approach for somatic variant detection and smart filtering algorithms. The goal is to enable improved variant calling and provide a GPU computing framework for faster, better, and reproducible workflows to analyze large scale NGS datasets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7f9b4b2f-fa2b-4824-bed5-0cda3c60416f\/@q03B8ZAd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15906"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pankaj Vats<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ankit Sethia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mehrzad Samadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy T.

For example, mutation landscape maps integrate mutational and clinical data, revealing which somatic alterations are most closely associated with diagnoses, age, ethnicity, and outcome; t-SNE plots allow dissection of cancer subtypes based on gene expression or methylation profiling. These graphs are often created by researchers after extensive data curation and optimization of the layout using software tools designed for data visualization and are commonly presented as static figures in published literature. To permit seamless access to the genomic and epigenomic visualization tools created at St. Jude, we developed Visualization Community (https:\/\/viz.stjude.cloud\/, VisComm), which allows researchers to explore published graphs, develop custom visualization for their private data, and also serve as a public repository for completed graphs, as part of the St. Jude Cloud data sharing ecosystem. Sixty-five (65) interactive graphs from 31 publications in 231 pediatric subtypes are currently available, including t-SNE plots of RNA-seq and methylation data, mutation landscape maps, variant visualization on protein or genomic axes, epigenome states, and chromatin contact interactions. The graphs are searchable by cancer diagnosis, molecular profiling, research interest, publication, and research organization with features designed to enable user customization. To date, 5,014 users, 25 % of whom are recurrent, have accessed VisComm. On average, each public visualization has over 4,000 views while the most accessed graph has &#62;13,000 views. We have developed the ability to work in teams with in VisComm to empower collaborative development of new visualizations and controlled release by a research team. This feature enables the professional quality visualizations serve as resources for focused scientific communities such as the Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI) - Retina), a multi-institutional cross-disciplinary research team whose goal is restoring vision to patients by regenerating retinas. Videos and textual tutorials are being prepared using data generated from programs such as the Genome for Kids (G4K), a clinical genomic profiling program, that will help guide users to apply the underlying visualization software tools and to integrate public and private data of all types. VisComm is the first platform dedicated to enabling the development and sharing of interactive high-quality data-rich visualizations, which we expect will enhance data exploration and hypothesis generation for cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/888757f2-0d25-4078-951a-b6ecaab100ab\/@q03B8ZAd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Bioinformatics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15907"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David B.

Compilation of datasets generated from different research groups would allow for many additional or improved analyses, both due to increased computational power and accessibility. However, the process of accurately and effectively integrating datasets in an easily interpretable manner is challenging, and there is an unmet need for additional tools that incorporate multiple datasets in an effective and intuitive manner. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the third most common cause of cancer mortality, and there are several web portals, including cBioportal or TCGA, that integrate and analyze multi-omics data from multiple large-scale projects. However, these tools fail to integrate datasets generated by independent laboratories and thus leave a large portion of the available PDA data untapped. An tool that incorporates these data into a single easy-to-use source is not only useful but necessary to the PDA research community. Here we present PADCAS (PAncreatic Ductal Cancer AnalysiS), an intuitive tool that allows researchers and clinicians rapid access to multiple datasets related to PDA. Using a friendly visualization and easy-to-use exploratory panels, PADCAS allows the user to perform various statistical analyses investigating the expression of one or multiple genes of interest in normal tissue, primary tumor, or metastatic samples in both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. The tool integrates four public single-cell data sets where users can analyze gene(s) of interest in different context, such as across cell types (fibroblasts vs. macrophages vs. epithelial cells, for example) or tissue conditions. Additionally, regulatory network analyses have been performed and incorporated into the tool for a subset of the datasets, allowing users to investigate and visualize the activity of key proteins in both the ductal and stroma compartments. A complementary novel dataset generated from 23 PDA cell lines is also included with similar analysis options at the gene expression or protein activity level. PADCAS also incorporates bulk RNAseq data generated using laser capture microdissection (LCM-RNA-Seq) at Columbia University. LCM-RNA-Seq dataset includes human PDA, and low grade samples PanIN-1 and IPMN-adenomas), with cross-condition analyses performed at the gene expression level including survival analysis.

In fact, inter-patient tumor heterogeneity remains one of the major challenges in cancer therapy, making it difficult to optimize available treatments on an individual patient basis. Likewise, the systematic prediction of drug sensitivity <i>in vivo<\/i> is still a major challenge in translational research, where targeted therapeutics are currently selected based on the presence of either actionable oncogene dependencies or aberrant cellular mechanisms. A further challenge is the limited availability of models that faithfully recapitulate the biology, complexity, and heterogeneity of human tumors, including their interaction with a conserved microenvironment and a competent immune system.<br \/>To address these challenges, we introduce OncoLoop, a highly-generalizable, network-based precision medicine framework to triangulate between available mouse models, human tumors, and large-scale drug perturbational assays with <i>in vivo<\/i> validation to predict personalized treatment. OncoLoop requires only transcriptomic data (i.e., RNA-seq profiles) and leverages regulatory network analysis to (a) identify cognate models based on conservation of patient-specific Master Regulator (MR) proteins and (b) prioritize drugs based on their ability to invert the activity of MR proteins (MR-inverters), using drug perturbation profiles in cognate cell lines. As proof-of-concept, we applied OncoLoop to prostate cancer using a series of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that capture a broad range of phenotypes, including metastatic, castration-resistant and neuroendocrine disease. Indeed, &#62;70% of patients in published cohorts had at least one high-fidelity matched GEMM. Drugs targeting shared Master Regulator dependencies of a patient and its cognate GEMM(s) were predicted using perturbational profiles of &#62;300 drugs in MR-matched cell lines, resulting in an 80% validation rate in GEMM allografts and human xenografts. This network-based approach is highly generalized and can be applied to both cancer and non-cancer-related contexts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b1382be8-d5ca-44d9-bbc9-455d3c7be7a8\/@q03B8ZAd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Drug discovery,Animal models,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15911"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alessandro Vasciaveo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Zou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan M.

We next predict response to monotherapy and combination treatment in three independent screens performed across cancer cell lines and patient-tumor-derived cell lines using their sc-expression profiles. Translating to the clinical context, we successfully stratify responders of combination therapy in a multiple myeloma clinical trial using the tumor&#8217;s sc-expression profile. For individuals in this trial, we next find the optimal combination treatments (pairs and triplets) from the existing FDA-approved drugs set, where the pair of gefitinib and niraparib, an EGFR and a PARP inhibitor, is one of the top candidates.<br \/>In sum, we provide a first-of-its-kind framework to utilize the tumor&#8217;s sc-expression to identify responders to combination therapy or to design an optimal combination for an individual patient.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Precision medicine,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15912"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanju Sinha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahulsimham Vegesna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandro Schaffer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eytan Ruppin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Decades ago, the limited number of drugs represented a tractable candidate list from which to design combination experiments. However, the current pool of single-agent drugs to potentially combine is far too large to brute-force screen, and purely computational predictions have performed poorly. Suitable screening methods are needed, but the design of experimental approaches has proven to be highly complex; researchers need to carefully balance many variables such as appropriate drug concentration ranges, number of doses, inclusion of replicates, and throughput. Perhaps the most significant obstacle facing these studies is the approach to data analysis, where conflicting definitions of synergy and unintuitive metrics serve to confuse researchers and render largely uninterpretable results. Collectively, these challenges hamper the progress of drug combination research and ultimately translational impact. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a fully self-contained framework to handle both the experimental design and analysis of drug combination experiments. Our method, called Combocat, provides a straightforward way to test and analyze any number of drug combinations and samples, and is suitable for high-throughput. Combocat provides a high-resolution of concentration combinations compared to most current approaches. This is automated by common instruments and uses scripts included within our protocol. Through careful template design, we were able to include 3 replicates of each 10x10 matrix, single-agent drugs, and controls - all within a single 384-well plate. We found our method to work robustly with varying sample types (Human cancer, bacteria, fungi), and readouts. After data generation, files can simply be dragged into our Combocat analysis tool directly. We provide a free, web-based software suite to fully automate the analysis after data collection. The Combocat web tool is intuitive and facilitates interactive exploration of synergy. It also provides a rich array of information such as dose-response curves, IC50 values, synergy matrices, ranked hit plots, and more. Data normalization, synergy algorithms, scoring functions, and other complex calculations are run swiftly and automatically in the background with no need for user input. Notably, we employ statistical testing by taking advantage of experimental replicates, which is a feature we found lacking in most methods. We use a well-documented synergy metric but also decided to formulate our own Combocat score which considers statistical measurements and assay quality. The Combocat score provides an easy interpretation of results and facilitates quick identification of top hits. Collectively, our platform will be used to enhance and expedite the selection of effective drug combinations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cf8008ea-7546-45e2-9c22-1fd0443be156\/@q03B8ZAd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synergism,Combination therapy,Drug synergy,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15914"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William C.

Chronic long-term ultraviolet (UV) exposure drives cSCC development. Early clonal mutation (CM) accumulation is the first step in photocarcinogenesis and is the first known manifestation of field cancerization. Understanding CM accumulation and development is expected to improve the prevention of field cancerization and cSCC. Nevertheless, CMs are poorly understood, and mutations in cSCC have yet to be systematically compared to CM in sun-exposed skin. Key steps for studies to detect and compare CMs are to design optimal targeted sequencing panels and compare mutational hotspot areas. The ideal panel should cover genomic regions containing maximum numbers of mutations within a given number of amplicons. Currently there is no computational tool to help optimize target area selection. Therefore, we aimed to create an algorithm to optimize sequencing target area design for capturing high mutation frequency hotspot areas. An R Shiny web application was created to identify an optimal sequencing target panel from an input mutation dataset and compare the distribution of mutational hotspots. The tool optimizes sequencing target areas based on preset amplicon length by identifying the best fitting panel of amplicons to capture mutations efficiently. Besides identifying optimal sequencing target areas, the developed software also efficiently identifies the most highly mutated genomic areas and compares target area overlaps. The developed algorithm was used to compare the mutational hotspots of cSCC and CM in clinically normal-appearing skin or cSCC from previous publications (cBioPortal, Martincorena et al, Hernando et al, Wei et al, Fowler et al). The current method was more efficient than tested previously available alternative methods by increasing target areas capture efficacy by 1.05 - 8.1-fold. Using the developed tool, we found that frequently mutated areas of CMs in normal skin significantly overlap (p &#60; 0.005) with those of cSCC. Mutational hotspots of normal skin with a history of frequent UV exposure had 1.2-fold greater overlap with cSCC than skin with minimal UV exposure, suggesting the frequently UV-exposed skin carries a greater number of cSCC-related mutations. Although we found that normal skin CM hotspots better predict capture efficiency in sun-exposed normal skin than cSCC mutation hotspots, cSCC mutation hotspots can still design efficient sequencing targets in genomic areas where we do not have deep sequencing data on CM in normal skin. Our work provides a framework for helping design efficient, customized sequencing panels covering the genomic regions with the highest number of mutations. We expect the current algorithm to be a valuable tool for similar studies of other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/177a588b-c5f9-4651-95dd-541ad42f23b6\/@q03B8ZAd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skin carcinogenesis,Somatic mutations,Ultraviolet radiation,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15916"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sydney R.

Visible light scatter and one or more fluorescence characteristics are assessed for each particle. The most common use of flow cytometry is immunophenotyping. In traditional flow cytometry analysis, a region around a population of cells is manually drawn (gating) in two-dimensional scatter plots. This enables the measuring of specific groups of cells. However, manual gating could increase the overall error rate of the study and makes the analysis hardly reproducible since it is done in less controlled settings. Furthermore, it represents a bottleneck in the analysis of large amounts of data. Some processes, such as gating, have recently been automated using R packages. In addition, dimensionality reduction approaches have been developed in the flow cytometry environment to take advantage of information from several markers at once. Despite this, none of them are integrated in a harmonized way, and none of them allow back-gating to emphasize the study population and eliminate false positives. To tackle this problem, our team has developed flowTOTAL (github.com\/ImmunoOncology\/flowTOTAL), a user-friendly command line workflow to analyze flow cytometry data. The major attractive feature is the facility to perform with one command not only a traditional analysis, but also an unsupervised analysis. As input, the user has to indicate the folder with the .FCS files, the metadata associated with each file, and the marker to be used during back-gating. The pipeline is divided into three main sections: preprocessing, traditional analysis, and unsupervised analysis. During preprocessing each. FCS will be subjected to correcting for fluorescence spillover (compensation), detection of anomalies by checking flow rate and signal acquisition as well as removing doublets based on forward scatter (QC). For the traditional analysis, auto-gating will be performed for the identification of the target population using back-gating. For each set of given markers, the number of events obtained and the scatter plot will be generated. Finally, in the unsupervised analysis, the population of interest will be specified and the pipeline will proceed with normalization, dimensionality reduction using PCA or UMAP and finally a clustering approach for subpopulation identification. In addition, differential abundance analysis can be performed with metadata information. flowTOTAL is presented as a standardization for the analysis of flow cytometry data, comprising all the necessary steps for comprehensive analysis and allowing mass analysis. Furthermore, it goes beyond the simple quantification of particles, since the implementation of more complex methodologies allows for the discovery of subpopulations that are not present in the traditional analysis but have a significant biological role.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9586e0c1-a7ad-4ac8-b08c-e0392e8772fd\/@q03B8ZAd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-01 Analytic pipeline optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Flow cytometry,Bioinformatics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15918"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juan Luis Onieva<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Cháves<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javier Oliver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>María Garrido-Barros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Zafra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Belén Sojo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alfonso Sánchez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Álvarez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pedro Jiménez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilio Alba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miguel Berciano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonio Rueda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuel Cobo-Dols<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabeth Pérez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabel Barragán<\/i><\/presenter>.

Complementing mutation-based assays, cfDNA carries information about epigenetic modifications from decaying cells. This information is encoded in the shape of the cfDNA fragments. Specifically, fragments from cancer tend to be shorter than those originating from other adult cells, enabling a distinction between cancer patients and healthy individuals. Additional cfDNA features such as fragment end motifs and information on nucleosome positioning provide further insight into cancer biology. These cfDNA measures are typically inferred from low-pass whole genome sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics processing. A key bioinformatics step is the alignment of DNA sequencing reads to the reference genome, which critically depends on preprocessing steps such as read trimming and alignment filters. A good understanding of preprocessing settings is thus crucial to derive accurate information from cfDNA. We therefore investigated to what extent preprocessing choices affect cfDNA analysis. To this end, we have built a robust bioinformatics pipeline that evaluates a range of possible preprocessing settings. The pipeline is implemented in a bioinformatics workflow engine, enabling a scalable and reproducible workflow. We are currently evaluating the effect of preprocessing on global and regional fragmentation patterns, detection of nucleosome positioning and identification of fragment end motifs. The different preprocessing settings are also evaluated for their ability to distinguish cancer from control samples using cfDNA fragmentation information. We are benchmarking the pipeline using cfDNA datasets from multiple centres to ensure our findings are generalizable over different platforms and experimental procedures. Our investigations will allow us to build a versatile bioinformatics preprocessing pipeline for the analysis of cell-free DNA fragmentation data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cf415770-847d-44be-8df8-64d0e58ddc8e\/@q03B8ZAd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-01 Analytic pipeline optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Liquid biopsies,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15920"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ivna Ivankovic<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zsolt Balázs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todor Gitchev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Trejo Banos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norbert Moldovan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Panagiotis Balermpas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Willmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolaus Andratschke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florent Moulière<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Krauthammer<\/i><\/presenter>.

All NCI PDMR models undergo quality control (QC) processes. Two unique QC challenges are: a) to assess genomic stability across PDX model passages; and b) to confirm the suitability of PDX-derived cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as germline surrogates when blood is not available. Multiple bioinformatics QC assessments have been developed to measure the genomic fidelity in these PDX models using low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) and in CAFs using whole exome sequencing (WES).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> LP-WGS was performed on 502 PDX samples from 38 models of rare cancer across passages 2 through 9 and WES was performed on 92 CAFs from 32 different histologies. In the QC workflow for estimating the genomic stability of passages within models, BBSplit was used for the assessment of human\/mouse DNA content. CNVkit was utilized for copy number (CN) detection. The fraction of genome changed was calculated by comparing the copy numbers of each passage sample to the original patient sample. To evaluate purity of CAFs, three QC steps were constructed: a) plot of SNP variant allele frequency (ideogram); b) variant annotation using OncoKB (www.oncokb.org); c) percentage of genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH), based on a set of ~800,000 heterozygous SNPs from a population-level genomic database (gnomAD) based on WES data.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: PDX models showed genomic stability in CN profile when measured by LP-WGS. Human tumor DNA content remains stable ranging from 75-85% across different tiers of PDX passages from Donor +1 to Donor +6 and more. No models showed statistically significant evolution in CN profile, given the average 5 samples per model in each tier of passages. The QC workflow for CAFs generated five categories based on SNP ideograms, the presence\/absence of oncogenic variants and LOH. Following observations were made: a) 72.5% CAFs were confirmed as matched diploid CAFs (category 1); b) 6.6% of CAFs were diploid and had &#62;= 1 germline oncogenic variant - classified as category 2. CAFs in category 1&#38;2 were suitable as germline surrogates; c) 12% of CAFs (category 3) showed putative polyploidy on SNP ideograms with no oncogenic variants and suitable for somatic variant calling; d) 8.8% of CAFs (category 4) had polyploidy and oncogenic variants present; e) LOH high CAF (category 5) - we identified a CAF with 42% LOH, later confirmed to be a tumor cell line by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Other CAFs (n=91) showed little variance, ranging from 0.6%-1.7% LOH.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We developed standard QC workflows to evaluate genomic stability of PDX models during passaging and qualify CAFs as germline surrogates for pre-clinical study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/541b1611-b56b-4be9-a107-4fd2c7101ab2\/@q03B8ZAd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) ,Quality control,Bioinformatics pipeline,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15922"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ting-Chia Chang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Biswajit Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yvonne A.

These cancer health disparities are the result of complex interactions between social determinants of health, population-specific cultural behaviors and lifestyles, and unique biological differences that associate with ancestry. Two major limitations to the advancement of precision medicine in minority groups include the lack of: i) race\/ethnic appropriate genomic data, which will facilitate identifying priority targets for therapeutic development, and ii) patient-derived models, such as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that recapitulate the unique interactions of germline and somatic genetics that exist in minority patients. In this presentation we describe the development of an analytical pipeline to quantify continental genetic ancestry that we have developed for the Cancer Genomics Cloud as part of the PDX Development and Trials Center Research Network (PDXnet). This pipeline leverages a novel reference panel for the program SNPweights, which includes a greater representation of genomic data from Native and Latin American populations than previously published reference panels, and thus provides improved assignment of American continental ancestry. We use this pipeline to characterize the diversity of the PDX models in PDXnet, which represent a manifold increase in models with African and American continental genetic ancestry compared with those available in other public resources. Finally, we present power analyses to demonstrate that additional PDX models derived from patients from minority populations are critically needed to effectively address health equity goals in the US.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ca1f77c8-5283-4826-b2fb-07d5cd1b0ce2\/@r03B8ZAe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Precision medicine,Race,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15924"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian J.

Despite this, there has previously been no systematic way to identify metabolism-based targets for therapeutic intervention. This is especially concerning when considering that targeting tumor metabolism has been shown to increase the efficacy of standard chemotherapy in pre-clinical studies. We therefore developed a systems medicine approach to interrogate tumor metabolism systematically, identify the effects of metabolic heterogeneity on overall survival prognosis, and gain insights into new metabolism-associated targets or therapies to complement standard of care for cancer patients. <b>Method:<\/b> Our systems medicine framework statistically integrates metabolic network modeling with RNA-sequencing data (RNA-seq). This allows us to integrate molecular data about individual tumors (from RNA-seq) with a curated knowledge base of how these molecules interact within a patient&#8217;s tumor (using metabolic network models). This results in a mathematical description, or model, of a specific tumor&#8217;s metabolism that is able to be interrogated (i.e., it is high-dimensional like RNA-seq data) and able to be simulated (i.e., we can &#8220;drug&#8221; the model and investigate downstream effects). <b>Results:<\/b> We applied this systems medicine approach across a range of tumor types, including lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic melanoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and salivary cystic adenoid carcinoma. Within each cancer type, we found significant patient-to-patient metabolic heterogeneity. Across cancer types, a consistent pattern that emerged was that the metabolic systems with the most patient-to-patient heterogeneity were also the systems most associated with patient overall survival. This result suggests that metabolic variability is a key driver of tumor response to therapy and overall patient survival. Furthermore, targeting metabolic pathways in a patient-specific manner could enhance chemotherapy in tumors with metabolic profiles associated with poor prognosis. <b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study shows that the specific metabolic profiles of tumors are key drivers of overall survival. We therefore believe that metabolic tumor characterization and intervention could be a useful strategy to enhance chemotherapy efficacy and overall survival in patients across tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40ad4302-e1f1-42f2-bed6-38e7d9360b56\/@r03B8ZAe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Renal cell carcinoma,Systems biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15925"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Cook<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John A.

These can occur in the context of clinical trials and therapy de-escalation, where the focus is on delivering effective NAT to patients while reducing drug toxicity. The risks added by disease progression underscore the need for early identification of NAT progressors. To this end, we replicated the NeoSphere study in silico using TumorScope (TS), a biophysical modeling software, focusing on predicting disease progression during NAT. The NeoSphere trial studied the efficacy of docetaxel (T), pertuzumab (P), and trastuzumab (H) in combination with one another over 254 operable BC patients distributed across four study arms. We selected past BC patients with accompanying standard of care clinical data that matched NeoSphere sample composition based on patient and tumor characteristics. A total, 144 patients were included across four study arms (TH, THP, HP, and TP). Parameters from the NeoSphere study were mirrored where possible. Simulation generated volume trajectories of individual tumor&#8217;s response to therapy. Disease progressors were identified based on tumor volume at the final simulation timepoint compared to the first simulation timepoint. We then compared group means and proportions between progressors and responders using Welch&#8217;s two-sample t-test, and Fisher&#8217;s exact test, respectively. We replicated the NeoSphere trial using TS. pCR rates across study arms closely mirrored those of the actual trial. In the HP arm of our trial, we identified 12 (12\/144) progressors. No difference was found when comparing it to that observed in the NeoSphere trial (p=1.00, OR=1.12). As expected, percent change in tumor volume from initial to final timepoints for the progressor group was significantly higher than the responder group (n=121, t=19.2, p=1.5x10<sup>-10<\/sup>, mean progressor=38.7, mean responder=-75.9). The progressor group was enriched with higher grade tumors (t=2.85, p=0.01), as well as HR-negative tumors (p=0.002, OR=7.54) compared to the responder group, and had lower HER2 receptor FISH ratios (t=-3.4, p=0.002). There were no differences observed between groups age, cancer subtype, or AJCC tumor stage (p&#62;0.05). After trial replication, we identified clinical features that separated progressors from responders, which are being assessed for development of individualized predictive biomarkers of disease progression. While work is ongoing in the field to identify biomarkers of BC progression, it is evident that single markers are not sufficient. Comprehensive, multi-modal biomarkers of disease progression must be developed and applied to patient sub-populations to garner effective predictions. Using biophysical simulations, we are able to investigate the impact of drug delivery\/sensitivity, metabolism, and spatial heterogeneity on BC progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7efc9e0-2c19-44e6-843a-cc9ba7d6283d\/@r03B8ZAe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,HER2,Chemotherapy response,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15926"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>John Pfeiffer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Foley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eduardo Braun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anu Antony<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lance Munn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph R.

Typically, SL is described as the interaction of two genes, whereby simultaneous inactivation of both genes results in cell death whereas loss of one gene can be tolerated. Given the importance of SL to develop highly selective anti-cancer therapeutics, large efforts have been undertaken to identify these interactions, both experimentally and computationally.<br \/>Here, we present a novel computational framework harnessing large-scale cell line gene inactivation screens (DepMap, Project Score), as well as patient data (TCGA), to discover known and novel SL gene pairs. Overall, we implemented six statistical tests considering gene dependency scores, genomic profiles, gene expression and patient survival as parameters. We further utilized data from public drug screening consortia to validate our top-ranking pairs.<br \/>We applied our framework to a defined target space covering genes relating to DDR, chromatin binding, cell cycle and druggable genes (overall &#62; 2.5 M. pairs were tested). When focusing on SL partners for three DDR genes with promising inhibitors in early clinical development: ATM, ATR and DNA-PK; we noticed that chromatin modifiers were enriched in the top ranking pairs. In particular, SL interactions were predicted with histone (de)methylases, histone (de)acetyltransferases and members of SWI\/SNF family.<br \/>For instance, we observed that loss of function mutations in several members of the KMT2 family, also known as MLL family, would render cancers cells more dependent on ATR or ATM. Similarly, drug sensitivity was increased for selected DDR inhibitors in cell lines with KMT2 mutations. Members of the KMT2 family play essential roles in transcription, but have recently also been shown to be recruited to DNA damage sites and may be mediators for PARP inhibitor sensitivity. The KMT2 family is frequently mutated in several cancers types such as endometrial and bladder, thus underpinning their suitability as potential selection biomarkers as well as relevance to cancer.<br \/>Furthermore, we observed that patients with mutations in EP300, a histone lysine acetyl transferase, exhibited an increase in ATR expression which may comprise a compensatory mechanism. In addition, patients with ATR and EP300 double mutation tend to have a better probability of survival, suggesting decreased tumor fitness.<br \/>In summary, we present a modular framework to predict SL gene pairs to a defined target space. Here, we focused on discovering novel SL relationships for the key DDR regulators ATM, ATR and DNA-PK. Our results provide not only new biomarker hypotheses for further validation, but also suggest that cancers with a high mutation rate in chromatin modifying genes may be efficiently targeted by DDRi.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7fc7259-616a-4267-aea1-134492ce2f5b\/@r03B8ZAe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,DNA damage response,Chromatin remodeling,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15927"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna M.
