[{"Abstract":"<i>Introduction:<\/i> Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that remains incurable, with patients enduring multiple relapses and development of drug resistance. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are critical anti-MM agents. IMiDs act by inducing CRBN-dependent proteasomal degradation of the transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3, which leads to IRF4 and MYC downregulation (collectively termed the &#8220;Ikaros axis&#8221;). Although CRBN aberrations occur, whether they are a functional mechanism of resistance in patients remains unclear. Based on the importance of CRBN in IMiD response, we hypothesized that IMiD treatment fails to downregulate the Ikaros axis in IMiD-resistant MM cells.<i> <\/i><br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> To measure IMiD-induced Ikaros axis downregulation, we designed an intracellular flow cytometry assay that measured relative IKZF1, IKZF3, IRF4 and MYC protein levels in MM cells following ex vivo pomalidomide (Pom) treatment. We established this assay using IMiD-sensitive parental and dose-escalated Pom resistant MM1S and H929 cell lines before utilizing it in patient samples (isolated mononuclear cells). To assess the Ikaros axis in the context of MM intratumoral heterogeneity, we used mass cytometry to simultaneously characterize MM subpopulations in patient samples. Lastly, we determined ex vivo drug sensitivity in patient samples via flow cytometry.<i> <\/i><br \/><i>Results:<\/i> Our hypothesis was supported in MM cell lines, as sensitive parental lines showed a significant decrease in all Ikaros axis protein levels following Pom treatment, while resistant lines showed no IMiD-induced decrease in any Ikaros axis protein. However, when assessed in CD38+CD138+ cells from patient samples, Pom treatment caused a significant decrease in IKZF1, IKZF3 and IRF4 regardless of IMiD sensitivity. Mass cytometry in patient samples revealed that individual Ikaros axis proteins were differentially expressed between subpopulations. When correlating this with ex vivo Pom sensitivity of MM subpopulations, we observed that low IKZF1 and IKZF3 corresponded to Pom resistance. Interestingly, most of these resistant populations still expressed MYC. We therefore assessed whether IMiD resistant MM was MYC dependent by treating Pom resistant MM cells with MYCi975. In 88% (7\/8) of patient samples tested, IMiD resistant MM cells were sensitive to MYC inhibition.<i> <\/i><br \/><i>Conclusions:<\/i> Our findings did not support our initial hypothesis, as IMiD-induced IKZF1 and IKZF3 degradation remains intact in IMiD resistant MM cells from patient samples. However, our data support a mechanism where the Ikaros axis no longer drives MYC expression in IMiD-resistant MM. Therefore, we propose that the critical mediator of IMiD resistance is conversion to a cell state where MYC expression is Ikaros axis independent. This suggests targeting MYC directly or via the as yet uncharacterized mechanism controlling MYC may be an effective strategy to eradicate IMiD resistant MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b41beb4a-3cee-483d-869e-717f10ef80f7\/@z03B8ZEf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Drug resistance,Tumor heterogeneity,Myc,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15993"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lorraine N.

Untreated, AML leads to death within months after first symptoms. Combinatorial chemotherapy, mostly using a pyrimidine analog together with an anthracycline, made this previously incurable disease medicable, and response to remission-inducing chemotherapy strongly correlates with patient outcome. Despite advances in treatment over the recent years, AML still has a poor prognosis with an average 5-year survival rate of 30%. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms predicting and affecting treatment efficacy is key to improve disease control and outcome. Here we studied the expression, prognostic relevance and functional role of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor (NF)-&#954;B (RANK) in AML.<b> <\/b>We conducted an experimental <i>ex vivo<\/i> study using leukemic cells of 54 AML patients.

We further found that RANK signaling induced the release of the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF and IL-10 acting as growth and survival factors for the leukemic cells and mediated resistance of AML cells to treatment with doxorubicin and cytarabine, the most commonly used cytostatic compounds in AML treatment. In line, prevalence of RANK expression on leukemic cells correlated with dismal disease course of patients as revealed by reduced overall survival.<b> <\/b>Together, our results show that RANK plays a yet unrecognized role in AML pathophysiology and resistance to treatment.

Venetoclax (VEN), a BH3 mimetic that selectively targets the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, is FDA approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), with clinical trials underway for other lymphoid malignancies. Despite the clinical efficacy of VEN monotherapy, complete remission and progression free rates are still relatively low, thereby indicating the existence of inherent or acquired mechanisms of resistance. Preclinically, increases in anti-apoptotic BCL2 and MCL1 phosphorylation (BCL2-P\/MCL1-P) and MCL1 protein level have been implicated in chemoresistance. We therefore question if phosphorylation of these proteins may drive VEN resistance and if removing this modification may re-sensitize resistant cells to VEN induced cell death.<br \/><b>Methodology: <\/b>BH3 profiling (a functional assay that assesses mitochondrial apoptotic priming and anti-apoptotic protein dependence), western blot and cell death assays were performed.<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> We report that VEN acquired resistant DLBCL cell line (OCI-Ly1R) has increased BCL2-P, MCL1-P and MCL1 protein levels as compared to sensitive parental cell line (OCI-Ly1S), while inherently resistant DHL cell line (Su-DHL4) possesses higher MCL1-P and MCL1 protein levels as compared to OCI-Ly1S. We further show that this increase in phosphorylation status contributes to the induction of VEN resistance. Using BH3 profiling, we demonstrate that anti-apoptotic protein phosphorylation-driven VEN resistance involves a change in sensitivity to pro-apoptotic proteins, with an increase in sensitivity to MCL1 inhibition and reciprocal decrease in sensitivity to BCL2 inhibition.<br \/>We further show that BCL2 and MCL1 dephosphorylation by PP2A activating drugs (PADs) re-sensitizes resistant cells to VEN treatment. Mechanistically, PADs such as the fingolimod (FTY720) not only dephosphorylate BCL2-P and MCL1-P, but also dissociate BAX from BCL2 and destabilize MCL1 protein. These changes lead to the rewiring of cellular sensitivity to BCL2 inhibition, thereby re-sensitizing both VEN acquired and inherent resistant cells to VEN induced cell death. Importantly, the PP2A activating effects of FTY720 were recapitulated in primary cells from the peripheral blood of 16 CLL patients, where FTY720 treatment also reduced BCL2-P, MCL1-P and MCL1 protein levels and dissociated BAX from BCL2. This led to an increased sensitivity to BCL2 inhibition and enhanced cell death upon combined treatment with FTY720 and VEN.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our work defines a new targetable mechanism of VEN resistance in lymphoid malignancies due to the phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins. PADs re-sensitize resistant malignant cells to VEN treatment via dephosphorylation of anti-apoptotic proteins, suggesting a promising combination approach to explore further.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e892026d-c936-47e0-9df4-5d41d2f7f586\/@z03B8ZEf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Protein phosphatase,Venetoclax,Bcl-2 protein family,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15997"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen J.

To date, these therapies are generally given continuously, indefinitely, leading to the development of resistance, which is often on target. Venetoclax is the first-in-class BCL-2 inhibitor which was initially approved for continuous therapy in relapsed high-risk CLL. In that context the BCL-2<i> <\/i>G101V mutation (mut) was identified in post-progression samples and shown to reduce venetoclax binding to BCL-2, limiting its efficacy. The mut can be identified at low variant allele frequency (VAF) prior to clinical progression. We were therefore interested to identify the frequency of this mut in our cohort of relapsed refractory CLL patients (pts) on continuous venetoclax, and to assess the sensitivity of measurements in blood vs bone marrow. To this end we utilized a ddPCR assay which has LNA probes that specifically bind to either the <i>BCL2<\/i> G101wt or G101V sequences, to screen for G101V muts in DNA extracted from patient samples. We also started to investigate additional co-occurring <i>BCL2<\/i> muts in G101V positive samples by Sanger sequencing.<br \/>Our patient cohort included 28 pts, of whom 20 had serial samples collected during venetoclax therapy. The median age of the pts was 66, and they had a median of 3 prior therapies before venetoclax, including chemoimmunotherapy in 67.9% and a BTK inhibitor in 60.7%. Deletion of 17p was present in 43%, with five additional pts having isolated TP53 mut (total with known TP53 aberrancy, 61%). 75% (21\/28) of those evaluated had an unmutated IGHV. The median duration of venetoclax treatment was 43.5 months (mos). The timing of the first sample tested was a median of 23.3 mos after venetoclax initiation.<br \/>We detected the G101V allele in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 9 out of 28 pts, at a median allele frequency (AF) of 1.38% (range 0.04%-22.31%), at a median of 44.6 mos on venetoclax. Out of the three pts who had G101V detected at multiple timepoints, two had AF increased with time (7.8 fold increase over 6 mos and 7.7 fold increase over 5 mos, respectively), one had similar AF with time (4.68% at 18.9 mos, 3.43% at 23.8 mos on treatment). Six of these pts also had bone marrow evaluated and all were also positive (at a median AF of 0.21%; range 0.2%-18.66%); one additional patient without a PBMC sample at that timepoint was positive in bone marrow. In order to screen for any co-occurring acquired resistance muts in BCL2 G101V positive samples, we performed Sanger sequencing across the <i>BCL2<\/i> open-reading frame. We have identified a duplication mut (R107-R110dup) in one of the samples.<br \/><i> <\/i> In conclusion, this study shows that approximately one-third of pts on continuous venetoclax for 2+ years develop evidence of low-level BCL-2 G101V mut. Further work is underway to identify additional co-existing muts in <i>BCL2<\/i> or other genes, and to characterize the additional genetic events at the time of clear clinical progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3dc54ccc-df28-4443-ab64-110d8d2a8f7c\/@z03B8ZEf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Venetoclax,Bcl-2 protein family,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15998"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanan Kuang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stacey M.

Both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of drug resistance have been reported in literature; however, whether these mechanisms are stochastically selected in individual tumors or governed by a predictable underlying principle is unknown.Here, we report that one can predict a priori the resistance mechanism that will arise in individual SMO inhibitor (SMOi)-resistant SHH medulloblastoma (MB), based on different CSC phenotypes in each tumor. We show that the dependence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), not bulk tumor cells, on the targeted pathway (sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway) determines the molecular mechanism of resistance in individual tumors. Using both spontaneous (<i>Fsmo;GFAP-cre<\/i>) and transplantable (<i>Ptch<sup>+\/-<\/sup>;p53<\/i>) mouse models of SHH MB treated with a Smoothened inhibitor, sonidegib\/LDE225, we show that genetic-based resistance occurs only when the CSCs depend on the targeted pathway. In contrast, SHH MBs containing SHH-dependent bulk tumor cells but SHH-independent CSCs (SI-CSCs), acquire resistance through epigenetic reprogramming. Mechanistically, we discovered that the elevated proteasome activity in SMOi-resistant SI-CSC MBs alters the tumor cell maturation trajectory through enhanced degradation of specific epigenetic regulators, including the histone acetylation machinery. Consequently, SMOi-resistant SI- SMOi-resistant SI-CSC exhibit a global reduction of H3K9Ac, H3K14Ac, H3K56Ac, H4K5Ac, and H4K8Ac marks and gene expression changes. These results provide new insights into how selective pressure on distinct tumor cell populations contributes to different mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies and implicate histone acetylation in the process. This information can be clinically exploited to understand responses and resistance to SMOis and other targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6852384f-b53b-47be-afd5-84c0ddc3bad7\/@z03B8ZEf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Drug resistance,Cancer stem cell,Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16068"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Joshy George<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yaohui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Nourhan Abdelfattah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keiko Yamamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Adamson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jong Min Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brad Rybinski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anuj Srivastava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Parveen Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Gyu Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David S.

Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) is characterized by a fusion protein PAX3-FKHR, whereas embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma (FN-RMS), which is the focus of this project, is more genetically heterogeneous. The prognosis for RMS has improved over the years, however the cure rates for recurrent or relapse disease remains dismal, warranting further identification of novel therapeutic interventions, which is the aim of this project. To this end, we performed two CRISPR knockout screens, using a kinome sgRNA library and a whole genome sgRNA library in combination with etoposide at a concentration of IC<sub>10, <\/sub>in order to identify genes that might confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, the kinome screen was also designed to identify essential genes by using the treatment control samples as further time points. For treatment associated genes, we identified components of the JNK\/P38 and Hippo signaling pathways among the top hits. We also found enrichment of a novel pathway involving HIF&#945; stabilization via the genes LRRK2 and PTK6. Further and as expected, many DNA damage repair pathways were enriched. Finally in this category, players of the Wnt signaling pathway including JNK1, which is involved in non-canonical Wnt signaling were found to be enriched. As for essential gene identification, many cell cycle genes such as CDK6, PLK3 and PLK4 were among the top hits, as well as WEE1, which has been implicated in the context of RMS, were common between all the time points. Taken together, the CRISPR screens identified potential pathways that might be involved in resistance of FN-RMS cells towards etoposide. Selected candidates are being validated via an <i>in vitro<\/i> competition assay and drug screening is being performed to identify inhibitors that could be used to re-sensitize cells to treatment with standard chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8254c33c-19bd-4cf0-b3ea-1ac805f84cc1\/@z03B8ZEf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Drug resistance,Pediatric cancers,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16069"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Devmini C.

Despite being a very rare cancer that accounts for only 0.5-2% if all childhood cancer cases, HB has the largest increase in incidence among childhood cancers in the United States and worldwide. The five-year survival rate of children with the aggressive forms of HB, including those that have developed metastatic or recurrent diseases, is less than 40% due to the lack of effective treatment. We aim to identify targetable mechanisms underlying the progression and drug resistance of high-risk HB.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><i> <\/i>Our recent work on HB mouse and organoid models, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and primary patient samples revealed a significant upregulation of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) subunit M2 (RRM2) in high-risk HB. RNR is the sole enzymatic complex in mammal cells that converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and plays a critical role in regulating cell division and DNA repair. We found standard chemotherapy agents as well as two RRM2 inhibitors, triapine and MK1775, were capable of reducing <i>RRM2<\/i> expression effectively in vitro. However, we found a significant induction of another RNR subunit M2B (RRM2B) in treated cells in corresponding to RRM2 reduction. While no changes in drug response were noticed in <i>RRM2B<\/i> knockout (KO) HB cells. RRM2B levels in HB cells showed a strong impact on cells&#8217; ability to recover after chemotherapy. <i>RRM2B<sup>OE<\/sup> <\/i>HB cells showed a significant increase in their colony formation potential after chemotherapy where <i>RRM2B<sup>KO <\/sup><\/i>cells formed much fewer colonies after treatment compared to the control cells. Interestingly, we noticed a reversed subunit switch from RRM2B to RRM2 during the recovery period when cell proliferation was restored. RRM2, indeed, had a much higher enzymatic activity in converting ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides than RRM2B and promoted cell growth much more efficiently than RRM2B when both were overexpressed in HB cells. Finally, combining the RRM2 inhibitor MK1775 with standard chemotherapy in HB PDX models, although showing no additional benefit in reducing tumor size, significantly delayed tumor relapse after drug withdrawal.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b><i> <\/i>In this study, we demonstrated an intriguing switching between two RNR subunits, RRM2 and RRM2B in HB cells undergoing drug treatment and during their recovery afterwards. Our data suggest that RRM2 supports HB growth while its switching to RRM2B is critical to tumor cell survival under drug treatment. When tumor relapses, there is a reversed subunit switch from RRM2B to RRM2 to supports the recurrent growth of the tumor, which can serve as a potential therapeutic target in preventing HB relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c91f0efa-01ff-4984-878d-f06d474c9212\/@A03B8ZEg\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Liver cancer,Ribonucleotide reductase,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16070"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anthony Ray Christian Brown<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilie Indersie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaina Porter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baranda Hansen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liyuan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiyan Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shondra Miller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junmin Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefano Cairo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liqin Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Among acquired mutations, those proximal to BH3 binding motifs (e.g., <i>G101V<\/i>, <i>D103E<\/i>, and <i>V156D<\/i>) have the most significant impact on BCL-2 binding to BH3-only prodeath proteins and BH3 mimetics (e.g., venetoclax). Hence, it is important to identify novel therapeutics that address this emerging unmet need. To this end, we investigated the effect of co-targeting BCL-2 and MDM2-p53 apoptosis pathways in preclinical models of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with <i>BCL-2<\/i> mutations. We first genetically engineered cell lines that express clinically relevant <i>BCL-2<\/i> gene mutations in ALL cell line RS4;11, which shows greater expression of mutants, compared to endogenous wild-type BCL-2 protein. Relative to parental cells, sensitivity to venetoclax and investigational, clinical-stage BCL-2 inhibitor lisaftoclax (APG-2575) in mutant cell lines was reduced 160-fold. Using these BCL-2-inhibitor-resistant cell lines, we assessed the effect of combining lisaftoclax with investigational, clinical-stage MDM2-p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin (APG-115). Alrizomadlin inhibits the MDM2-p53 interaction and activates the prodeath p53 tumor suppressor signaling pathways (Aguilar A et al. J Med Chem 2017). Also potentially consequential was the observation that combining alrizomadlin with lisaftoclax synergistically inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in RS4:11 cells carrying <i>G101V<\/i>, <i>V156D<\/i>, or <i>D103E<\/i> mutations. Treatment with this combination also synergistically enhanced antitumor activity in mouse xenograft tumor models derived from RS4:11 cells carrying <i>G101V<\/i> or <i>V156D<\/i> mutations. In these animal models, lisaftoclax alone exhibited no or limited activity, with T\/C (%; i.e., relative tumor volume of treatment group vs. control) values ranging from 86.40% to 99.15%. In contrast, single-agent alrizomadlin exerted slightly more potent activity, with T\/C values ranging from 57.25% to 62.35%. Importantly, the combination of lisaftoclax and alrizomadlin demonstrated synergy, with T\/C values ranging from 12.30% to 32.16%. Mechanistically, alrizomadlin likely induced expression of prodeath BCL-2 family proteins BAX, PUMA, and Noxa, which are p53 target genes. Further, lisaftoclax plus alrizomadlin more effectively blocked cell cycle entry into the G2\/M phase, resulting in accumulation of sub-G1 apoptotic cells. In summary, our study demonstrates, for the first time, that co-targeting BCL-2 and MDM2-p53 apoptosis pathways overcame resistance to BCL-2 inhibitors conferred by acquired <i>BCL-2 <\/i>gene mutations, potentially offering a viable strategy to overcome drug resistance and thus providing a rationale for clinical investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7303fccb-9cba-46ff-b4e8-c54af151af9c\/@A03B8ZEg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDM2,Alrizomadlin,Lisaftoclax,BCL-2 resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16071"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jing Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaixiang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiuqiong Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaojing Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qixin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Douglas D.

Histone H3 is mutated in 80% of DIPGs, dictating tumor location, onset, and outcome of this devastating disease. Therapeutic resistance remains a major obstacle to preventing tumor recurrence and is in part driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs), which exhibit self-renewal properties and tumorigenic potential. In previous studies, we have identified these proliferative and tumorigenic features in aldehyde dehydrogenase positive (ALDH+) CSCs in H3K27M mutant DIPG. Among the 19 ALDH isoforms known in humans, aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A3 (ALDH1A3) is most highly expressed in malignant cells when compared to immune cells or oligodendrocytes in H3K27M DIPG biopsies, indicating an important mechanistic role in regulating stemness in DIPG. We hypothesize that ALDH-mediated cancer stemness and resistance may in part be driven by H3K27M. Indeed, ALDH1A3 expression was dramatically reduced in CRISPR-edited DIPG cells where the H3K27M mutation had been removed (H3K27M-KO). Furthermore, these cells lost their neurosphere forming potential, began to express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and attached to the plastic, changes indicative of differentiation. Transcriptomic and GSEA pathway analyses suggested Wnt-dependent regulation of ALDH1A3, with Wnt 7b and Wnt 11 demonstrating the largest difference in the isogenic DIPGs. In addition, DNA repair, along with PI3K\/AKT and Wnt signaling, were found to be upregulated upon radiation of DIPG cells, indicating future therapeutic opportunities to prevent radio resistance. We have co-targeted these cell-intrinsic vulnerabilities to eradicate CSCs in DIPG and prevent tumor recurrence, using a combination of radiotherapy, the PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor GDC-0084 and the ALDH inhibitor Disulfiram. This combination has produced an exquisite synergy in cells, which we will test in clinically-relevant DIPG models. Taken together, through these studies we have gained mechanistic insight into H3K27M mediated regulation of cancer cell stemness and differentiation in DIPG, which appears to be mediated by Wnt-dependent signaling of ALDH1A3 and provides rationale for exploring new therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b116ca9b-10c8-4fa1-b7cd-e89d12be42f0\/@A03B8ZEg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cell,Drug resistance,Akt,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16072"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Monika Sharma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Magnuson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeanette Cruz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>McKenzie Kauss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Buschhaus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mats Ljungman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Galban<\/i><\/presenter>.

Currently available therapies do not prevent tumor recurrence in nearly all patients diagnosed with this devastating disease. Innovative combinatorial therapies that penetrate the blood brain barrier and effectively lead to long-term control of tumor growth are desperately needed.<br \/>Using RNA sequencing, we identified mechanisms of resistance of DIPG to radiotherapy (RT) standard of care. Not surprisingly, RT leads to upregulation of DNA repair and PI3K-mTOR signaling. Our team has rationally designed a brain-penetrant small molecule that is a highly selective inhibitor of EGFR and PI3 kinase family members, including the DNA repair protein DNA-PK. This molecule, MTX-241F, developed at the University of Michigan, is an excellent candidate to target the compensatory escape mechanisms leading to radioresistance and drug evasion of DIPG. Due to achievement of micromolar levels of MTX-241F in mouse brain tissue, we anticipate that this development candidate will be highly efficacious and considerably more effective than predecessor combination therapies tested against DIPG.<br \/>Preliminary studies carried out in patient derived DIPG neurospheres show that MTX-241F exhibits promising signs of single agent activity efficacy and radiosensitizing activity in the combination setting. The physiochemical properties of MTX-241F include remarkably high exposure in the brain, indicating efficient blood brain barrier penetrance. Since radiotherapy results in double strand breaks which are repaired by both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ), we have also tested the combination of MTX-241F with an inhibitor of ATM, to achieve blockade of HR and NHEJ, respectively in the absence or presence of radiotherapy. When the HR blockers were combined with MTX-241F and radiotherapy synthetic lethality was observed in clonogenic assays, providing impetus to explore combination of HR blockers with this novel first-in-class kinase inhibitor and radiotherapy in clinically relevant models of DIPG.<br \/>In summary, our data provide proof of concept evidence to support the rapid clinical development of MTX-241F for the treatment of DIPG. Future studies have been designed to inform rapid clinical translation to ultimately impact patients diagnosed with this devastating disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/987b8850-2fb4-440d-893a-4a2357bbbfdf\/@A03B8ZEg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair inhibition,Drug resistance,Pediatric cancers,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16128"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Monika Sharma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Mumby<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Varunkumar Krishnamoorthy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Magnuson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mats Ljungman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Whitehead<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Sebolt-Leopold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Galban<\/i><\/presenter>.

Relapse suggest that MM cells that are resistant to chemotherapy and have the clonogenic growth potential to produce tumor cells exist, and we have found that tumor cells lacking the plasma cell antigen CD138 are enriched in these properties. Understanding the mechanisms regulating these MM cancer stem cells (CSCs) may lead to novel targeting strategies.<br \/>Aberrant translation is a widespread characteristic of tumor cells and plays a major role in drug resistance. Thus, therapeutic agents that target translation hold promise as novel anti-cancer drugs. MM cells are characterized by heightened protein production in the form of immunoglobulin (Ig) and are highly dependent on proteolytic pathways such as the proteasome to maintain protein homeostasis. As a consequence, proteasome inhibitors (PIs) such as bortezomib (BTZ) have been established as a frontline therapy for the disease. Immature plasma cells with diminished Ig production are resistant to BTZ, and patients with low Ig producing tumors are more likely to relapse. Therefore, low protein synthesis may confer growth advantages to cancer cells such as chemoresistance and enhanced tumor regrowth potential.<br \/><b>Methods &#38; Results: <\/b>To examine alterations in the translational landscape in therapy resistant MM, we treated MM cells with BTZ, and found that eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5 (eIF5) was highly upregulated. Importantly, over-expression of eIF5 led to increased chemotherapy resistance and enhanced clonogenicity. <i>O<\/i>-propargyl-puromycin incorporation showed a global translational reduction in cells over-expressing eIF5. Matched transcriptional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling revealed that a subset of genes, including <i>MSI2<\/i> and <i>EZH1,<\/i> escaped translation suppression by maintaining efficient translation in eIF5 over-expressing cells. In addition, clonogenic (CD138<sup>neg<\/sup>) MM cells exhibited increased eIF5 expression and decreased protein synthesis.<br \/><b>Discussion: <\/b>Understanding the mechanisms of chemoresistance in the cell populations responsible for residual disease and re-growth may lead to novel targeting strategies. Recent studies have indicated that stem cell behavior is coupled to protein synthesis regulation. However, the role of translational control in the maintenance of tumor-initiating cells has been explored only recently. Studies have implicated deregulation of initiation factors in various types of cancer. However, the role of eIF5 in cancer remains elusive. Our data reveals, for the first time, a novel eIF5-directed translational program that enhances chemoresistance and tumor-initiating potential in MM cells, making it a promising therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapy resistance,Multiple myeloma,Cancer stem cell,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16119"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kiera Rycaj<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun-Hee Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tori Tonn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiuju Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Can Cenik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Gocke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Matsui<\/i><\/presenter>.

Internal tandem duplication mutations (ITD) confer a poor prognosis on FLT3\/ITD patients, making FLT3\/ITD AML susceptible to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, FLT3 TKI success has been hindered by mechanisms of resistance including adaptive resistance, in which downstream signaling pathways are rapidly reactivated after initial inhibition with targeted therapies. Past work has shown that FLT3\/ITD cells undergo adaptive resistance through the reactivation of ERK signaling within 24 hours of sustained FLT3 inhibition. We are interested in finding the mechanisms responsible for this ERK reactivation.<br \/>AXL is a RTK that is implicated in acquired resistance for many cancers, including against targeted therapy in FLT3\/ITD AML. However, AXL signaling has not been implicated in early adaptive resistance in the context of FLT3\/ITD AML. Thus, we sought to determine if AXL plays a role in the ERK reactivation found in TKI-treated AML cells.<br \/>To address this, we first treated FLT3\/ITD cell lines (Molm14 and MV4;11) with FLT3 TKI for 24 hours and saw an increase in AXL protein and mRNA levels as early as 4 hours after starting treatment. AXL phosphorylation occurred as early as 16 hours, which coincides with the beginning of the ERK phosphorylation (pERK) rebound. Further characterization revealed AXL upregulation, like ERK reactivation, is at least partially serum-dependent and that the ERK reactivation itself is not causing the AXL induction. These results established that TKI-induced AXL activation is associated with the adaptive ERK reactivation.<br \/>To determine if AXL signaling actually plays a role in ERK reactivation in FLT3\/ITD AML, we inhibited AXL activation using both small-molecule inhibitors (TP-0903 and R428) and selective inhibition (shRNA knockdown and ligand trapping with an AXL chimeric protein) concurrently with FLT3 TKI treatment. Each method of AXL inhibition diminished the pERK rebound, decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis of FLT3 TKI-treated FLT3\/ITD cells. Combined AXL and FLT3 inhibition also suppressed leukemic cell recovery even after brief treatment exposure. Furthermore, 24-hour FLT3 and AXL TKI treatments of both relapsed and newly-diagnosed FLT3\/ITD patient leukemic samples yielded the same upregulation of AXL protein and decreased pERK rebound observed in the cell lines.<br \/>In summation, FLT3 TKI treatment causes rapid AXL upregulation resulting in adaptive ERK reactivation. Concurrent FLT3 and AXL inhibition diminishes pERK rebound and sensitives FLT3\/ITD cells to TKI treatment. This data suggests that AXL plays a role in adaptive resistance in FLT3\/ITD AML, and the addition of AXL inhibition to FLT3 TKI treatment has the potential to improve FLT3\/ITD patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/78484f63-ed85-404f-9632-8d60b8011133\/@A03B8ZEg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"FLT3,Axl,Resistance,Signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16120"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tessa Seale<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaesung Seo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bao Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Levis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Pratilas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donald Small<\/i><\/presenter>.

Approximately 30% of AML patients carry mutations in the type III receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3. The most common form of FLT3 mutations includes internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations, which are also associated with poor clinical outcomes. Several inhibitors of FLT3 have been developed and are under clinical trials. Major problems in targeting FLT3-ITD include acquired resistance to the inhibitors which is mediated by secondary point mutations in FLT3. The activity of many, but not all, tyrosine kinases is dependent on the well-conserved tyrosine residue in the activation loop for receptor activation. For instance, we have recently shown that the KIT receptor is dependent on its activation loop tyrosine for downstream signaling and receptor stability, but not for the activation of the receptor. In many AML patients, FLT3-ITD mutations in combination with mutations in the activation loop tyrosine residue (Y842) result in drug resistance. We therefore stably transduced cells with FLT3-ITD in combination with different Y842 mutants (Y842C and Y842F). Using MM-PBSA, we found that the introduction of the Y842C and Y842F point mutations changed the binding energy of the FLT3 inhibitors quizartinib, sorafenib, and midostaurin<i> in silico<\/i>. In addition, the mutants displayed a change in drug response and apoptosis levels after treatments with FLT3 inhibitors <i>in vitro<\/i>. Previous data from our lab also shows that the Y842F mutant resulted in delayed tumor formation <i>in vivo, <\/i>indicating that the phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine is an important event in FLT3-ITD-mediated transformation. All in all, our data suggest that the activation loop tyrosine residue in FLT3-ITD positive cells plays an important role in drug response and tumor formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/811a5c86-1fdb-4c6e-8308-32728f123070\/@A03B8ZEg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"FLT3,Resistance,Mutations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16121"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lina Al Ashiri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sausan Moharram<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rituraj Purohit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julhash Kazi Uddin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Rönnstrand<\/i><\/presenter>.

T cell-engaging therapies, such as T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), are raising extraordinary expectations as future treatments for virtually all cancers. Encouraging these expectations, TCBs and CARs have been recently approved to treat some hematologic malignancies. In contrast, TCBs and CARs against solid tumors tested to date, have failed to show clinical efficacy. This failure prompted intense research and the subsequent identification of mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance. Different strategies are being implemented to overcome these mechanisms of resistance. All these mechanisms impinge on the ability of T cells to reach cancer cells and\/or on the inhibition of T cells. However, little is known about putative intrinsic mechanisms of resistance of cancer cells. That is, mechanisms deployed by tumor cells to resist killing by fully active and correctly engaged T cells. Using in vitro and in vivo acquired resistant models to TCBs and CARs directed against HER2, we demonstrate that disruption in interferon-gamma (IFN-g) signaling in cancer cells is a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to killing by fully active, correctly engaged, T lymphocytes. Importantly, we have identified that the kinase JAK2, which transduces the signal initiated by IFN-g, is the component preferably disrupted to acquired resistance across all models used. These results unveil a novel mechanism of resistance to T-cell based therapies, and imply the potential use of JAK2 and IFN-g response as a surrogate biomarker of response to immunotherapies. In addition, they open the avenue for the screening for therapies that can overcome deficient interferon-gamma response or restore JAK2 levels, which are promising potential candidates to increase the benefits of immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Chimeric antigen receptor,Interferons,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16122"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alex Martínez-Sabadell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enrique J.

Therapeutic target identification in OS has been extremely challenging due to the high degree of heterogeneity in its genetic profile and lack of specific oncogenic driver genes. Despite extensive research efforts, the treatment and survival outcomes for OS patients have stagnated over the past 30 years. OS remains a lethal cancer due to metastasis and development of resistance to current chemotherapies. Study of chemo-resistance mechanisms and identification of novel targets that can be used in combination therapy are therefore critical to improve OS treatment. The combination of gene essentiality concept and clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats-associated nuclease Cas9 (CRISPR\/Cas9) functional knockout screen is an ideal new strategy to address the genetic complexity and drug-resistance in OS. A gene is considered essential if it is critical for reproductive success in an organism under specified condition. The recent introduction of genome editing using the CRISPR\/Cas9 system with pooled library of guided RNAs (gRNAs) makes it feasible to systematically identify the genes required for the proliferation. By comparing the fold change of gRNA abundance in the surviving population of cells relative to the initial population, the essential genes under different settings can be identified.As a novel therapeutic approach for identifying combination therapies for OS, we conducted genome-wide (GW) CRISPR\/Cas9 screen in SaOS2 OS cell lines parallel with RNA-sequencing in different conditions (control, Cisplatin, Doxorubicin), followed by gene essentiality score calculation. Cisplatin (CIS) and Doxorubicin (DOX) combination is among those commonly used as first-line therapies for OS treatment. The objective of our studies is to bring forth new perspectives in target identification and chemo-resistance study for OS. The gene targets and pathways that become more essential for OS cell proliferation in the presence of chemo drugs were revealed. Drugs specific for some of these target could then be added to the established CIS or DOX regimen to overcome existing drug resistance. On the other hand, the genes that become less essential after treatment could provide additional chemo-resistant mechanisms. Multiple gene targets were identified in the screen. Among these, we&#8217;ve successfully identified and validated Berzosertib, an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase inhibitor (ATRi), as a synergistic lethality partner to Cisplatin in vitro for OS treatment. Efficacy and safety measurement of Berzosertib and Cisplatin combination therapy in an OS xenograft mouse model and in several OS patient-derived xenograft models is in progress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/44b99057-dcea-4608-8482-99b27c3cf622\/@A03B8ZEg\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,CRISPR\/Cas9,Chemoresistance,ATR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16123"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shan Tang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen E.

A small fraction of leukemic cells that withstand chemotherapeutic insult can rewire cellular processes to re-emerge with lethal disease. Approaches to decipher drug resistance mechanisms in these drug persister cells can pave the way for newer therapies and improve survival in patients. To uncover drug resistant mechanisms that are clinically relevant, we generated in-house Cytarabine (AraC) and Arsenic trioxide (ATO) resistant cells from na&#239;ve MV4-11 AML cell line by incremental dose exposure method. Single cell clones were generated from AraC (MV411-AraC-R) \/ATO (MV411-ATO-R) drug tolerant cells. Both the AraC-R and ATO-R clones were resistant to AraC (600-fold) and ATO (2-fold) respectively compared to the na&#239;ve cells. AraC-R cells were marginally cross resistant to daunorubicin (DNR) and ATO. Interestingly, the ATO-R cells were highly cross resistant to both AraC (600-fold) and DNR (4-fold) demonstrating altered drug resistance mechanism. We next subjected the AraC-R, ATO-R and the na&#239;ve cells to RNAseq analysis to identify transcriptomic changes post resistance development. 1218 transcripts in AraC-R cells and 7654 transcripts in ATO-R cells were differentially expressed compared to the na&#239;ve cells, suggesting ATO exposure alters the transcriptome drastically compared to AraC. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with these differentially expressed gene signatures. AraC-R gene signatures were highly enriched (NES-2.8 &#38; 2.0 FDR-0.00) for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial related signatures, consistent with previous report suggesting AraC exposed residual cells are highly enriched for oxidative phosphorylation and are not enriched for stemness gene signatures (Farge et al). ATO-R gene signatures were positively enriched (NES- 2.0 &#38; 1.4 FDR 0.005 &#38; 0.03) for Leukemic stem cell gene signatures (Eppert_LSC and Gentles_LSC) and relapse (NES- 2.0 &#38; 1.5 FDR 0.0 &#38; 0.01) gene signatures (CALCRL_RIC and Hackles_relapse) and negatively enriched for mitochondrial gene signatures showing reduced reliance on mitochondrial metabolism. Since AraC-R cells showed high dependency on mitochondrial metabolism, we treated these cells with venetoclax (VEN) a known oxphos inhibitor for 48 hours and assessed the viability. Ven markedly sensitized the AraC-R cells compared to na&#239;ve cells (IC50 13nM and 323nM), while ATO-R cells were markedly resistant to Ven (IC50 8049nM) corroborating our transcriptomic findings. These finding suggest transcriptome profiling of in-vitro modelled drug resistant cell lines can mimic clinically relevant drug resistant mechanism and could aide in identifying alternate therapies to circumvent disease relapse. Further metabolomic characterization and mechanistic studies are ongoing to substantiate these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6e662577-b64d-4d41-9c33-42c52a224dbd\/@B03B8ZEh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Differential gene expression,Metabolism,Resistance,Stemness,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16125"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Raveen Stephen Stallon Illangeswaran<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Zechariah Paul Jebanesan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kezia Kanimozhi Sivakumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakhi Thalayattu Vidhyadharan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vikram Mathews<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaji Ramachandran Velayudhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Poonkuzhali Balasubramanian<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, when treating advanced or metastatic disease toxicity, side effects, and acquired resistance often limit the duration of therapy. While randomized control trials have traditionally served as the proving ground for first and subsequent line therapies, rare tumor subtypes including soft tumor sarcoma (STS) provide unique challenges for developing robust treatment data. By developing human based <i>in vitro<\/i> models, we can investigate potential therapeutic mechanisms for STS. Fibrosarcoma is one distinct histologic STS subtype that relies heavily on anthracycline treatment in the first line setting, however, there are limited options once resistance develops. Anthracyclines, including doxorubicin, exert their effect through a variety of mechanisms including reactive oxygen species, DNA-adduct formation, and inhibiting topoisomerase II, histone eviction, calcium and iron homeostasis, and ceramide overproduction. However, there have also been multiple mechanisms of doxorubicin resistance including disruption of cell membrane, alteration of cell surface molecules, inactivation of drugs, gene amplification, activating alternative signaling pathways, and affecting cellular repair mechanisms. In order to investigate the role of anthracycline resistance in fibrosarcoma lines we acquired two human derived fibrosarcoma lines SW684 and HT-1080 from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Characterization of HT-1080 using publicly available datasets demonstrated that TP53, CDK2NA and NF1 serve as major driver mutations while SW684 relies on NRAS and IDH1 mutations. We further characterized these cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and noted that HT-1080 has a quick doubling time of 16 hours while SW684 has a doubling time of 91 hours. Additionally, after doxorubicin treatment, we found that HT-1080 is sensitive with an IC50 of 5.594 nanomolar while SW684 is relatively doxorubicin resistant with an IC50 of 28.915 micromolar. While proliferative rate may play a role in the sensitivities of these cell lines further characterization of the mechanism leading to doxorubicin resistance is needed. To that end, we are using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach for further genome wide screening of these fibrosarcoma lines in the presence of doxorubicin. Exploring the genetic mechanisms that result in development of doxorubicin resistance may reveal novel, targetable mechanisms expanding treatment durability in this rare STS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9a921cbd-b2e5-4496-ab09-21c972aa7ef2\/@B03B8ZEh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Chemoresistance,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16127"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rodney Dixon Dorand Jr.<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donna Dang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth J.

In order to elucidate the clonal emergence of resistance to targeted and cytotoxic chemotherapy in osteosarcoma we have worked on barcoding our cell lines derived from patient derived xenograft (PDX) models.<br \/>Methods: The cell lines were derived from the PDX models by disaggregation and serial culture using STR to confirm the identity of each of the derived cell lines. The cell lines were barcoded using a lentiviral vector to transduce cells with a unique DNA transcript that was incorporated into the tumor cell genome. Two different cytoxicity assays, the Alamar Blu Cytotoxicity test in combination with the Incucyte&#174; Cytotxicity Assay protocol, were used to evaluate the resistance of the PDX cells to the drug Methotrexate (MTX) that is largely used in the treatment of this disease. Further evaluation of the clonality of the resistant cells will be performed by sequencing the barcodes which will be complemented by functional assays of MTX transport, metabolism and target inhibition.<br \/>Results: The PDX derived cell lines (n=10) were exposed to serial concentrations of MTX with different exposure durations obtaining the IC<sub>50<\/sub> (range 0.23-376 uM) and IC<sub>95<\/sub> (range 0.8- 4500 uM) for each PDX cell line. Subsequently every PDX cell line previously tested was exposed to the IC<sub>95<\/sub> of MTX, in the same conditions used before, in order to obtain clones resistant to MTX. Numerous clones (72 clones from 10 cell lines) have been obtained. For each clone DNA and RNA has been extracted in order to perform sequencing of the DNA barcoded to determine if the genomic signature of the resistant clones is present in a subpopulation at the onset of treatment and if resistance arises from Darwinian selection or from stochastic alterations during and potentially related to treatment lead to emergence of a new resistant phenotype. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) will suggest the pathway alterations that may be associated with the emergence of resistance. Functional assays of MTX resistance will further define the basis of the resistance that emerged.<br \/>Conclusion: Barcoded PDX derived osteosarcoma cell lines have been created with resistant clones obtained after MTX treatment. Sequencing of barcodes, RNA-Seq profiling and functional assays will yield critical information on the clonality and mechanisms of resistance which will be presented.

Frontline R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), used regardless of subtype, cures 60-70%. Patients failed by this combination have poor prognosis. Extensive efforts to improve on R-CHOP in the frontline have failed, but recent post-hoc analysis of one negative trial suggested younger patients with specific DLBCL biologic subtypes may benefit from addition of a Bruton&#8217;s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor (BTKi). These results could inform prospective studies in a small subset of DLBCL cases, but the rest lack biomarker-driven frontline optimizations. Newer classification systems define the BN2 (LymphGen) or Cluster 1 (Chapuy consensus clusters) subtype, characterized by <i>BCL6<\/i> translocations and\/or <i>NOTCH2<\/i> truncations. BN2 cases specifically saw no benefit from adding BTKi to R-CHOP regardless of patient age. <i>BCL10<\/i>, encoding a key protein promoting NF-kB activation through formation of a signaling complex with CARD11 and MALT1, is recurrently mutated in DLBCL (~5%), clustering strongly in BN2 (30-40%). We hypothesize that activation of NF-kB downstream of BTK due to BCL10 gain of function promotes BTKi resistant lymphomagenesis. Recurrent BCL10 mutations include the R58Q missense mutation in the oncogenic N-terminal CARD domain and frequent truncations of the regulatory C-terminal S\/T-rich domain. Overexpression of <i>BCL10<\/i> with either mutation type in DLBCL cells promoted strong activation of NF-kB assessed by immunoblotting and EGFP NF-kB reporters. Truncated BCL10 also increased MALT1 protease activity, measured by increased substrate cleavage. <i>BCL10<\/i> mutations drove resistance to BTKis as hypothesized, but there was no difference in sensitivity to MALT1 inhibition, revealing that downstream targets overcome drug resistance by BCL10 mutant-mediated activation. Combining MALT1i with BTKi synergistically killed cells, identifying a promising therapeutic strategy for BN2 cases. Delving into the mechanism of BCL10-mutant lymphomagenesis, gene ontology analysis of transcriptome data showed cross-activation of ERK1\/2 signaling, confirmed by immunoblotting, and strong induction of cytokine production and related signaling. To fuel future studies, we have established a cre-inducible conditional <i>BCL10<\/i>-truncation mouse model at the <i>ROSA26<\/i> locus in C57BL\/6J mice. After crossing into the Mb1-Cre background, these animals showed expansion of the B-cell compartment by three months of age and remain under observation for onset of lymphoma. We therefore define mechanisms and therapeutic consequences of recurrent <i>BCL10<\/i> mutations in DLBCL and provide new drug combinations aimed at overcoming them.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/51ab03c6-614a-4a0d-a604-e2e9ef128187\/@B03B8ZEh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Biomarkers,Molecular subtypes,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16134"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caroline A.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) had been reported to be effective in degrading the FLT3 protein in AML cell lines and sensitizing non-APL AML patient samples in-vitro (Liu et al. 2020). We have previously reported that primary cells from FLT3-ITD mutated AML patients were sensitive to ATO in-vitro compared to other non-M3 AML (Abraham et al, 2014) and molecular\/pharmacological inhibition of NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of antioxidant response mechanism improved the chemosensitivity to ATO and daunorubicin (Karathedath et al. 2017). Here we assessed the role of pharmacological inhibition of Nrf2 in modulating acquired resistance to ATO in an FLT3-ITD mutated AML cell line (MV4-11 ATO-R).MV4-11 cell line containing FLT3-ITD was made resistant to ATO (MV4-11 ATO-R) using incremental method and showed 2-fold increase in IC50 to ATO. The basal expression of Nrf2 transcript and protein levels were compared between MV4-11 (na&#239;ve) and MV4-11 ATO-R (resistant) cells using quantitative RTPCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence respectively. Mutations in the Keap1 gene were screened in naive and resistant cells by Sanger sequencing. The effect of known pharmacological inhibitor of Nrf2 (Digoxin (DIG)) in overcoming acquired resistance to ATO was tested by in-vitro cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays. Further, to identify the upstream activator of Nrf2, expression of Akt protein with and without DIG treatment was assessed by immunoblotting. Finally, the efficacy of Nrf2 inhibition by DIG in resistant cells were tested in a transplantable AML mice model.There was no significant increase in NRF2 RNA expression (&#60;2-fold) while there was a higher nuclear Nrf2 expression and localization as well as increased Akt protein expression in the resistant cells compared to na&#239;ve cells. DIG treatment reduced expression of Nrf2 resulting in improved sensitivity (IC50 ATO-3.5&#181;M vs ATO+DIG-2.05&#181;M) and increased apoptosis (&#8776;2 fold in apoptotic rates) to ATO in resistant cells. There was a reduction in Akt protein expression in DIG treated cells confirming that Nrf2 activation in the resistant cells is mediated by Akt. Treating AML mice with either DIG alone or in combination with ATO showed reduction in leukemic load and significant increase in overall median survival (26 &#38; 23 days, p&#60;0.001) when compared to untreated and ATO alone (20 &#38; 16 days).<br \/>Our study suggests that Nrf2 mediates acquired resistance to ATO in a FLT3-ITD mutated AML cell line. Inhibition of Nrf2 using a drug routinely used in the clinic was able to re-sensitize the resistant cells to ATO in-vitro and reduced leukemic burden in-vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4016dc6c-64b0-4672-8973-49246d8615e0\/@B03B8ZEh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Nrf2,Arsenic trioxide,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Zechariah Paul Jebanesan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raveen Stephen Stallon Illangeswaran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saswati Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakhi Thalayattu Vidhyadharan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nayanthara Karpillymoola Bijukumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bharathi M.
