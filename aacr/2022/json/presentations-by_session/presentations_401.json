[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Hyperlipidemia has been associated with increased risk of advanced stage and high Gleason grade prostate cancer (PCa), yet the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Quaking (QKI) is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that regulate lipid metabolism. For PCa, QKI overexpression has been associated with increased chance of metastatic recurrence.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> We performed RNA sequencing of prostate cancer tissues of hyperlipidemia (n = 12) and normolipidemia (n=32). Tissue samples were acquired by MRI-US fusion targeted biopsy. DESeq2 and GSEA was used to identify differently expressed genes and enriched genesets. A web-based RBP motif screening tool TRANSITE was utilized to identify active RBPs in hyperlipidemia-associated PCa.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>PCa samples of hyperlipidemia patients exhibited poorer histology than normolipidemia PCA. RNA sequencing found that hyperlipidemia-associated PCa is enriched of Myc-regulated genes as well as interferon or innate immunity-associated genes. Interestingly, hyperlipidemia-associated PCa gene expression signature identified PCa samples devoid of common PCa genetic alterations - TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and PTEN deletion\/mutation. RBP motif screening found QKI as one of the top enriched RBP in hyperlipidemia-associated PCa transcriptome. In a separate a consecutive radical prostatectomy series (n=190), we found that QKI-high (immunohistochemistry staining score 2-3) tumors had significantly higher serum cholesterol than QKI-low (score 0-1) tumors. Overexpression and knockdown experiments proved that QKI is responsible of rapid cell proliferation and interferon-related inflammatory gene expressions, <i>In silico <\/i>analysis predicted QKI overexpressing cancer cells are susceptive to stain-mediated ferroptosis-like cell death. Mechanistically, QKI regulates expression of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), which dictates the sensitivity of QKI overexpressing cells to ferroptosis.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Hyperlipidemia was associated with aggressive pathologic characteristics of PCa without TMPRSS2-ERG fusion or PTEN deletion\/mutation, and high tissue expression of QKI, an RNA-binding protein. QKI overexpression in PCa increased sensitivity to ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis by statins. This explains the epidemiological associations between hyperlipidemia and PCa, and will guide molecular subtype-driven drug repurposing studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a3203a42-70e1-43db-ab11-064084e5acb5\/@x03B8ZHt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,RNA-seq,Cholesterol,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16435"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hyun Ho Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jin Sol Sung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong Wook Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheol Keun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nam Hoon Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Deuk Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woo Jin Ko<\/i><\/presenter>.

Evaluating enrichment of specific gene groups and pathways, and visualizing these results is an important step to obtain inferences about patient treatment outcomes, overall survival, drug resistance and therapeutic targets.<br \/>However, pathway analysis of cancer patient samples in a N-of-1 setting without their respective control (normal) samples remains to be challenging. There is a crucial need for methods and tools to conduct and visualize pathway analysis results in this setting.<br \/>Methods and Results: Our method focuses on a visualization technique showing patient-specific pathway activation relative to reference populations from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX). Patient-specific pathway activity scores are displayed within the respective percentiles and averages of the TCGA and GTEX cohorts to visualize a patient's individual pathway activation profile within the TCGA tumor and GTEX normal reference population. Patient-specific pathway scores are derived from an individual patient's transcriptomic profile and transformed into activity scores for each of 14 cancer pathways. This allows for the comparison of an individual patient&#8217;s pathway activation profile with reference samples from TCGA and GTEX. We used PROGENy (Pathway RespOnsive GENes for activity inference) to calculate activity scores for the 14 cancer related pathways.<br \/>The pathway activity scores of each new tumor sample are scaled using the parameters of scaled pathway activity scores obtained from TCGA and GTEX gene expression data of all cancer tissue types. Finally we visualized the pathway activity scores of each patient sample.<br \/>Conclusion: Our visualization method is expected to unravel the activation patterns of each of the 14 cancer pathways in our patient samples. Specific pathway genes can then be evaluated in the patient samples to identify causal mutations and their associations with the pathway activity scores hence aid in treatment selection and in the further development of precision medicine therapeutic solutions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1da1bf59-9502-4db3-a6c9-d10cc84eb284\/@x03B8ZHt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression,Pathway,Mutations,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16436"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Padmapriya Swaminathan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Casey B.

It disproportionately affects Hispanics in the USA with an incidence and mortality rate about two to three times higher in Hispanics than in non-Hispanic whites. To identify molecular features associated with the Hispanic HCC we have generated genome-wide sequencing (i.e., exome-seq, RNA-seq) data and mass spectrometry-based proteomics data from HCC tumor and matched blood and\/or adjacent normal tissues of Hispanic patients based in South Texas. The landscape of somatic mutation in HCC tumors revealed the aflatoxin-induced mutational signature (COSMIC) in some patients indicating an association of aflatoxin mediated toxicity in them. Similar to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study, with predominant non-Hispanic HCC tumors, we could identify the most frequent somatic mutations in <i>CTNNB1<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i>. Other frequently (&#62;10%) mutated genes in our patients appear to be mutated at relatively lower rate in the TCGA patients. Mutation(s) in some of the frequently mutated genes might contribute to the significant enrichment of cellular signaling pathways observed from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using paired RNA-seq data. Single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) of our RNA-seq and proteomic data sets revealed two clusters of HCC tumors, denoted as H1 and H2 clusters, with striking differences in various signaling pathways and cellular functions. Patients from the H1 cluster and two sub-clusters within the H2 cluster showed a significant difference in their survival rate based on overall survival information from the TCGA study. The transcriptomic data from Hispanic &#38; non-Hispanic HCC identified activated immune evasion mechanisms in H1 patients. Sorafenib treatment was found to be associated with a lower hazard ratio for overall survival in patients from the H1 cluster compared to the H2 cluster. In sum, we have identified genes more frequently mutated in Hispanic HCC than in non-Hispanic HCC, and cellular and tissue functions significantly enriched only in the Hispanic HCC. We also report a novel classification of HCC tumors with significant differences in various cellular signaling pathways and overall survival. Our findings might be used as biomarkers for the early prediction and better therapeutic management of HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e3e3b6b3-ff78-4fdd-8bfb-a686006168e5\/@y03B8ZHu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Hispanic,Multiomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16437"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Debodipta Das<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaojing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Chiao Chiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hakim Bouamar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yidong Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siyuan Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco G.

When compared to Non-Latino Whites, Latinos are ~2-fold more likely to be diagnosed with and to die of GC. The goal of our research program is to contribute to GC research in patients of Latino ancestry and advance cancer health disparity research. One of the research projects aims at identifying germline variants associated with GC risk. To do so, we are identifying novel gastric cancer genes and detecting mutations in previously reported GC genes, using whole-exome sequencing, in 500 patients who have been diagnosed with early-onset GC and\/or who had GC and family history of cancer. Whole exome sequence data collection was recently completed and is being analyzed with the primary goals of estimating the prevalence and penetrance in known cancer genes as well as the identification of new GC genes. Using in-house exome data and publicly available genetic data, we will identify variants with predicted impact in the phenotype to design a panel that will be used for their detection in gastric preneoplasia biopsies. These variants will be tested using duplex sequencing, a highly sensitive method that can detect very rare mutations with ultra-depth sequencing. We will then select the variants with likely functional consequences for tumor initiation and\/or progression to generate isogenic gastric organoids to investigate their effect in proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression. We aim to generate a body of work that can be used for risk assessment, prevention, early diagnostic, and that will lead to better outcomes for GC in this important U.S. minority.

Cancers have been shown to have aberrant transcriptional regulation. Therefore, identifying transcription factor landscapes will aid in characterizing complex diseases. As an example, breast cancer has many subtypes that are phenotypically and molecularly distinct. Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is rare, and the most aggressive form of breast cancer currently known. It is a poorly characterized subtype, and diagnosis often results in poor prognosis for patients. As such, we decided to explore the transcription factor landscape in IBC. This was accomplished employing the following strategy: 1) We assembled de novo transcriptomes for SUM149, an IBC cancer line and MCF7, a non-IBC cancer line using Trinity; 2) We translated the assembled transcriptomes using getORF from EMBOSS; 3) We identified putative transcription factors in the translated transcriptomes using CREPE. We then identified differentially expressed genes between SUM-149 and MCF-7 using DEseq2. Our results highlight differences in the transcription factor catalogues between IBC and non-IBC cancers. Of interest in SUM-149 is the gene BNC1, a member of the C2H2 zinc finger family of transcription factors. Dysregulation of this gene is associated with brain metastasis in breast cancers which is a common phenotype in IBC. BNC1-associated genes are linked to GO terms such as, epithelial cell differentiation, and regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, via spliceosome; however, BNC1 functions in IBC are yet to be determined.

In India, it is the leading cause of cancer death and accounts for 13.5% of the total incidence of new cancer cases with a mortality rate of 10.6% irrespective of age and sex in 2020. The growing incidence marks the importance of profiling driver genes that are usually involved in proliferation, cell survival, oxidative stress response, progenitor phenotype, cell growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. In order to evaluate the mutation profile within breast tumor, we carried out Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) followed by gene analysis which is implicated in oncogenic pathways.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Experimental procedures: <\/b>40 primary breast cancer patients were recruited from the clinical follow-up at AIIMS, New Delhi, India. With informed consent, tumor and blood were collected after surgery followed by genomic DNA extraction. Library preparation was done by adopting a protocol developed by Illumina. Exonic regions were captured by using Trueseq Exome kit which covers &#8805; 80% of whole-exome and sequencing was performed by utilizing Illumina platform as per the manufacturer&#8217;s instruction. Bioinformatics analyses were carried out through an in-house developed pipeline. We identified altered genes by comparing them with the matched control and further filtered them on the basis of their functional impact.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In our study, a recurrent mutation in RTK-RAS, Notch, PI3K, WNT, Hippo, Myc, cell cycle, p53, TGF-&#946;, NRF2 pathways were reported among 40 individuals. We found a total of 263 altered genes, out of these 186 genes were driver genes comprise 88 tumor suppressor genes and 98 oncogenes while the rest are passenger genes. In terms of SNP Class- &#62;58%- missense, &#60;4%-silent, &#60;38%-nonsense mutations. These SNPs have their phenotypic impact such as high, moderate, modifier, and low which accounts &#60;2.4%, 8-12%, &#62;75%, and &#60;10% respectively. Missense mutation has a greater fraction of C&#62;T transitions followed by C&#62;A transversion. Moreover, we also identified p53, PIK3CA, EIF4EBP1 and ALK as a top mutated genes. A hotspot mutation H1047R in PIK3CA and R56W, as well as R99S in EIF4EBP1, were account for subsequently 20%, 25%, and 15% samples along with hotspot region in MAML3.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Here we demonstrate exclusive molecular profiling of the oncogenic pathways of breast cancer in the Indian population. Apart from nonsynonymous substitution, we also revealed recurrent mutation within a specific position or region of gene involved in the RTK-RAS, Notch, and PIK3CA network. Overall this study will improve insight for commonly mutated genes with a primary objective of screening, diagnosis, prognosis along risk stratification. In addition, this could be used to identify specific targetable candidate mutation gene panels with an overall objective of personalized drug therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/37948796-b032-4039-a015-7919fa77e9f9\/@y03B8ZHu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Signaling pathways,Whole exome sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16444"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rahul Kumar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anurag Srivastava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Usha Agrawal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>S.V.S.

Since synthetic lethal therapies target tumor cells specifically, they have fewer off-target effects than oncogene targeted approaches. To identify new cancer drug targets, we focused on paralogs, ancestrally-duplicated genes that frequently retain redundant or overlapping functions.<br \/>To find synthetic lethal human paralogs, we developed <u>p<\/u>aired <u>g<\/u>uide RNAs for <u>P<\/u>aralog g<u>EN<\/u>etic interaction mapping (pgPEN), a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 single and double knockout approach targeting over 2,000 paralogs. We applied pgPEN to two cancer cell lines and found that 12% of human paralogs exhibit synthetic lethality in at least one context. To our knowledge, pgPEN represents the largest experimental assessment of human paralog synthetic lethality to date.<br \/>We next identified paralog pairs to prioritize for follow-up study. A key drawback to synthetic lethal therapies is that many genetic interactions are context-dependent. To identify likely penetrant interactions, we compared our data to other published paralog screens and computational predictions of paralog synthetic lethality. We found that over 75% (<i>n<\/i>=96) of pgPEN hits were predicted to be broadly synthetic lethal, and nearly 10% (<i>n<\/i>=10) of pairs were synthetic lethal in multiple paralog screens.<br \/>Finally, we prioritized paralogs targeted by existing small molecule therapies. Of the 122 synthetic lethal pairs identified by pgPEN, 16% (<i>n<\/i>=20) are currently druggable. We mined drug repurposing data from DepMap to find pairs where a paralog-targeting drug showed a stronger effect in cell lines with low target gene copy number or expression relative to cell lines with normal target gene copy number or expression. These drugs could selectively target cancer cells in cases where one or both paralogs is lost in tumors but retained in normal tissue. We also leveraged The Cancer Genome Atlas tumor sequencing data to find paralog pairs where one member is recurrently lost in cancer.<br \/>Taken together, these studies identify druggable, highly penetrant synthetic lethal paralog interactions. In combination with tumor sequencing data, we identify high-priority paralog drug targets that can be further tested and translated to the clinic. Paralog synthetic lethal therapies could provide a relatively low-toxicity therapeutic approach to improve the efficacy of cancer treatments and prevent the emergence of acquired resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2dd6d6a9-97f8-42c8-98d8-7b8aef5b68ab\/@y03B8ZHu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Synthetic lethality,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16445"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Phoebe C.

NGS is mostly blind to large SVs, lacking sensitivity with FPR up to 89% in SV detection. Long-read sequencing (LRS) can address larger variations by generating read lengths of tens of thousands of bases &#38; have helped identify thousands of genomic features pertinent to cancer previously missed by NGS. However, throughput &#38; coverage of whole genome LRS makes it infeasible to conduct large-scale genomic studies to detect rare alleles.<br \/>Cancer cells within the same sample can be heterogenous, with subpopulations exhibiting different genomic features, that are difficult to detect with just 30x whole genome sequencing. Targeted sequencing significantly improves accuracy &#38; coverage by offering depths necessary to detect these rare alleles in a heterogenous population of cells. Recently, we developed ACME, an Affinity-based Cas9-Mediated Enrichment approach that is an improvement on nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing (nCATS) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies with the inclusion of a background reduction step. We targeted 10 prominent cancer genes in MCF 10A &#38; SK-BR-3 breast cell lines with ACME &#38; observed an increase in enrichment &#38; coverage of all genes on the panel, with enrichment as high as 5000-fold for some genes. We achieved a ~ 75-fold enrichment &#38; 35-65x coverage of the <i>BRCA2<\/i> region, an important breast cancer gene that was a ~90 kb target on our panel. Across our panel, we found that ACME helps increase the number of single contiguous reads that span the entire target, which ultimately helps with better alignment &#38; SV detection. ACME detected all SVs within our target regions that had been previously inferred by PacBio &#38; ONT whole-genome LRS, but with higher depth. This allows for rare variant detection, making it an effective long-read targeting platform.<br \/>We are currently developing ACME + native barcoding, which gave us mean target coverage of 10-30x in initial testing, to enable sample multiplexing along with target multiplexing.

RUNX1 variants generally consist of truncating mutations throughout the gene, as well as SNVs, insertions, and deletions in the RUNT domain. In the germline setting, these mutations may lead to familial platelet disorders and have profound implications in donor selection for allogeneic stem cell transplant. Approximately half of mutations in RUNX1 are classified as variants of unknown clinical significance (VOUS), underscoring the unmet needs of this patient population.<br \/>Methods: Bone marrow, peripheral blood, or FFPE tissue samples from 10,118 patients with suspected myeloid disease were sequenced using a 303 gene myeloid NGS panel. A total of 1209 RUNX1-mutated patients formed the cohort for this study. While pair-matched samples were not available and germline status not established, these patients were likely to be in the 40-60% variant allele frequency (VAF) range. Statistics were performed using Fishers exact test.<br \/>Results: Among RUNX1-mutated patients, 277 (22.9%) had a RUNX1 variant at a subclonal VAF (&#60;20%), 505 (41.7%), 352 (29.1%), &#38; 75 (6.2%) had variants at VAFs of 20-39%, 40-60%, &#38; &#62;60%, respectively. While all truncating mutations were classified as pathogenic, 84.3% of non-truncating RUNT domain mutations were classified as VOUS. RUNT domain mutations included 272 non-truncating and 220 truncating mutations. There were 599 (49.5%) truncating mutations throughout the entire gene. Non-truncating RUNT domain-mutated patients most frequently harbored mutations in ASXL1 (31.6%), SRSF2 (31.3%), TET2 (29.4%), STAG2 (19.1%), RAS (18.3%), and BCOR\/BCORL1 (17.3%). The frequency of RUNT domain co-mutations in the ASXL1 (36.8% [35] vs. 10.4% [5]; p=0.0007) and RAS families (28.4% [26] vs. 10.4% [5]; p=0.03) were significantly higher in the 40-60% VAF group compared to subclonal populations, while BCOR\/BCORL1 mutations (10.5% [10] vs. 29.1% [14]; p=0.008) were significantly lower. These results were recapitulated in a cohort of VOUS-only RUNT domain patients with a VAF of 40-60% compared to subclonal populations: ASXL1 (36.8% [21] vs. 22.2% [10]), RAS family (24.5% [14] vs. 10.9% [5]) , and BCOR\/BCORL1 (8.8% [5] vs. 31.1% [14]; p=0.005). Among patients with truncating mutations in RUNX1, mutations in ASXL1 (34.4% [44] vs 20.3% [42]; p=0.0047) and RAS family members (25.8% [33] vs. 10.1% [21]; p=0.0002) were more frequent in patients with VAFs of 40-60% when compared to subclonal populations, and mutations in BCOR\/BCORL1 were similar (28.1% [36] vs. 20.7% [42]).<br \/>Conclusions: The majority of RUNX1 mutations clustered in the RUNT domain are VOUS. This study demonstrates that both truncations and RUNT domain mutations harbor molecular signatures that reflect similar oncogenic mechanisms. These molecular signatures are also present when filtering exclusively by VOUS in the RUNT domain.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8cc88f70-66ac-46c8-bf94-71f655731ddf\/@y03B8ZHu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RUNX1,Acute myeloid leukemia,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16448"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Frank J.

The typical requirements in NGS workflow (nucleic acid fragmentation, library preparation, sequencing, etc) comprise scalability, efficiency, reliability, and robustness. Failures to achieve confidence in any of the steps can negatively impact sequence data, rendering them unusable for diagnosis. Covaris&#8217; Adaptive Focused Acoustics&#174; (AFA&#174;) technology enables efficient DNA fragmentation regardless of DNA concentration and starting molecular weight, ensuring a tight fragment size distribution, minimal sample loss, and most importantly, desired reliability and reproducibility.Illumina&#174;&#8217;s TruSight&#8482; Oncology 500 (TSO 500) protocol describes an enrichment-based approach to convert DNA and RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples into libraries enriched for cancer-related genes that can be sequenced on Illumina&#174; sequencing systems. The TSO 500 assay is optimized to prepare libraries from genomic DNA (gDNA) that is sheared to optimized fragment sizes and offers high fidelity determination of DNA variants across 523 cancer relevant genes. The TSO 500 assay is the assay of choice across most cancer centers using a standardized pipeline and therefore is suitable for routine use in precision oncology as a comprehensive genomic profiling solution. This study focuses on demonstrating the optimized DNA fragmentation protocol for TSO 500 assay with parallel 8-sample processing with an ML230 Focused-ultrasonicator.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/460202e1-24c4-491b-9d6b-6656769a7110\/@y03B8ZHu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Cancer cell,Genomics,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16449"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Debadeep Bhattacharyya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kasturi Pal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eugenio Daviso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrich Thomann<\/i><\/presenter>.

Notably, research has shown that a first-in-class, small molecule-specific OPA1 inhibitor can be used pharmacologically to curtail tumor growth; however, the OPA1 inhibitor did not explore how the interacting partner, <i>SLC25A46<\/i>, was affected by such inhibition. Indeed, novel targets are needed for advanced breast cancers as a means of therapeutic interventions. Considering the critical role of <i>SLC25A46<\/i>, we sought to investigate novel mitochondrial proteins that are understudied in breast cancer. We applied a statistical framework to calculate predicted gene expression for <i>SLC25A46<\/i> in 70,349 patients of European descent in BioVU, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) biorepository linked to de-identified electronic health records (EHRs). A genetically predicted gene expression model for <i>SLC25A46 <\/i>was trained on directly measured RNA-seq data across 17 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. We then fitted a multivariable logistic regression model to test <i>SLC25A46 <\/i>predicted expression<i> <\/i>against 1,704 phenotypes for each tissue. We observed that patients with high predicted expression of <i>SLC25A46<\/i> were more likely to receive diagnosis of &#8216;abnormal findings in mammograms&#8217; (P=2.76E-06, OR=2.26) in adipose subcutaneous tissues. Likewise, we found yet another significant association with &#8216;lump or mass in breast&#8217; (P=8.9E-06, OR=2.61) in adipose subcutaneous tissues. These results pass their individual Bonferroni correction that was applied separately for each tissue, but fell short of passing a strict multiple testing threshold that accounted for all tissues. Given the association between <i>SLC25A46<\/i> and abnormal phenotypes that are commonly coded for patients in relation to breast cancer, we conducted a linear regression model with <i>SLC25A46<\/i> and ionized calcium and found a modest association (P=0.03, OR=1.02). Elevated serum levels of calcium are frequently observed in advanced breast cancer. Additionally, proteins that interact with <i>SLC25A46<\/i> such as <i>OPA1<\/i>, are overexpressed in breast cancer. We further constructed a polygene score to determine the effects of these genes in all breast cancer phenotypes. Together, these data suggest that <i>SLC25A46<\/i> has implications in breast cancer as a novel target in cancer development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a4523f48-77cf-4b10-a860-a8f668a103e4\/@z03B8ZHv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Gene expression,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16450"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Heather K.

Molecular and genomic alterations, immune signatures and gene mutations contribute to the progression of CRC. The consensus molecular subtype (CMS), an RNA-based classification system with four classes, is used to better understand CRC heterogeneity. CMS1 is the immunogenic subtype, enriched with MSI; CMS2-CMS3 has epithelial characteristics; and CMS4 is characterized by mesenchymal transitions associated gene expression. CMS1 tumors display immune infiltration, hypermethylation and microsatellite instability, and are known to have a poorer prognosis. We investigated gene signatures and associated coding mRNAs, which are co-expressed by CMS1 CRC. We acquired CRC primary tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CXCL13, CXCR5, IL10, PIK3R5, PIK3AP1, CCL19 and other co-expressed genes were identified to be positively correlated with CMS1. The canonical pathways and their upstream regulators of this co-expressed network were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO). The co-expressed network associated with CMS1 was significantly and positively correlated with PI3K, WNT, ERK1 and ERK2 activation. This network was also positively correlated to right-sided tumors, microsatellite instability, chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, and immune responses. Our findings have confirmed and identified new gene signatures significantly correlated with CMS1, which in no doubt activate key pathways associated with CRC progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7adeb98-e43e-4929-81eb-0d622f1bd568\/@z03B8ZHv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,Bioinformatics,Cell signaling,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16453"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sha'Kayla K.

These events are used for both disease classification and as prognostic and predictive biomarkers. However, the rearrangement architecture and mutational processes giving rise to many of these events remain poorly characterized. Recent data indicate that sarcomas show particularly high frequencies of complex structural rearrangements, including patterns which do not fit those of known mutational mechanisms. As the largest whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset of sarcomas to date, the Genomics England (GE) 100,000 Genomes Project represents a unique cohort in which to examine these events.<br \/>Structural variants (SVs) were identified using five SV callers (Manta, Delly, LUMPY, SvABA and GRIDSS) in WGS data from 1330 GE samples. SVs were filtered to retain only those passing the quality filter, and to remove variants present in either matched germline samples or &#62;1% of a panel of normal variants. Caller performance was evaluated by comparison of distances between SV and copy number call breakpoints generated by Battenberg. SVs identified by at least two callers were taken forward as high-quality calls. Chromothriptic events, extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) and breakage-fusion-bridges were identified using established algorithms.<br \/>In keeping with previous data, the prevalence of structural variants varies by tumor type, with particularly high numbers of SVs observed in liposarcoma and osteosarcoma. Many tumor types included notable outlier samples; these were more likely to show evidence of chromothripsis, as identified by a dedicated chromothripsis caller. Liposarcomas show the highest frequency of chromothripsis, as described previously. In addition, we have examined some tumor types at higher granularity than previously available, demonstrating directly that the prevalence of chromothripsis varies by histological subtype. For example, chromothriptic events are identified in 100% of well-differentiated liposarcomas, but less than 10% of myxoid liposarcomas. Similarly, the presence of ecDNA varies by tumor type, with the novel observation of particularly high rates in angiosarcoma.<br \/>Despite recent advances in histological classification, the survival for patients with sarcoma has remained largely static for over 40 years. Determination of the mutational processes generating these rearrangements will shed light on the pathogenesis of these tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb5ee7d9-7df6-42ff-8832-b1d2d4135b1e\/@z03B8ZHv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Structural variants,Whole genome sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16455"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara Waise<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Lesluyes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Demeulemeester<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxime Tarabichi<\/i><\/presenter>, Sarcoma Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership, <presenter><i>Nischalan Pillay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrienne M.

DNA fragmentation is still a critical bottleneck during library preparation. Sonication methods have been the gold standard for consistent fragmentation and uniform GC coverage, but are associated with a high upfront investment, expensive consumables, and are prone to oxidative DNA damage. On the other hand, enzymatic fragmentation methods hold the potential to be scalable, automation-friendly workflows that minimize DNA damage. Yet, typical enzymatic fragmentation methods have been shown to introduce systematic hairpin artifacts, exhibit suboptimal uniformity, and have a narrow range of input mass compatibility. We have developed a novel enzymatic fragmentation-based library preparation technology which, together with our high-fidelity library amplification module, effectively overcomes many of the key limitations of related chemistries. Libraries generated using our workflow reduced chimeric reads and terminal hairpin artifacts 10-fold compared to other enzymatic methods, and reached comparable levels of mechanically sheared DNA controls. Furthermore, we observed consistently even coverage uniformity and low sequence-specific bias for human whole genome sequencing. Fragmentation was tested across a broad sample input range from 100 pg to 500 ng. Library insert sizes were highly tunable from 150 bp to 550 bp and consistent across the input titration. High quality libraries with minimal adapter dimer were prepared from as little as 1 picogram of gDNA by adjusting the post amplification clean up conditions. Taken together, this enzymatic fragmentation and library preparation workflow avoids library preparation artifacts that convolute variant calling, is highly scalable, and suitable for ultra-low input samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4272f427-c153-4ca3-8169-a5a52ba08ab3\/@z03B8ZHv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Genomics,Sequencing,DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16457"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zane Jaafar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josh Haimes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Harrison<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsay Peterkin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Ranik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Scott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian A.

They are classified in well differentiated G1, G2 and G3 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) which are all G3. Some studies have assessed the NET molecular landscape of certain primary sites, but no cross-sites molecular assessment has been performed to date. Thus, we aimed to perform a comprehensive transcriptomic and methylomic characterization of large series of NENs of different anatomical origins in order to identify molecular subgroups, unravel genes and\/or pathways involved, and explore their potential clinical relevance.<br \/>Transcriptomic and methylation data were obtained from tumor samples of 181 and 99 patients with NENs (37.02%G1; 54.7%G2 and 8.29%G3) using Clariom S Human microarrays and EPIC methylation arrays, respectively. Most common primary tumor site was the lung (43.1%), followed by the small intestine (35.4%), large intestine (8.8%), stomach (4.4%), pancreas (1.7%), other localizations (3.9%), and unknown primary (2.8%). Tumors were clustered using transcriptomic and methylation data by NMF and hierarchical clustering algorithms respectively, and differential expression (limma analysis) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to transcriptomic data clusters<br \/>NENs were classified into three different clusters. Two of them (C1 and C3) showed an inverse transcriptomic profile, while C2 presented a mixed profile. We identified that C3 had the highest expression levels of neuroendocrine-related genes (somatostatin receptor SSTR5 LFC: 0.77 ; FDR: 1.52x10e-25 ; serotonin receptor HTR1A LFC: 0.79 ; FDR: 1.20X10e-20 ; VIP LFC: 0.64 ; FDR= 1.41x10e-10 etc), in lung primary tumor samples (50%) and methylation cluster 1 (82.14%). On the other hand, C1 was enriched in some important cancer-related pathways ( MYC targets NES -6.37 FDR &#60; 10-3; MTORC1 NES -3.78 FDR &#60; 10-3) and oxidative phosphorylation (NES -4.87 FDR &#60; 10-3) ; and showed a higher proportion of small intestine primary tumors (46.34%), Grade 2 tumors (73.17%) and methylation cluster 2 (75%).<br \/>NENs of different primary sites can be stratified into two major transcriptomic clusters, with a third cluster having a mixed expression profile. The groups with extreme transcriptomic signatures were enriched in neuroendocrine-related genes or principal cancer pathways .These results suggest a dedifferentiation from a more indolent neuroendocrine phenotype to more aggressive proliferative tumor types that could be driven partially with the methylation profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e378523-94d4-4374-85f8-597cdc50de17\/@z03B8ZHv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Multiomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16458"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carlos Carretero Puche<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Soldevilla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Gil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna La Salvia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Lens-Pardo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paula Espinosa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Anton-Pascual<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gonzalo Gómez-López<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fátima Al-Shahrour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rocío García-Carbonero<\/i><\/presenter>.

As such, there is a growing need for rapid inline assessment of somatic variants in genes of key interest in oncology. The Oncomine&#8482; Precision Assay on the Ion Torrent Genexus Sequencer (OPAGX) is an amplicon-based automated next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that enables quick turnaround genomic profiling of biomarkers across 50 genes from solid tissue. The complete workflow, including library prep, templating, sequencing, and final report generation, can be completed in less than 30 hours for up to 32 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. This assay uses AmpliSeq&#8482; HD technology which includes unique molecular tags for sequencing error correction and increased sensitivity for low frequency variant detection. The assay&#8217;s detection of hotspot mutations (substitutions, insertions, deletions, copy number variants (CNVs), and fusions) was evaluated for FFPE tissue.<br \/>Method: Fully automated library preparation and sequencing was completed in the Genexus&#8482; Integrated Sequencer using 10 ng of DNA derived from FFPE tissue or from characterized control samples. Following gene specific amplification, AmpliSeq&#8482; HD technology is used to label amplicons with dual molecular barcodes. The resultant libraries are bead normalized, pooled, and sequenced on a GX5&#8482; chip to a targeted depth of 3,000,000 reads per sample. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were examined by evaluating the correctness of calling true positive variants compared to false negative and false positive variant calls, respectively. Precision and limit of detection (LoD) were examined by evaluating the concordance of variants across replicate control samples. Specificity and accuracy were examined by evaluating the correctness of calling true negative variants compared to false positive and all other variant calls, respectively.<br \/>Results: Accuracy and specificity were 99.9% for SNVs and 100% for insertions and deletions above 1% allele frequency (AF). Sensitivity and intra-run precision were 100% for SNVs and insertions and deletions above 1% and 2% AF, respectively. Inter-run precision and PPV were 100% for SNVs and insertions and deletions above 1% AF. The estimated AF LoD was 3.7% for SNVs. CNV gain calls were 100% for MET and EGFR and loss calls were 100% for PTEN (homozygous and heterozygous) and CDKN2A. Additionally, fusion calling for RET and ROS1 were 100%.<br \/>Conclusions: OPAGX is a quick turnaround NGS assay enabling precision medicine through automated multi-variant genomic profiling to inform decision making; performance was characterized with analysis of hotspot mutations in FFPE samples in a variety of tumor types, demonstrating utility of implementation in testing of targeted biomarkers across multiple indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8726ff7f-699c-48c7-90ac-72b2f58a5f68\/@z03B8ZHv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Genomics,Molecular diagnosis,Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16459"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Desiree Unselt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Frady<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Pufky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Fernando Torres<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Sims<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Mason<\/i><\/presenter>.

Non-coding RNAs are emerging field and play vital role in development of disease. Major non-coding RNAs are miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs and sn\/snoRNAs. We analyzed restricted and publically available RNA-seq and small RNA-seq data sets for biomarkers identification and their involvement in myeloma. We obtained restricted data from &#8220;BluePrint&#8221;, which contains 11 myeloma plasma cells and 4 normal tonsil plasma cells (EGAS00001001110). We identified 1534 genes are differentially regulated (2-fold cut-off, &#62;10-FC 218 genes). Top 10 upregulated genes were: EDNRB (1246-FC), SCUBE1 (737-FC), MC4R (691-FC), NDNF (601-FC), PTGS2 (567-FC), GPRC5D (531-FC), MFAP3L (467-FC), CCND1 (381-FC), CXCL12 (344-FC) and BTBD3 (326-FC) ; top 10 downregulated were: EBF1 (-111-FC), HLA-DRB1(-133-FC), CPXM1 (-171-FC), LOC642131 (-171-FC), IGHV1OR15-3 (-171-FC), HLA-DRB5 (-204-FC), PRAMENP (-210-FC), DTX1 (-220-FC), CD22 (-337-FC) and RFTN1 (-356-FC). Publically available small RNA-seq data downloaded and analyzed for miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs and sn\/snoRNAs which contains 3 healthy donor&#8217;s plasma cells and 3 newly diagnosed myeloma patient plasma cells (PRJNA377345). We used mirDIP portal to analyze miRNA and mRNA differentially expressed data, predicated from more than 13 databases showed major role of miR-152-3p (targets 28 mRNAs), miR-93-5p (targets 19 mRNAs), miR-301a-3p (targets 13 mRNAs), miR-29c-3p (targets 12 mRNAs), , and miR-144-3p (targets 9 mRNAs).

Some advantages provided by NGS-based techniques include a lower limit-of-detection and simpler paths to standardization compared to other methods. Importantly, in research of post-germinal B cell disorders, such as multiple myeloma (MM), NGS methods allow for the study of clonal lineage based on somatic hypermuation patterns. Current targeted NGS assays require multiple libraries to survey each B cell receptor chain (IGH, IgK, IgL), and this fact is highlighted when initial clonality detection fails due to mutations under primer binding sites.<br \/>Methods: A B cell pan-clonality panel (Oncomine&#8482; BCR Pan-Clonality Assay) targets the framework 3 (FR3) portion of the variable gene and the joining gene region of heavy- and light-chain loci (IGH, IgK, IgL) for all alleles found within the IMGT database, enabling readout of the complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequence of each immunoglobulin chain. Primers are included to amplify rearrangements involving Kappa deletion element. Reproducibility studies and clonality assessment were conducted using gDNA from a total of 45 MM research samples. All MM cases examined in this work were confirmed clonal via flow cytometry or IHC\/ISH in tissue sections. Sequencing and repertoire analyses were performed using the Ion GeneStudio S5 System and Ion Reporter 5.16 analysis software.<br \/>Results: Clonality assessment of MM research samples show an 93% overall positive detection rate by an assay which combines the IGH, IgK, and IgL chains using published guidelines for clonality assignment. Thirty-four of 45 samples show positive detection of an IGH rearrangement, while 41 of 45 showed positive detection of at least one light chain receptor. Clonality results for this sample set are well correlated with orthogonal data from flow, IHC\/ISH, or alternate NGS assays. A clonal lambda light chain was identified in 14 of 16 samples determined to be lambda restricted by flow cytometry. Estimates of somatic hypermutation rates were calculated using the BCR pan-clonality assay. Most MM samples contained somatic hypermutation with 6 of 45 samples showing mutation rates greater than 10%. Lineage analysis, based on somatic hypermuation signatures within each sample, identified 8 of 45 MM samples which contained 5 or more clones in the primary clonal lineage, with one case containing a lineage with 23 clones.<br \/>Conclusions: These results demonstrate the utility of a novel assay for combined repertoire analysis of B cell receptor heavy and light chains in a single library preparation reaction. We expect this assay to simplify workflow and inclusion of analysis tools such as automated somatic hypermutation rate determination and clonal lineage identification to open new paths for research in B cell disorders.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c37aea73-1727-429c-9671-eba72cebeebc\/@z03B8ZHv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Leukemias,B cells,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16463"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Geoffrey Marc Lowman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Landon Pastushok<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen Mochoruk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wayne Hill<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Toro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loni Pickle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolina Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Ostresh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shrutii Sarda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chenchen Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie Stakiw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Bosch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hadi Goubran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ron Geyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John DeCoteau<\/i><\/presenter>.

By comparing the predominantly caucasian TCGA GBM dataset (EUR, n=383) with a large genomic and transcriptomic East Asian GBM dataset (EAS, n=443), we identified numerous significant differences between EAS-GBM and EUR-GBM. Transcriptomic clustering also established a novel EAS-GBM molecular classification system and the discovery of a new EAS-specific GBM subtype. We characterized each subtype comprehensively including genomic alterations, immune profile and TCR\/BCR repertoire analysis. This study elucidates important ancestry-dependent biological and molecular differences between GBMs and proposes a new transcriptome-based EAS-GBM classification. Understanding these unique features contribute to a more comprehensive characterization of the heterogeneity in GBM patients and could facilitate more careful patient stratification during targeted therapy and drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Genomics,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16464"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Davy Deng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
