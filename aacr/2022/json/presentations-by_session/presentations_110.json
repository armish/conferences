How a subset of TSCs, or therapy resistant TSC (TrTSC), survives and supports tumor regrowth post treatment is a fundamental biological question and clinically unsolved problem. Recently, we utilized single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify therapy resistant TSCs (or TrTSCs) in mouse models of CRT-challenged intestinal adenoma, followed by bioinformatics analysis to reveal the bidirectional crosstalk that occurs between TSCs and the tumor microenvironment (TME). The results of the analysis indicate that TSCs shape the TME into an immunosuppressive barrier. Particularly, TrTSCs recruit tumor-associated monocytes and macrophages (TAMMs), which in turn, via Cox-2 dependent prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-PTGER4(EP4) signaling, induce Akt-mediated phosphorylation of &#946;-catenin and thus enhance the &#946;-catenin activity.&nbsp; Furthermore, we show that enhanced &#946;-catenin signaling upregulates multiple immune-checkpoint genes, thus empowering the immune escape capabilities of TSCs. Taken together, overcoming both the extrinsic immunosuppressive barrier and intrinsic immune escape has the potential to increase the efficacy of checkpoint inhibition therapies against cancers in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,Tumor microenvironment,Immunosuppression,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Linheng Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
