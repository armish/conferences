Importantly, the genes encoding subunits of the mammalian SWI\/SNF (mSWI\/SNF or BAF) family of chromatin remodeling complexes are mutated in over 20% of human cancers, including in several rare cancers in which such mutations play causative roles. This presentation will highlight recent biochemical and structural advances that have enabled the mechanistic understanding of mSWI\/SNF complex activities as well as functional assignment of disease-associated mSWI\/SNF complex perturbations, opening new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in cancer and beyond.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cigall Kadoch<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, two major challenges remain. One challenge is that a large percentage of cancer patients do not respond to ICB therapy in part due to tumors being poorly immunogenic, which limits the benefits of ICB. The other challenge is that even immunogenic tumors may lack a sustainable response to ICB due to multiple reasons including T cell exhaustion. We have been interested in understanding both of these issues. In this presentation, I will discuss our recent investigations of epigenetic regulation of T cell reinvigoration, which impacts ICB therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yang Shi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
