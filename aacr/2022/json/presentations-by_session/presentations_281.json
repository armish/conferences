Therefore, the restoration of differentiation is considered an anti-cancer therapy. SKP2 is an oncogenic E3-ubiquitin ligase that promotes cell proliferation by targeting the CDKi p21<sup>Cip1<\/sup> and p27<sup>Kip1<\/sup>. Previous works showed that SKP2 overexpression is induced by the fusion oncoprotein PAX3-FOXO1 expressed in fusion positive (FP)-RMS cells, and promotes tumor cell proliferation through p27<sup>kip1<\/sup> degradation. However, the role of SKP2 in fusion negative (FN)-RMS cells, devoid of any fusion gene, remains unclear. We report here that SKP2 transcript and protein levels are up-regulated in RMS patients and cell lines compared to normal tissue. Accordingly, we observed increased acetylation of H3K27 histone mark in RMS patients and cell lines compared to myoblasts and muscle tissue. We then show that in RMS cell lines <i>SKP2<\/i> expression is induced by MYOD, which binds two <i>SKP2<\/i> regulatory regions, an intronic and a distal enhancers, identified by Hi-C and 3C experiments. SKP2 knockdown in FN-RMS cells leads to p21<sup>Cip1<\/sup> and p27<sup>Kip1<\/sup> protein levels up-regulation coupled with G1\/S cell cycle arrest. Rescue experiments showed that SKP2 promotes cell proliferation directly targeting p27<sup>Kip1<\/sup>. Moreover, SKP2 binds and promotes degradation of p57<sup>Kip2<\/sup> and its silencing restores myogenic differentiation associated to MYOG and <i>de novo<\/i> MyHC expression in FN-RMS cells. SKP2 depletion also induces cell senescence and prevents anchorage-independent growth and stemness <i>in vitro<\/i>, and tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. In turn, SKP2 forced expression partially rescued the anti-cancer effects preventing the increase of p21<sup>Cip1<\/sup>, p27<sup>Kip1<\/sup>, p57<sup>Kip2<\/sup> and MYOG, promoting re-entry into cell cycle, inhibiting human myoblasts cell differentiation and restoring the tumorigenic potential in FN-RMS. Since neddylation is an essential step for the activity of SKP2, we used MLN4924, an inhibitor of the <u>N<\/u>edd8 <u>A<\/u>ctivating <u>E<\/u>nzyme (NAE), under clinical investigation, to resume SKP2 knockdown features. MLN4924 induces p21<sup>Cip1<\/sup> and p27<sup>Kip2<\/sup> expression, promotes senescence and apoptosis, and hampers cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> both in FP- and FN-RMS. These results unveil an unprecedented role for SKP2 in governing both proliferation and myogenic differentiation in RMS, suggesting that targeting SKP2 functions through MLN4924 treatment might have clinical relevance in FP- and FN-RMS.

However, there are limited therapeutic options and few biomarkers to indicate which patients will develop aggressive disease. Our lab has identified Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) as a key regulator of thyroid cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis. FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is auto-phosphorylated at tyrosine 397 (Y397) in response to integrin or growth factor receptor signaling resulting in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. While FAK is predominantly localized at the plasma membrane, FAK has also been shown to accumulate in the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) to promote cell survival. We have found that FAK localizes to the nucleus in a subset of thyroid cancer patient tumors and that phosphorylated Y397 FAK (pY397 FAK) specifically accumulates in the nucleolus. The nucleolus plays a key role in cancer progression through the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and subsequent increase in ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, and tumor growth. It is unclear how pY397 FAK localizes to the nucleolus and what the function of pY397 FAK is in the nucleolus.<br \/><b>Hypothesis: <\/b>Nuclear FAK drives thyroid cancer growth and survival through the phosphorylation of nucleolar proteins involved in rRNA transcription.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> To address the functional role of FAK in the nucleus, we excluded FAK from the nucleus by mutating its NLS and found that it significantly decreased anchorage independent growth compared to wild type (WT) FAK in our thyroid cancer cells (BCPAP and 8505C). Importantly, non-phosphorylatable FAK mutant (Y397F) and kinase dead FAK mutant also decreased growth indicating that nuclear and pY397 FAK are required for anchorage independent growth. Furthermore, we found that forcing FAK into the nucleus with an SV40 NLS resulted in increased FAK nucleolar accumulation which was eliminated when FAK is forced into the nucleus with Y397F FAK. These data indicate that pY397 FAK is required for FAK nucleolar accumulation. To investigate the role of pY397 FAK in the nucleolus, we performed BioID to identify novel protein-protein interactions for WT FAK and Y397F FAK. We found that pY397 FAK interacts with a network of nucleolar proteins including NPM1, TOP1, and DDX46. Interestingly, the majority of these nucleolar proteins are involved in transcription of pre-rRNA which is essential for protein synthesis and growth. Of note, Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) is an endoribonuclease that regulates pre-rRNA synthesis through the cleavage of the 46S rRNA transcript. We confirmed that pY397 FAK specifically interacts with NPM1 by Proximity Ligation Assay.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>These data indicate that pY397 FAK interacts with a network of nucleolar proteins involved in rRNA transcription and that nuclear pY397 FAK drives growth and survival in thyroid cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nuclear translocation,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Ribosomal RNA transcription,Thyroid\/endocrine-related cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meghan Kellett<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vibha Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brittelle Kessler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharon Sams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Molishree Joshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca E.

However, a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanism(s) is hindering the clinical advancement of SHP2i therapy for cancer. Here we report that cancer cells that harbor KRAS Q61H mutation (found in about 5 % of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors) or HEK293 cells that over-express KRAS Q61H are resistant to SHP2i. Our biochemical studies supported by all atom molecular dynamic simulations show that the Q61H mutation impairs intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and impedes stimulation of the GTPase cycle by both SOS1 and RASA1, but has negligible impact on binding to BRAF-RBD. Similar to wild-type KRAS, the Q61H mutant can be phosphorylated by Src at Tyr-32 and Tyr-64, and both site scan be dephosphorylated by SHP2, although SHP2i does not reduce ERK phosphorylation in KRAS Q61H cells. In vitro, phosphorylation of KRAS Q61H increased intrinsic nucleotide exchange without affecting its insensitivity to SOS1 and RASA1. Phosphorylation of wild-type and SHP2i-sensitive mutants (e.g., G12V) confers resistance to SOS1\/RASA1 activities and impairs binding to BRAF-RBD, thus the constitutive resistance to upstream regulation and uncompromised ability of phosphorylated KRAS Q61H to activate MAPK signaling are distinct properties of this mutant. Decoupling of KRAS Q61H from upstream signaling and impaired intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis lead to a highly GTP-loaded pool that is insensitive to the suppressive effects of Src phosphorylation. While SHP2 plays multiple roles in stimulating RAS signaling, including promoting the GEF function of SOS1, reducing p120 GAP-mediated inactivation of KRAS, and reversing Src phosphorylation of KRAS, we revealed that none of these are required by KRAS Q61H. These insights provide a mechanistic understanding of oncogenic KRAS mutants that can guide clinical trials of SHP2 inhibitors for patients with pancreatic and other cancers bearing KRAS Q61H.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"GTPase,KRAS,Phosphorylation,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Teklab Gebregiworgis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshihito Kano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael&#8239; Ohh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher B.

These can occur through mutation of the p110alpha and p85alpha proteins of PI3Kalpha itself as well as through alterations to upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and phosphatases of PIP3, including PTEN. As a whole, PI3K signaling is one of the most frequently altered in cancer. These mutations lead to activation of the PI3K complex and to constitutive downstream signaling. This signaling allows cells to enter a pro-growth and pro-survival state which is beneficial to the cancer cells.<br \/>The structure of PI3K has been extensively studied by crystallography and NMR. Here, we present our work on the full-length complex of p110alpha with p85alpha using cryo-EM. When compared with the previous structural studies, cryo-EM shows a similar structure and major structural features are unchanged. However, our cryo-EM studies revealed several additional structural features of the PI3K complex.<br \/>Cryo-EM showed that SH3, BH and cSH2 domains of p85alpha can bind to p110alpha. When inhibited with Alpelisib, these domains form a stable cover of the active site of the kinase. These domains interact with the helical and kinase domains of p110alpha and the iSH2 domain of p85alpha. The position of these domains restricts access to the kinase active site and may contribute to the inhibition of PI3K activity by Alpelisib.<br \/>When the PI3K complex binds to phosphorylated RTKs, the nSH2 binds to phosphotyrosine and relieves inhibitory interactions with the helical domain of p110alpha. Using cryo-EM, we have studied this activation by incubating the full-length PI3K complex with synthetic phosphopeptides. 2D cryo-EM class averages showed a dramatic rearrangement of the PI3K complex. In addition to the expected displacement of the nSH2 domain, the ABD and iSH2 domains undergo structural changes.<br \/>Acknowledgments: This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under awards R35 CA197582 (PKV) and R50 CA243899 (JRH).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Regulation,Kinases,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jonathan R.

The mechanisms that drive PRL-3&#8217;s oncogenic functions are not well understood, in part due to a lack of research tools available to study this protein. The development of such tools has proven difficult, as the PRL family is ~80% homologous and the PRL catalytic binding pocket is shallow and hydrophobic. Currently available small molecules do not exhibit binding specificity for PRL-3 over PRL family members, and the only research antibody specific for PRL-3 can only recognize denatured protein. To address the lack of tools available to study PRL-3, we have developed alpaca-derived single domain antibodies, or nanobodies, targeting PRL-3. Nanobodies have emerged as a valuable research tool and show promise as cancer therapeutics as they are ~15kD and lack light chains, allowing them to reach cavities within active sites that conventional antibodies cannot normally reach. Nanobodies also maintain high specificity and affinity for their antigens. We identified seven unique nanobodies that bind to PRL-3 with no activity towards PRL-1 and PRL-2, making our nanobodies one of the first tools to selectively target PRL-3 in its native state. We used biolayer interferometry and found the nanobody binding affinity for PRL-3 to be within a K<sub>D<\/sub> of 30 - 300 nM, similar to that of antibodies currently on the market. We identified PRL-3:nanobody interactions with hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and showed binding outside the active site. These data were confirmed by analyzing the effects of nanobodies on PRL-3 phosphatase activity and substrate binding. Our anti-PRL-3 nanobodies specifically pulled down PRL-3 over PRL-1\/-2 in immunoprecipitation experiments. Finally, we used these nanobodies to analyze PRL-3 localization in fixed immunofluorescence experiments in human cancer cells. We found that a C-terminal tag on PRL-3, such as FLAG or GFP, enhanced PRL-3 localization to the membrane, compared to untagged protein, which may have confounded previous PRL-3 functional studies. We are currently utilizing these nanobodies in two ways to understand PRL-3&#8217;s role in cancer. First, we will use the nanobody to stabilize PRL-3 for X-ray crystallography to develop higher resolution structures that could contribute to substrate identification and drug design. Secondly, we will examine PRL-3 function and trafficking during various cancer processes, such as proliferation, invasion, and stress, to determine how PRL-3 localization contributes to cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody engineering,Phage display,Single chain antibodies,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caroline Noel Smith<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Kihn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary A.

Our group has developed mouse models of LUAD metastasis and found that LUAD metastasis is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-dependent. EMT causes cancer cells to switch their axis of polarity from apical-basal to front-rear, which orients organelles and actin&#173;based cytoskeletal structures in ways that facilitate purposeful cancer cell motility and metastasis. The EMT-activating transcription factor ZEB1 silences microRNAs that target key inhibitors of the polarity axis switch. These data support the general belief that EMT-dependent metastasis is a cell-autonomous process. However, our new findings here show that ZEB1 coordinates the components of secretory trafficking machinery, Rab6A and Rab8A, via silencing miR-148a that target these effectors, to drive polarized secretory trafficking toward the leading edge of LUAD cells, to enhance surface exposure of MMP14 so that triggers ECM degradation, accelerates focal adhesion turnover and promotes cancer cell migration. Moreover, the ZEB1-driven secretory trafficking increases the secretions of cytokines and immunomodulation factors, to generate an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and to promote LUAD metastasis. These findings advance a paradigm in which EMT drives LUAD metastasis through a cell non-autonomous mechanism. The novelty rests in our results that demonstrate a transcriptional governance of polarized vesicular transport, providing the potential to target ZEB1-driven secretory pathways for the purpose of blocking metastasis in LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Secretory trafficking,Rab GTPase,immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guan-Yu Xiao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaochao Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leticia Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiang Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mayra Vasquez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hai Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Russell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Don Gibbons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Kurie<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, CAFs have become targets for cancer therapies. However, a major hurdle to developing such therapies are the challenges of studying CAFs in culture - specifically it remains unclear which CAF functions and phenotypes are sustained during <i>in vitro<\/i> culture and the signaling pathways driving distinct CAF phenotypes.<br \/>We investigated whether CAF phenotypes and functions are sustained or changed during 2D CAF culture under in vitro systems, our analysis included early passage, late passage, and immortalized cultures, as well as CAFs in coculture with cancer cell lines. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that inflammatory-related gene expression programs were suppressed in late passage and immortalized CAFs compared with early passage equivalents. Direct co-culture with lung cancer cells can revert the inflammatory gene expressions in immortalized CAFs such that they partially resemble early passage CAFs. In contrast, indirect coculture with lung cancer cells - in which CAFs could not form cell-cell contacts with cancer cells - had a less significant effect on immortalized CAF inflammatory gene expression but could induce TGF&#946; regulated genes. Interestingly, inhibition of the TGF&#946; signaling pathway potentiated the inflammatory gene expression network induced by direct co-culture, suggesting that the signaling mediated by direct cellular interaction is antagonistic to the TGF&#946; signaling pathway.<br \/>These data further our understanding of cancer cell &#8211; CAF crosstalk and will help to develop <i>in vitro <\/i>assays that more closely maintain the state of CAFs observed in tissue.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yutaka Naito<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Hynds<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Novo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Probir Chakravarty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gavin Kelly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Swanton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazufumi Honda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik Sahai<\/i><\/presenter>, TRACERx Consortium.
