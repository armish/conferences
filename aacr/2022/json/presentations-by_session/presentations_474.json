[{"Abstract":"Over 248,000 men in the U.S. alone this year will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and over 33,300 will die from the disease. The World Health Organization, in the case of breast cancer, has classified night-shift work involving light at night (LAN)-induced circadian disruption to be a probable carcinogen (Class 2A). Exposure to LAN suppresses nighttime pineal melatonin (MLT) production that influences normal and neoplastic tissue metabolism, physiology, and proliferation. Previously, we showed in rodent and human tumors <i>in vivo <\/i>that MLT inhibits linoleic acid (LA)-uptake and conversion to 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), a lipoxygenase product that enhances epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-I-induced mitogenesis. Recently, we developed a tissue-isolated, castration-sensitive VCaP human prostate cancer xenograft model to test the hypothesis that suppression of the nocturnal MLT signal due to exposure to dim LAN (dLAN) accelerates tumor LA-uptake and metabolism, aerobic glycolysis (Warburg Effect), and proliferative activity. Male nude rats (Crl:NIH<i>Foxn1<sup>rnu<\/sup><\/i>; n=6\/group) bearing castration-sensitive VCaP human prostate cancer xenografts were maintained on either a control L(300 lux)D(0 lux),12:12 or experimental LD,12:12dLAN (300 lux light phase followed by dLAN 0.2 lux dark phase intensity) light\/dark cycle. Results revealed (Mean &#177; S.D.) plasma MLT levels in controls peaked in the mid-dark phase (183.4 &#177; 12.8 pg\/mL) and were lowest (2.2 &#177; 0.4 pg\/mL) in the mid-light phase, and low (&#60; 10 pg\/mL) throughout the 24-hr period in dLAN rats. Tumors in rats exposed to dLAN exhibited a significantly shorter latency to onset and a two-fold faster growth rate than controls. Harvested control group tumors revealed elevated cAMP levels, LA uptake, 13-HODE production, the Warburg effect, and [<sup>3<\/sup>H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, as well as elevated patterns of expression of signaling pathways phospho-ERK1\/2, -AKT, -STAT3, -glycogen synthase kinase-3&#946; (GSK3&#946;), and -NF-&#954;&#946;, and full-length androgen receptor and aldo-keto reductase (AKR1C3), during the light phase and markedly suppressed during the dark phase. In the dLAN group, these measures were markedly elevated throughout the 24-hr period. This is the first evidence <i>in vivo,<\/i> that dLAN-induced disruption of integrated circadian rhythms of signaling, metabolism, and proliferation results in accelerated growth of castration-sensitive human prostate cancer xenografts. Thus, lighting design strategies to minimize human exposure to LAN that preserve the integrity of the circadian MLT signal may offer a novel approach to suppress the growth progression of human castration-sensitive prostate cancer in our increasingly 24-hour society. &nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/976a5887-de32-40c1-a49a-4eb65ac68e97\/@s03B8ZNm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Warburg effect,Melatonin,Environmental exposure,Lipid metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/898"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erin M.

To address this gap, we investigated the effects of chronic waterpipe smoke (WPS) exposure on lung pathobiology, host immunity, and tumorigenesis using both an experimental animal model and an exploratory observational analysis of human waterpipe smokers and non-smokers. Mice exposed to increasing doses of WPS (once or five times per week for 20 weeks), through an exclusively devised exposure system for this study, were more prone to develop lung tumors compared to control-air exposed littermates. This effect was accompanied by various pro-tumor immune phenotypes, including increased IL-17A+ levels in T\/B cells as well as elevated expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#946; in myeloid cells. While flow cytometry analysis revealed increased CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration in WPS-exposed mice, gene signatures of cytotoxic and expanded immune response were, conversely, decreased in animals exposed to heavy WPS relative to control air. Interestingly, mice heavily exposed to WPS exhibited increased expression of Tmprss4, Cd55, and Ace2, cell receptors and mediators of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry and, thus, COVID-19 pathogenesis. We also perform RNA-sequencing analysis of bronchial airway epithelial brushings of cancer-free waterpipe smokers and non-smokers undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy. Transcriptomes of normal airway cells in waterpipe smokers, relative to waterpipe non-smokers, harbored gene programs that were associated with poor clinical outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients, alluding to a WPS-associated molecular injury, like that established in response to cigarette smoking. Overall, our analyses demonstrate immunomodulatory and carcinogenic effects of WPS on the murine and human lung. Our study also shows that WPS exposure leads to a <i>field of injury<\/i> that may be associated with increased risk for lung cancer. This study is unique for interrogating carcinogenic effects of chronic exposure to WPS with the longest, to our knowledge, follow-up time <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our findings accentuate the need for additional studies that can guide evidence-based policies to counteract shortfalls in public health control of waterpipe smoking.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/83ba8e38-59fb-467a-a9ca-054860c1f82d\/@s03B8ZNm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carcinogenesis,Waterpipe smoking,Lung adenocarcinoma,Non-cigarette tobacco,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/899"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zahraa Rahal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maya Hassane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nareg Karaoghlanian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiexin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ansam Sinjab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>J.

The US Department of Veterans Affairs has recently recognized that exposure to both Agent Blue and Agent Orange can potentially increase risk of bladder cancer (BCa) and has added BCa to the list of diseases for which Veterans can seek military benefits. Agent Blue contained significant quantities of organic arsenic and although arsenic is a recognized carcinogen, the understanding of how arsenic affects BCa is still unclear in the literature. Moreover, the effects of the Agent Orange contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on BCa remains largely unstudied, especially in populations that were exposed during this period. We hypothesized chronic exposure to carcinogens TCDD or organic arsenic in the form of cacodylic acid (CA) would enhance cancer associated phenotypes. We treated benign urothelial cells (UROtsa and SV-HUC-1 cells) with low doses of cacodylic acid (0.05-5&#181;M) or TCDD (0.03 - 3nM) for up to 6 months. While we found minor differences in proliferation rates there was no consistent trend across samples in either cell line nor was cellular migration affected. Because benign urothelial cells represent a transformed cell line and not true urothelial cells, we next wanted to assess how CA affected BCa formation in mice using the validated N-Butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) induced BCa model. TCDD was omitted from this step as its carcinogenicity in mice is understood to dramatically exceed human levels and thus is not relevant to human data. To approximate early-life exposure akin to what Vietnam Era Veterans may have experienced, we treated C57Bl\/6J mice with BBN for 16 weeks or 20 weeks with or without increasing concentrations of cacodylic acid (5, 10, 50ppm) for 4 weeks during BBN treatment, starting at week 4 and ending at week 8, and evaluated outcomes associated with BCa formation and progression. While previous reports have found CA promotes BBN induced BCa, we found co-treatment with CA had no effect at 16 weeks post BBN, but reduced both bladder weights (a surrogate for tumor volume) and tumor stage after 20 weeks. RNA-sequencing was used to determine how CA affected the transcriptome of BBN induced tumors. Differential gene expression and Reactome analysis indicated the predominant changes were associated with alterations in RNA processing and translation, EGFR signaling and more. Our work thus far indicates that the ability of TCDD\/CA exposure to promote BCa formation is likely context dependent. Future studies will enhance our understanding of how CA interacts with BBN acutely, and attempt to define mechanisms of how arsenic may protect against BBN induced BCa in experimental models, and whether this is clinically relevant for Vietnam Era Veterans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/75907242-994c-46f9-967a-9083b627c03d\/@s03B8ZNm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Carcinogenesis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/900"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ganeshkumar Rajendron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erika Abbott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffery Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shachi Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Barchowsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie Dennis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Benjamin L.

These electrophiles often form adducts with nucleophilic Cys34 of human serum albumin, which can be quantified to assess <i>in vivo <\/i>oxidative stress and other biological processes. Here, we aimed to examine the associations of Cys34 albumin adducts with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common adult myeloid leukemia, which has strong links with exposure to certain chemicals and ionizing radiation.<br \/>Methods: This nested case-control study included data from 52 incident AML cases and 103 controls matched on age, sex, and race from two prospective cohorts: the CLUE study (24 cases and 48 controls) and the PLCO Trial (28 cases and 55 controls) and 42 untargeted serum Cys34 albumin adducts measured by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for AML risk for each albumin adduct on a continuous scale and across tertiles of exposure in combined samples as well as stratified by the median years of follow-up.<br \/>Results: The median (range) follow-up from phlebotomy at enrollment was 5.47 (1.02 - 29.93) years. Several Cys34 albumin adducts were significantly associated with incident AML risk. For example, higher serum levels of S-&#947;-Glu-Cys adduct (894.44) were associated with lower risk of AML (OR<sub>continuous<\/sub>= 0.18; 95% CI: 0.37-0.92; <i>p<\/i>-value= 0.04). Similarly, the ORs for the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> and 3<sup>rd<\/sup> tertiles of adduct levels compared to the lowest tertile were 0.65 (95% CI: 0.31-1.36) and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.12-0.80), respectively (<i>p<\/i>-trend = 0.01). Stratification by median years of follow-up showed that the association was largely driven by effects present among cases diagnosed &#8805;5.47 years of follow-up; the OR<sub>continuous<\/sub> was 0.06 (95% CI: 0.01-0.61; <i>p<\/i>-value = 0.02) and ORs by tertile were 0.32 (95% CI: 0.09-1.16) and 0.22 (95% CI: 0.06-0.89) for the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> and 3<sup>rd<\/sup> tertiles, respectively compared to the lowest tertile (<i>p<\/i>-trend= 0.04). In contrast, there was no association for cases diagnosed within 5.47 years of follow-up (OR<sub>continuous<\/sub>= 0.78; 95% CI: 0.07-8.95; p-value= 0.84).<br \/>Conclusion: Higher serum levels of Cys34 adduct of S-&#947;-Glu-Cys, which is a substrate for the biosynthesis of L-glutathione, a key antioxidant in humans, were associated with a lower risk of AML. Modified Cys34 adducts of human serum albumin could potentially help to understand the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fc17652c-cddb-434d-96d1-6f943fb578a7\/@s03B8ZNm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Adducts,Carcinogenesis,Chemical carcinogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/901"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohammad L.

However, the background mutational landscape in normal gastric epithelium and the first genomic steps towards the formation of gastric cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of microdissected gastric glands (n=271) from 30 patients, 18 of whom had gastric cancer. We show that gastric glands are clonal structures and accrue approximately 27 single base substitutions per year. While the mutational signatures in most normal glands reflect age-related mutagenesis, gastric glands sampled close to a tumor showed exposure to a mutagenic process enriched in tumors (COSMIC reference mutational signature SBS17). Phylogenetic analysis shows that acquisition of SBS17 substitutions is closely linked to overt malignant transformation. We also observe widespread trisomies of specific chromosomes, which are recurrently and independently acquired in many gastric glands of the same patient. Mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers and chromatin remodelers showed evidence of positive selection and were highly enriched in some patients. This was confirmed by targeted sequencing of cancer genes in a further 1008 gastric glands. Strikingly, glands that exhibit driver mutations, a recurrent trisomy or elevated mutation loads only overlap minimally, suggesting a highly variable and patient-specific mutation and selection landscape in the normal gastric epithelium.

UVB exposure derived from sunlight is the major carcinogenic driver of skin cancer and poses a major public health risk. In response to UVB exposure, keratinocytes must activate DNA repair pathways to avoid mutagenesis. In addition to DNA repair pathways, cells initiate well-coordinated DNA damage response pathways to facilitate the repair process, including arresting global transcription. Here we report the use of kethoxal-assisted single-strand DNA-Sequencing (KAS-Seq) technology to profile the transcriptional dynamics that underlie the DNA damage response upon UVB exposure. Mechanistically, KAS-Seq involves the addition of an azide-tagged kethoxal group (N<sub>3<\/sub>-kethoxal) to DNA samples, which then reacts with guanines on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A &#8220;KAS signal&#8221; is therefore only obtained when DNA is unwound, allowing the N<sub>3<\/sub>-kethoxal reaction with accessible guanines to occur. Accordingly, in response to DNA damage, DNA can form ssDNA bubbles in order to facilitate DNA damage recognition and repair processes. KAS-Seq is therefore a suitable method to profile the transcriptional dynamics that occur in response to UVB-induced DNA damage. Here we show that UVB exposure in normal human keratinocytes (NHEK) cells induces a temporal and dynamic reprogramming in transcription using KAS-Seq. In terms of global transcription, our data show that the greatest loss of KAS signal occurs rapidly between 30mins and 3hrs post-UVB exposure, signifying transcriptional arrest. Interestingly, KAS signal is regained between 6-24hrs post-UVB, which is representative of a transition towards transcriptional recovery and induction of DNA damage processes. Furthermore, a more discrete and targeted analysis shows that the gain and loss of KAS signals primarily occur within the gene body, followed by promoter and intergenic regions. Overall, our data shows that transcriptional control in response to UVB-induced DNA damage is both dynamic and temporal. Further analysis is required to identify which transcriptional phenotype (transcriptional arrest or transcriptional recovery) is the most deleterious to the cell and DNA damage repair processes when disrupted. Additionally, we aim to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie these global changes in transcription, which will provide expanded insights into the wide-ranging oncogenic mechanisms that underlie UVB exposure.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a42aca49-3ce3-4652-8d74-817c146f582b\/@t03B8ZNn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Transcriptional regulation,Epigenetics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/905"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emma A.

However, recent studies suggests that all plastics including our daily usages for food\/drink containers may leach chemicals if they are scratched or heated or stored long term and strongly suggests that at certain exposure levels of BPA in these products, may cause cancers including breast, lung, and ovarian cancers in humans. Although there are few studies about breast, lung and ovarian cancers, with BPA exposure there is an urgent need to focus on the BPA&#8217;s carcinogenic activity in the lung. Because lung cancers can progress to life threatening events and short life span once it is diagnosed, identifying the mechanism that specifically inhibits\/prevents lung cancers invasion and related morbidity is of tremendous importance for reducing mortality. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the carcinogenicity of BPA using human bronchial epithelial cells.<br \/><b>Experimental methods:<\/b> To determine whether BPA alters canonical histone mRNA processing <i>in vitro<\/i>, we measured levels of polyadenylation (polyA) of canonical histone (H)3.1 mRNA as well as protein expression of Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), and H3 protein in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells exposed to various concentrations of BPA for 96 h. Furthermore, BEAS-2B cells were chronically exposed to low doses of BPA, the cell transformation assay was performed in an anchorage-independent growth and colony formation was assessed. Arsenic was used as a positive control because our laboratory previously demonstrated that arsenic-induced polyA of H3.1 mRNA, by depletion of SLBP <i>in vitro<\/i> and that polyA of H3.1 mRNA enhanced tumor formation in nude mice.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our results showed that exposure of BEAS-2B cells to BPA depleted SLBP, induced polyA of canonical histone mRNAs, and upregulated H3 protein. The results from real-time quantitative PCR showed that BPA exposure increased level of polyA H3.1 mRNA. Furthermore, our findings from an anchorage-independent growth assay also indicate that exposure of BEAS-2B cells to low doses of BPA induced malignant cell transformation.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The present study demonstrated that chronic exposure of the cells to BPA causes malignant cell transformation, indicating that BPA is a potent human carcinogen to induce lung cancer. Our study also demonstrated that the loss of SLBP and gain of polyA H3.1 mRNA play an important role in BPA-induced carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f4822b30-3955-4d60-b44f-2b2a1d7eae73\/@t03B8ZNn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Environmental exposure,Bisphenol A,Stem-loop binding protein,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/906"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arul Veerappan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhou Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Max Costa<\/i><\/presenter>.

Over 140 million people from 50+ countries are exposed to drinking water containing arsenic at levels above &#8220;safe&#8221; levels of 10 &#956;g\/L. Several studies indicate that chronic arsenic exposure is associated with the development of carcinogenic changes in the lungs, bladder, liver, and skin and other potential health problems. In this project, we aim to characterize bladder cancer mutational signatures and somatic mutations in a cohort of bladder cancer patients known to have been highly exposed to arsenic in northern Chile by using whole-exome sequencing (WES). We analyzed WES data and identified somatic mutations and mutational signatures using Mutec2 and SigProfiler. Preliminary analyses from a small number of exposed patients identified two mutational signatures, previously described as having &#8220;unknown&#8221; etiology, that showed an association with arsenic exposure. We are currently validating these findings in additional samples and with functional studies.

Exposure to Solar UVB (ultraviolet B) radiation is the primary etiologic factor for skin cancer. Sunscreens provide limited protection against UVB-induced skin cancer, and there is no effective adjuvant therapy for aggressive cSCC. Therefore, new mechanism-based approaches are needed for both prevention of cSCC and as adjuvant treatment for patients at high risk for recurrence and metastasis. Moreover, excision of cSCC of the Head &#38; Neck results in significant facial disfigurement, and thus, chemoprevention for patients with condemned skin is critical. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 17 (CXCL17) is the latest chemokine family member, and recent studies have identified both a causative and protective role of CXCL17 in tumorigenesis. The role of CXCL17 in the development and progression of cSCC is not yet elucidated. In our ongoing studies, CXCL17 protein expression was significantly overexpressed in cSCC cell lines (SCC12A, SCC118, SCC7, SCC59) compared to normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Deletion of CXCL17 significantly inhibited cSCC cell proliferation, migration, and motility, suggesting an essential role in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Tumor-specific overexpression of CXCL17 was detected in human cSCC that further bolsters our in vitro findings, indicating a causative role for CXCL17 in skin tumorigenesis. Further, deletion of CXCL17 in cSCC cell lines was associated with marked downregulation of the AKT\/mTOR\/STAT3 cell signaling pathways. To translate our in vivo data in an in vivo animal model, the effect of CXCL17 deletion on cSCC tumor cell xenograft growth was evaluated. Deletion of CXCL17 in both non-metastatic and metastatic cSCC cells significantly decreased tumor growth. Moreover, the reduction in tumor growth was associated with a significant downregulation in tumor angiogenesis measured using IHC for CD31. Finally, using a retrospective chart review for patients at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport (LSUHSC-S) and Overton Brooks Veterans Affairs Medical Center, we investigated the correlation of CXCL17 staining in human cSCC tumor samples and clinicopathological factors associated with metastatic cSCC. Among 44 subjects included in the analysis, the Histo-score of cytoplasmic CXCL17 expression was significantly higher in the metastatic cSCC group compared to non-metastatic tumor samples. Interestingly, the CXCL17 staining score correlated with the perineural invasion, suggesting CXCL17 as a biomarker of aggressiveness. Our studies have established a causative role for CXCL17 in cSCC and a novel target in the treatment of cSCC","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/caf2814d-98af-466b-a81c-e6f7e153f3e2\/@t03B8ZNn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carcinogenesis,Angiogenesis,Cell signaling,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/909"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alok R.
