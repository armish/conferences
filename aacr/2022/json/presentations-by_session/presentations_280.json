However, TOO cannot be determined for ~3% of metastatic cancer patients that present in the clinic and are categorized as cancers of unknown primary (CUP). As whole genome sequencing (WGS) of tumors is now transitioning from the research domain to diagnostic practice in order to address the increasing demand for biomarker detection, its use for detection of TOO in routine diagnostics also starts becoming within reach. While proof of concept for the use of genome-wide features has been demonstrated before, more complex WGS mutation features, including structural variant (SV) driver and passenger events, have never been integrated into TOO-classifiers even though they bear highly characteristic links with tumor TOO. Using a uniformly processed dataset containing 6820 whole-genome sequenced primary and metastatic tumors (ICGC\/PCAWG and Hartwig cohors), we have developed Cancer of Unknown Primary Location Resolver (CUPLR), a random forest based TOO classifier that employs 502 genome-wide features based on simple and complex somatic driver and passenger mutations. Our model is able to distinguish 33 cancer (sub)types with an overall accuracy of 91% and 89% based on cross-validation (n=6139) and hold out set (n=681) predictions ,respectively. We found that SV derived features increase the accuracy and utility of TOO classification for specific cancer types. To ensure that predictions are human-interpretable and suited for use in routine diagnostics, CUPLR reports the top contributing features and their values compared to cohort averages. The comprehensive output of CUPLR is complementary to existing histopathological procedures and may thus improve diagnostics for patients with CUP. CUP is the first reimbursed indication for WGS in The Netherlands. We will report on the prospective use and clinical utility of WGS for CUP patients in routine diagnostics but also highlight the added value of CUPLR for unsolved differential diagnosis cases and incidental cases where the independent WGS analysis was discrepant with the original tumor diagnosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole genome sequencing,Machine learning,Diagnosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Luan Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luuk Schipper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Roepman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim Monkhorst<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arne Van Hoeck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petur Snaebjornsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Edwin Cuppen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) Consortium has previously demonstrated that therapy-induced selective pressures shape the genetic evolution of glioma in a stochastic manner. However, single-cell studies have revealed that malignant glioma cells are highly plastic and transition their cell state in response to diverse challenges, including changes in the microenvironment and the administration of standard-of-care therapy. To interrogate the factors driving therapy resistance in diffuse glioma, we collected and analyzed RNA- and\/or DNA-sequencing data from temporally separated tumor pairs of over 300 adult patients with IDH-wild-type or IDH-mutant glioma. In a subset of these tumor pairs, we additionally performed multiplex immunofluorescence to capture the spatial relationship between tumor cells and their microenvironment. Recurrent tumors exhibited diverse changes that were attributable to changes in histological features, somatic alterations, and microenvironment interactions. IDH-wild-type tumors overall were more invasive at recurrence and exhibited increased expression of neuronal signaling programs that reflected a possible role for neuronal interactions in promoting glioma progression. In contrast, recurrent IDH-mutant tumors exhibited a significant increase in proliferative expression programs that correlated with discrete genetic changes. Hypermutation and acquired CDKN2A homozygous deletions associated with an increase in proliferating stem-like malignant cells at recurrence in both glioma subtypes, reflecting active tumor expansion. A transition to the mesenchymal phenotype was associated with the presence of a specific myeloid cell state defined by unique ligand-receptor interactions with malignant cells, providing opportunities to target this transition through therapy. Collectively, our results uncover recurrence-associated changes in genetics and the microenvironment that can be targeted to shape disease progression following initial diagnosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Microenvironment,Recurrence,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Frederick S.

The generation of these chromosomal alterations likely involves alterations in the structure and location of telomeres at chromosome ends, though these events have been difficult to assess due to the long and highly repetitive nature of telomeres. Here, we developed an analytic method (TeloFuse) to identify new telomeres and chromosomal arm fusions which are characterized by telomeric repeats at intra-chromosomal locations. We applied TeloFuse to identify telomere-containing fusions as well as novel sites of telomere addition using short-read genome sequencing data from 326 cancer cell lines followed by long-read genome sequencing and cytogenetic analysis of selected cell lines. We observed new telomeres at sites of terminal deletion in long read data (telomere length = 2-9 kb), and in 76\/326 (23%) of cell line genomes with short read data. Telomere sequence-containing fusions at intra-chromosomal sites were detected in 75\/326 (23%) of cancer cell lines and confirmed as chromosomal arm fusion events by long-read genome sequencing. Long-read genome sequencing further suggests that new telomeres have similar telomere length as telomeres found on normal chromosomal arms (median = 5kb). Conversely, telomeric repeats at sites of chromosomal arm fusions were found to be critically short (~200-500bp long). Extending our analysis to 97 lung adenocarcinoma patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we further found new telomeres in 17\/97 (18%) and chromosomal arm fusions in 28\/97 (29%) patients with short-read data. Notably, new telomeres and chromosomal arm fusion events were also found to disrupt protein-coding genes, suggesting that these events represent a poorly appreciated mode for gene inactivation in cancer. Our results suggest that the formation of new telomeres and chromosomal arm fusions are prevalent events during cancer genome evolution and are likely critical for the stabilization of new chromosomes in human cancers. More broadly, our findings also highlight the utility of long-read genome sequencing in delineating chromosomal-scale alterations that have been widely observed by cytogenetics analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Telomeres,Long-read sequencing,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kar-Tong Tan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael K.

Complex computational tools were developed to characterize coding driver mutations in 30+ cancer types. However, genomic and functional characterization of noncoding drivers outside coding regions (~98% of the genome) and a systematic understanding of how these events contribute to tumor development is still lacking. While driver mutations in coding regions directly change protein functions (e.g., tonic activation of a receptor), drivers in the noncoding genome can activate genes not expressed in normal tissue, thereby recruiting them for oncogenesis. This suggests that the biology of drivers in coding and noncoding regions differs substantially, and that specific tools will be needed for the accurate interpretation of noncoding mutations in whole-genome sequencing data. Here, we developed a new statistical test that accounts for the biology of noncoding regions, including epigenetic structure, fluctuations of mutation rates, and positional clustering, for the genome-wide analysis of somatic noncoding mutations in more than 3,500 whole cancer genomes across 19 human cancer types. On average, we identified ~5 novel noncoding events per cancer type, including many of the noncoding findings from previous studies (e.g., PCAWG consortium) along with novel observations. Many significant results fell into two categories: (i) highly localized mutagenic processes not observed in the rest of the genome and (ii) significantly mutated promoter and enhancer regions of genes associated with tumor signaling. We observed that findings associated with localized processes translated into distinct transcriptional states in bulk RNA-seq data and single-cell expression profiles. Moreover, they enabled the prediction of tumor cells-of-origin. Many significantly mutated regulatory regions exhibited differential expression of their associated target gene. We validated a subset of these findings, including noncoding mutations altering the activity of the estrogen pathway in breast cancer, by performing CRISPR-interference and luciferase reporter experiments in cancer cell lines. Mutated and non-mutated samples further harbored differential epigenomic profiles, suggesting noncoding mutations directly affected the regulatory activity of their target regions. Many significantly mutated regulatory regions involved known cancer genes, while others targeted genes that had been functionally linked to cancer before but were not considered canonical cancer genes. Broadly, our work reveals that interpreting whole cancer genomes involves challenges specific to noncoding regions. Our extensive catalog of testable hypotheses provides a blueprint for prospective experimental and computational follow-up studies that build on the concepts of our work.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Whole genome sequencing,Mutations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Felix Dietlein<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex B.

In order to obtain spatial information of clonal genetic events, prior studies have used methods such as laser capture microdissection, which results in assessment of small regions or even single cells. These studies have an inherent bias as a limited number of regions per tissue section can be retrieved and examined. Furthermore, because investigators have selected such regions based on morphology, previous studies have limited their analyses to histologically defined tumour areas while excluding regions populated by benign cells. The possibility to perform unsupervised genome and tissue-wide analysis would therefore provide an important contribution to delineate clonal events. We sought study spatial genome integrity in situ to gain molecular insight into clonal relationships.<br \/>Materials and Methods: We employed spatially resolved transcriptomics (Visium, 10x Genomics) to infer spatial copy number variations in &#62;120 000 spatial regions across multiple organs, including three whole axial prostates and additional tissues from skin, breast and brain tumors. We used this information to deduce clonal relationships between regions harboring 5-20 cells.<br \/>Results: We demonstrate that genome-wide copy number variation reveals distinct clonal patterns within tumours and in nearby benign tissue. We perform an in-depth spatial analysis of cancers that includes an unprecedented interrogation of up to 50,000 tissue domains in a single patient, and 120,000 tissue domains across 10 patients. In a prostate section, we observed that many CNVs occurred in histologically benign luminal epithelial cells, most notably in chromosomes 8 and 10. This clone constituted a region of exclusively benign acinar cells branching off a duct lined by largely copy neutral cells. The changes in these cells were shared with the nearby intermediate risk prostate cancer cells in the same tissue section. We observed similar findings in another patient&#8217;s cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), wherein benign squamous epithelial had alterations in chromosomes 1 and 12 that were shared with nearby cSCC. Our results suggest a model for how genomic instability arises in histo-pathologically benign tissue that may represent early events in cancer evolution. Furthermore the spatial information allowed us to identify small clonal units not evident from morphology and hence would be overlooked by pathologists.<br \/>Conclusions: We present the first large&#8208;scale, comprehensive atlas of genomic evolution at high spatial resolution in prostate cancer. Our study adds an important new approach to the armamentarium of cancer molecular pathology. We highlight the power of an unsupervised approach to capture the molecular and spatial continuums in a tissue context and challenge the rationale for focal therapy in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Copy number variation,Tumorigenesis,Clonal evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew Erickson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emelie Berglund<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengxiao He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maja Marklund<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reza Mirzazadeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niklas Schultz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linda Kvastad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alma Andersson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludvig Bergenstråhle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Bergenstråhle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludvig Larsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alia Shamikh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Basmaci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresita Diaz De Ståhl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Rajakumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim Thrane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew L.

More than 80% of CRCs exhibit chromosomal instability (CIN) and 15-20% microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI results in a high &#8216;tumor mutational burden&#8217; (TMB) and is associated with relatively good prognosis in localized CRC. However, for the large group of CIN CRC patients with localized disease it remains unclear who has a relatively good prognosis and who is at high risk of disease recurrence. CIN is characterized by excessive somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs), which is often summarized as the &#8216;fraction genome altered&#8217; (FGA). In addition, CIN is also characterized by excessive chromosomal rearrangement structural variants (SVs). We quantitated the chromosomal breaks as the &#8216;Tumor Break Load&#8217; (TBL) to investigate the biological impact and clinical relevance of chromosomal breakage in colorectal cancer.<br \/><b>Aim:<\/b> To investigate the biological impact and clinical relevance of TBL in CRC.<br \/><b>Data and Methods:<\/b> We used SCNA, RNA-Seq, and Disease-Free Survival (DFS) data from 633 CRC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. For validation purposes, we used SCNA and DFS data from an independent series of 72 CRC samples. TBL was calculated as the sum of SCNA-associated chromosomal breaks. We used the 25% and 75% quantiles of the TBL distribution as predefined high and low TBL groups to train an RNA expression-based classifier that identifies TBL-associated expression phenotypes as an indicator of biological impact.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Within the group of microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC samples there was a large variety in TBL (median TBL of 54 [1-308]). TBL was poorly correlated with TMB (R<sup>2<\/sup>: 0.06) and FGA (R<sup>2<\/sup>: 0.07). Using RNA expression data as a phenotypic representation of genomic instability, MSI and MSS CRC samples could be classified with high accuracy (AUC: 0.99, p &#60; 0.01), confirming the well-known impact of MSI on tumor biology. Using the same methodology within the group of MSS samples, the TBL could also be classified with high accuracy (AUC: 0.88; p &#60; 0.01). Moreover, high TBL was associated with poor DFS in stage II-III localized MSS CRC (HR: 6.1; p = 0.007). This result was validated in an independent data series of 72 untreated stage II-III localized MSS CRC patients (HR: 3.0; p &#60; 0.02).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>TBL is a characteristic of chromosomal instability that is largely independent from TMB and FGA, with significant impact on tumor biology. Our data indicate that the TBL may be used as a valuable prognostic biomarker for DFS in patients with localized colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Prognostic markers,Tumor Break Load,Chromosomal instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Soufyan Lakbir<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaap Heringa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerrit A.

Tumors from patients of different ancestry groups also have divergent patterns of somatic and germline alterations. This led us to hypothesize that these molecular differences may also contribute to the variable treatment outcomes observed in the clinic.<br \/>We hypothesized that the ancestry of cell lines would impact their genetic dependencies. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged The Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) which has performed genome-wide CRISPR screens across &#38;gt;1,000 cell lines and &#38;gt;30 cancer types. We first leveraged variant calls from WES\/WGS to infer cell line ancestry, then correlated these ancestries with DepMap gene dependency scores. This analysis was underpowered to detect differences in cell lines of African, American, and South Asian descent, since cell lines from these ancestry groups are poorly represented in DepMap, and in cancer research models in general. We were, however, able to detect 71 gene dependencies that were associated with either European or East Asian ancestry.<br \/>Since different ancestry groups have divergent patterns of germline alterations, we reasoned that specific germline alterations may result in ancestry-associated dependencies. Surprisingly, we identified cis-QTLs for &#62;75% of the ancestry-associated genes. We originally hypothesized that these variants would alter the function of the encoded protein, but instead found that these variants mapped to the targeting sequences of the sgRNA. This suggests that ancestry-associated mismatches within sgRNA targeting sequences can preclude Cas9-mediated genome editing.<br \/>To understand this problem systematically, we mapped the germline variants that were catalogued in gnomAD to multiple genome-wide CRISPR libraries. The fraction of affected genes differed from library to library and was typically between 2-5%, but we found that individuals of African descent were consistently more affected by this problem across all CRISPR libraries. This is important because it suggests that cell lines of African descent have a higher rate of false negatives in all CRISPR-based experiments.<br \/>In total, we identified a subset of genes that have ancestry-associated dependency profiles. Most of these genes are the result of ancestry-associated mismatches within the sgRNA targeting sequences. However, many of these genes are not, and require further investigation to understand the influence of ancestry on these genetic dependencies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR,Function Genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sean Alexander Misek<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Fultineer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremie Kalfon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javad Noorbakhsh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabella Boyle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua Dempster<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lia Petronio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James McFarland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rameen Beroukhim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Boehm<\/i><\/presenter>.
