A number of large-scale programs (federal, foundation and industry) have recently been launched across cancer types to develop a temporal and spatial atlas of the cellular and molecular changes associated with the transition of a premalignant lesion to invasive cancer. These efforts are yielding remarkable insights into the biology of premalignancy, that may ultimately lead to biomarkers for detecting aggressive pre-malignant lesions and novel therapeutic targets for disease interception that will transform cancer prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-10 Prevention and treatment of premalignant lesions (intraepithelial neoplasia),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Premalignancy,Early detection,Cancer prevention,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Avrum E.

Oesophageal adenocarcinoma develops gradually from the pre-malignant condition Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus which presents an opportunity to radically improve outcomes from this highly aggressive cancer. Work to unravel the: clinical-demographic and inherited risk factors; the cell of origin of this disease; and the molecular landscape of Barrett&#8217;s samples over time and space, in patients with different outcomes, is shedding light on the disease pathogenesis. Our improved understanding of the disease can be used to develop novel approaches to risk-based population screening and personalised prevention. One emerging paradigm is a triage system that comprises a risk assessment, followed by targeted screening using novel non-endoscopic detection devices coupled with molecular biomarkers to identify individuals at high risk of invasive cancer needing monitoring or preventative treatment. In patients with a Barrett&#8217;s lesion undergoing monitoring, molecular strategies can further distinguish between those with indolent disease versus those likely to progress. As we redesign clinical pathways for this disease we must be sure to maximise patient and clinician acceptability, affordability and ease of access to a given technology while balancing the risks for over-diagnosis and over-treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-11 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Barrett's esophagus,Biomarkers,Risk factors,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rebecca Fitzgerald<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Understanding the molecular basis for cancer susceptibility creates the potential to disrupt the oncogenic process even after it has started. Individuals with pathogenic variants in <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i> are at increased risk for the development of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Work over the past decade has allowed for an understanding of the cells of origin of <i>BRCA1 <\/i>- related breast cancer and has led to a Phase III study of denosumab vs placebo to examine the impact of denosumab on breast cancer risk. The adjuvant study of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in high risk <i>BRCA<\/i>-associated breast cancer demonstrated an improvement in event free survival along with a favorable safety profile, paving the way for further work in the prevention space. Immunologic approaches have led to clinical trials using vaccines which will include healthy <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> carriers. As our molecular understanding of <i>BRCA<\/i> haploinsufficiency improves, so too will our options for cancer interception. All of this work could lead to a halo effect with impact on sporadic cancer interception.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susan M.
