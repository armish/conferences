[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Neoantigen (neoAg)-specific T cells can be found in the peripheral blood of patients with solid tumors, and the infiltration of fresh, peripherally derived T cells into tumors has been associated with successful outcomes after checkpoint blockade therapy. We previously described the development of our PLANET&#8482; manufacturing process to create NPTs, based on the empirical identification of neoAgs using the <i>ex vivo <\/i>ATLAS&#8482; bioassay, for adoptive transfer into patients with cancer. We have initiated the TiTAN&#8482; clinical trial (NCT04596033) to evaluate this candidate immunotherapy, GEN-011, in subjects with checkpoint refractory solid tumors. Here we report the successful manufacturing of NPTs to support the ongoing trial.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Apheresis, FFPE tumor and saliva samples were procured from subjects who consented to participate in the trial. Monocytes and T cells were isolated and cryopreserved. Patient-specific neoAgs against which their T cells were responsive were identified with ATLAS, and up to 30 neoAgs were prioritized for manufacture; pro-tumor Inhibigens&#8482; were excluded. Cryopreserved peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were thawed, monocytes derived into dendritic cells, and then neoAg-specific T cells expanded in the fully closed PLANET manufacturing process. The NPTs were formulated and cryopreserved for administration to patients after release testing.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Subjects with five different solid tumor types contributed to these data: CSC, NSCLC, SCLC, SCCHN, and melanoma. A median of 2.1bn monocytes and 6bn T cells were cryopreserved from apheresis products (N=17). The median TMB was 1.8mut\/Mb (range 0.01-36.6) with 473 somatic mutations (range 32-8893); the number of non-synonymous mutations ranged from 9 to 767. ATLAS screens identified a mean of 13&#177;4 neoAgs and 11&#177;3 Inhibigens, resulting in an average of 13 (range 2-30) unique neoAgs in each PLANET manufacturing process. Upon conclusion of manufacturing, the mean yield per patient was 1.6&#177;0.3bn NPTs across runs (N=9) completed by the time of data cutoff. Characterization tests revealed the NPTs were consistently 80-90% CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and 10-20% CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, of which 97% (range 64.9-99.8%) were effector memory and 1% (range 0.1-32.3%) central memory. The median purity at release was 98% with 82% viability. By functional assessments, the NPTs retained specificity for 91% (range 82-100%) of their intended neoAg targets (N=4). Administratable doses were successfully manufactured for 100% of patients to date.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>NPTs can routinely be manufactured in a GMP setting to treat patients with solid tumors. By expanding fresh, non-exhausted NeoAg-specific T cells with known tumor specificity from the periphery, GEN-011 has the potential to provide clinical benefits of TIL with greater accessibility and minimal irrelevant T cells. The TiTAN trial is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86f51783-8ced-407e-9876-a9051af14289\/@q03B8ZBL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,T cell,Neoantigens,Human,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16553"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"ed42bc9b-7183-489d-8f13-720cf356a970","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed42bc9b-7183-489d-8f13-720cf356a970\/@q03B8ZBL\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Harshal Zope<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rounak Nande<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manish Jain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charley Hubbard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louisa Dowal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Foti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Loizeaux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Crystal Cabral<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel B.

Although effective, anti-PD-1 therapy is limited by poor penetration into the tumor, internalization, and endocytic clearance, in contrast with TIL, which overcome this inherent limitation.<i> PDCD-1<\/i> gene inactivation (PD-1 KO) may enhance TIL cell therapy efficacy in the post-ICI setting and abrogate the need for systemic anti-PD-1 therapy in ICI-na&#239;ve pts. In preclinical studies, PD-1 KO TIL maintain robust effector function and phenotypic markers indicative of functional TIL (Ritthipichai ESMO 2020). We describe preclinical activity, clinical-scale manufacturing process development, and characterization of IOV-4001, an autologous PD-1 KO TIL cell product.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> hIL-2 NOG mice engrafted with melanoma tumor cells received adoptive transfer of autologous PD-1 KO TIL (developed with TALEN&#174; gene editing technology in collaboration with Cellectis), mock TIL (electroporation without TALEN), mock TIL + anti-PD-1 antibody, or no adoptive transfer (n=14 each). Tumor size was measured 2&#215;\/wk for 39 days. A 22-day clinical-scale manufacturing process was established, including pre-rapid expansion protocol (pre-REP), activation, electroporation, resting, and REP, for the generation of PD-1 KO TIL. Final PD-1 KO TIL product was characterized for total viable cells (TVC), purity (% viability), identity (% CD45<sup>+<\/sup>CD3<sup>+<\/sup>), and function (PD-1 KO efficiency).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Day 39 mean &#177; SEM tumor size (mm<sup>2<\/sup>) for mice treated with PD-1 KO TIL (6 &#177; 2.8) showed superior tumor control relative to mock TIL (26 &#177; 8.5, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05), mock TIL + anti-PD-1 (33 &#177; 8.8, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.01), and no adoptive TIL transfer (112 &#177; 8.4, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.0001).

PD-1 KO TIL function and phenotype (differentiation, memory, activation, and exhaustion) were comparable to mock TIL.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Anti-tumor activity of PD-1 KO TIL was superior to mock TIL suggesting that endogenous PD-1 inhibition may confer a functional advantage to the TIL over an antibody combination. PD-1 KO TIL clinical manufacturing was feasible and the TIL product quality attributes and phenotype were acceptable; importantly, lack of complete PD-1 KO may spare other PD-1-dependent in vivo cellular functions.

For certain clinical products, cell concentration is synonymous with dosage, and proper cell viability is crucial to avoidance of potential harmful side effects. The complex nature of patient-derived samples makes legacy cell analysis methods such as the trypan blue exclusion assay difficult or impossible to perform. Nonspecific objects such as RBCs and cellular debris can significantly increase cell counting variation. Meanwhile, the need for cell-based products that are custom-tailored to each patient has resulted in the analysis of smaller and more numerous batches, leading to cell counting bottlenecks. With the challenges of messy samples and counting bottlenecks in mind, we investigate the use of the Cellaca&#8482; MX, a cell counter that can increase throughput and employ fluorescence-based cell counting methods. The high-throughput cell counter can utilize 5 fluorescence imaging channels for cell count and viability analysis in less than 3 min for 24 samples. In addition, fluorescent cell-based assays such as apoptosis (Annexin V or Caspase 3\/7), cell cycle, reactive oxygen species measurement can be performed to better characterize the target cell samples. In this work, we demonstrate the capabilities of Cellaca&#8482; MX for high-throughput fluorescence-based cell counting. Comparison among multiple instruments using Jurkat cells and fluorescent beads reveals high consistency between replicate counts, between Cellaca consumable plates, and between instruments. We also compare cell counts made on the Cellaca&#8482; MX with manual counts performed using a hemocytometer, as well as counts performed using other fluorescence-based automated cell counting methods. In addition, we illustrate the use of the ISO 20391-II cell counting standard to evaluate and compare the performance of cell counting methods. Finally, we include real-world primary T cell linearity results over a 4-log range of concentration. The results of the experiments confirm the suitability of the Cellaca&#8482; MX for general fluorescence-based assays applicable to cell therapy-related workflows.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb720bcf-e494-4f3e-bdd4-bc9e31d3101d\/@q03B8ZBL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Assay development,Cell proliferation,Cell counting,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16556"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jordan Bell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongyang Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Yung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henry Qazi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Hernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Bo Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leo Chan<\/i><\/presenter>.

So far, the focus of immunotherapies has mainly been on the modulation of T-cells. Natural killer (NK) cells offer promising perspectives for immunotherapies as they directly kill tumor cells and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate and recruit T-cells and other immune cells. Thus, NK cells are considered key players in the anti-tumor immune response that can make a &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor &#8220;hot&#8221;. However, in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of cancer patients, the low numbers of NK cells present and their exhaustion due to local immunosuppression often limit tumor cell killing. The development of NK based cell therapy products can overcome these limitations, either as single therapy or in combination with biologics such as e.g. NK cell engagers or monoclonal antibodies for boosting ADCC (antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity). To overcome the main hurdle of current autologous cell therapies, the EVO<i>cells<\/i> Oncology platform aims at developing a streamlined manufacturing process for iPSC-derived immune effector cells. The goal is to develop &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; cell therapy products for clinical use in large patient populations. We are currently establishing a multi-asset portfolio combining multiple immune effector cell types with different genetic editing strategies that serve to optimize this approach further. iPSC-derived NK cells (iNK cells) offer an attractive option for improving both therapeutic efficacy and safety of CAR cell therapies. Our robust, feeder-free production protocol produces iNK cells that can be reliably frozen with good recovery rates. We have generated multiple genetically modified iNK cells and have validated that the genetic modifications boost iNK function.<i> <\/i>At the end of the production process, iNK cells show phenotypic properties and single cell RNA sequencing profiles comparable to blood-derived NK cells. Importantly, iNK cells are fully functional with the ability to produce key pro-inflammatory cytokines and to form lytic immunological synapses leading to efficient killing of cancer cell lines. In addition to the killing of established tumor cell lines, we also evaluated the ability of iNK cells to kill primary leukemia cells <i>ex vivo <\/i>by using blood samples from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. In combination with a standard of care anti-CD20 antibody, iNK cells demonstrated the ability to kill primary leukemia cells via ADCC. Taken together, these promising results obtained with iNK cells show the potential of the EVO<i>cells<\/i> Oncology platform to deliver the next generation of cell therapies in oncology paving the way to develop a portfolio of iPSC-derived immune effector cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/286e660e-a188-4238-b06e-639924c34453\/@q03B8ZBL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Adoptive immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16557"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Esquerré<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Holtzinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mélanie Pichery<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Pfaender<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saniye Yumlu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mandy Richter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Delphine Betous<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oriane Bombarde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mylène Gador<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadja Sailer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Paillasse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loïc Ysebaert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabien Despas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Austen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Scheel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markus Dangl<\/i><\/presenter>.

Two main approaches for T-cell-based therapies involve molecular T cell redirection by CD3 bispecific molecules such as bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE) and cellular T cell redirection by genetic modification of T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) or transgenic T cell receptors (TCR). <b><\/b> BiTEs redirect the cytotoxic activity of endogenous polyclonal T cells by simultaneously engaging CD3 on T cells and tumor antigens on target cells. Hitherto, BiTE potency studies have relied on primary cells, which measure target cell killing through redirected T cell cytotoxicity (RTCC) or cytokine release. However, these primary cell-based assays suffer from high donor-to-donor variability, as well as lengthy and hard to implement protocols. We have recently developed a new NanoBiT-based assay platform-based RTCC assay and cytokine immunoassays that are simple, sensitive and can quantitatively measure the potency of CD3 bispecific antibodies or BiTEs and similar biologics that induce T Cell-dependent target cell killing and cytokine production. In this assay, preactivated, Thaw-and-Use cytotoxic T cells and target cells stably expressing HaloTag-HiBiT are co-incubated with a BiTE, which results in lysis of the target cells and release of HiBiT proteins. These HiBiT proteins then bind to LgBiT in the detection reagent and form functional NanoLuc Luciferase to generate luminescence. The assay is homogenous, highly sensitive, and has a robust assay window. Furthermore, BiTE-induced cytokine production (e.g IL-2 and IFN gamma) from the activated cytotoxic T cells can be quantitatively measured in the homogenous NanoBiT Immunoassays. Use of CAR-T has demonstrated promising results in treating leukemia, while the development of TCR-engineered T cells that can recognize intracellular tumor antigens, is still in early stages. To facilitate the screening and characterization of new transgenic TCRs, we used CRISPR\/Cas9 to develop two TCRab-null reporter T cell lines, which are CD4+ or CD8+. Reintroduction of peptide-specific TCR a and b chains into TCRab-null reporter T cell lines results in peptide-dependent TCR activation and luciferase reporter expression. The select expression of CD4 or CD8 in the TCRab-null reporter T cell lines can enable the development of transgenic TCRs for both MHCI- and MHCII-restricted tumor antigen targets. Together, these bioluminescent bioassays represent a new set of tools for the discovery and development of T cell-based immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/32c7a9d9-7463-403e-be38-574fddde5afb\/@r03B8ZBM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,CAR T cells,BiTE antibody,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16558"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Julia Gilden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamison Grailer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Slater<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pete Stecha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Hartnett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Lazar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gopal Krishnan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mei Cong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhijie Jey Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

We utilized quantitative pharmacologic assays in vitro and dual-flank efficacy\/selectivity models in vivo to test the activity of a variety of constructs comprised of: (i) CAR &#8220;activators&#8221; that target tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) such as CEA, MSLN and others; and, (ii) LIR-1-based &#8220;blockers&#8221; that target HLA class I proteins. We generated substantial datasets around multiple targets, including well known tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). In the presence of the HLA class I blocker antigen, Tmod cells were OFF within a wide range of activator antigen expression levels on the &#8220;normal&#8221; target cells. They were ON when tumor cells expressed the TAA without the HLA blocker antigen, and killed tumor cells selectively even in mixed tumor-normal cell populations. The Tmod system transformed imperfect TAAs into true tumor-selective targets, where the activity of the engineered T cells is controlled by the presence\/absence of the HLA blocker antigen. The system was sufficiently modular to use with autologous and allogeneic products. Several of these Tmod constructs are advancing to the clinic where a robust genetic selection tool is being used to screen patients for treatment and match them with a suitable Tmod therapy. In summary, Tmod is a robust system with quantitative pharmacologic behavior in preclinical models consistent with efficacy and safety across a range of targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/340109cf-710a-4202-9db5-f4443de4c0b1\/@r03B8ZBM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Loss of heterozygosity,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16559"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Han Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agnes Hamburger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yuta Ando<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Asuelime<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristian Bolanos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Daris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Breanna DiAndreth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria C.

GPC3 promotes Wnt-dependent cell proliferation, and its expression is correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. NK cells exhibit innate anti-tumor activity owing to the expression of multiple activating receptors, such as NKp46. NKp46 is expressed in all NK cells including tumor-infiltrating NK cells. FLEX-NKTrademark is a proprietary platform for production of tetravalent IgG1-like multifunctional antibody NK engagers with a novel FLEX-linker to allow for simultaneous binding of both the targeted cancer cells and NK cells. A novel humanized NKp46 binder that does not induce NKp46 internalization and a humanized GPC3 binder that targets the membrane-proximal lobe of the GPC3 were combined on the novel FLEX-NKTrademark scaffold to create the NK engager CYT-303. CYT-303 has higher affinity for GPC3 compared to NKp46 to skew binding preferentially to GPC3 expressing tumor cells prior to binding NK cells expressing NKp46 to optimize targeted killing. CYT-303 showed significantly higher dose dependent peripheral blood NK cell redirected cytotoxicity and degranulation against GPC3 expressing Hep3B tumor cells compared to GPC3 or NKp46 monoclonal antibodies alone suggesting that co-engagement of NKp46 and GPC3 via an immunological synapse is required for optimal tumor killing by CYT-303. Low NK cell numbers or suppression of NK cell function in the tumor microenvironment may limit the clinical activity of FLEX-NKTrademark engagers. iNK cells derived from iPSC, a uniform starting material with unlimited self-renewal capabilities, can be expanded to produce a universal off-the-shelf allogeneic therapy that can be used in combination with FLEX-NKTrademark engagers. We studied the efficacy of the combination of a FLEX-NKTrademark antibody and iNKs. The iNK cells express high levels of multiple activation receptors including NKp46 and showed good cytotoxic activity against HCC cell line Hep3B. The iNKs also showed anti-tumor activity in NSG-hIL15 mice bearing HCC subcutaneous tumors as demonstrated by the presence of CD56<sup>+<\/sup>CD3<sup>-<\/sup>, NKp46<sup>+<\/sup>, NKG2D<sup>+<\/sup> iNKs in the tumors at day 21 post-intratumoral injection of the iNKs.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of two major immunosuppressive cytokines found in the tumor microenvironment (IL-10 and TGF-&#946;) on the tumor cytolytic function and cytokine release by SUPLEXA cells.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>SUPLEXA cells were prepared by a 14-day process of PBMC induction by ENLIST cells for 5 days followed by 9 days expansion in cytokines. SUPLEXA cell mediated tumor cytolytic assays using red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing M14 melanoma cells as targets were performed in the absence or presence of IL-10 or TGF-&#946; (1.25 - 10 ng\/ml). Cytokine levels in 48-hour culture supernatants from cytolytic reactions and SUPLEXA or M14 target cells alone were measured using a 36-plex Luminex assay. Without cytokine addition, SUPLEXA mediated cytolysis was 47.3% at 8:1 and 30.9% at 4:1 effector to target (E:T) ratios. Significant increases in SUPLEXA cell tumoricidal activity was observed with addition of IL-10 (74.3% at 8:1 and 51.7% at 4:1 E:T ratios at 2.5 ng\/ml IL-10 added, P &#38;It 0.001 by two-way ANOVA). Adding TGF-&#946; caused a reduction in cytolytic activity that was not significant (36.5% at 8:1 and 20.8% at 4:1 E:T ratios with 2.5 ng\/ml TGF-&#946; added). Supernatants from cytolysis assays showed that SUPLEXA cells produced IFN&#947;, MIP-1&#945;, RANTES, IL-8, Gro-&#945;, MIG, and IP-10 in response to tumor cells. IL-10 significantly augmented IFN&#947;, RANTES, and MIP-1&#945; production by SUPLEXA cells in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, TGF-&#946; reduced IFN&#947;, MIP-1&#945;, Gro-&#945;, RANTES, and IP-10 production, but increased IL-8 production by SUPLEXA cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>An <i>in vitro<\/i> approach was used as a surrogate for what might occur in patients with solid tumors to test whether potent immune suppressive cytokines that are present in the tumor microenvironment might inhibit SUPLEXA cell function. Our findings indicate that IL-10 and TGF-&#946; do not significantly reduce the tumor killing activity of SUPLEXA cells. Instead, we discovered that IL-10 significantly enhances SUPLEXA cell function and cytokine production, which suggests that SUPLEXA cells may acquire heightened tumoricidal activity and promote immune surveillance by augmenting cytokine and chemokine levels within the tumor microenvironment when given therapeutically to cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5bdef24f-9295-49ef-96a8-9832c3ae9fa9\/@r03B8ZBM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Immunosuppression,TGF-&#946;,Interleukin-10,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16561"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Frank Borriello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua W.

Studies have suggested that T-cell exhaustion plays a role in limiting the ability of CAR T cells to eradicate solid tumors. Additionally, stem-like qualities of T cells have been associated with better outcomes in patients treated with cellular therapies, including CAR T cells. Therefore, maintaining stem-like qualities and overcoming T-cell exhaustion may be key to improving clinical efficacy of CAR T cells in patients with solid tumors.<br \/>ROR1 is a cell surface antigen expressed in several solid tumor types and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). ROR1 expression has been reported in 57% of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), as well as 42% of adenocarcinoma and 12% of squamous cell carcinoma subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These expression data of ROR1 in TNBC and NSCLC provide support for anti-ROR1 agents as a therapeutic strategy for these cancers.<br \/>LYL797 is a novel, ROR1-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product that incorporates genetic and epigenetic reprogramming technologies, Gen-R and Epi-R, to overcome barriers of CAR T-cell therapies in solid tumors. The ROR1-specific CAR contains a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from an R12 rabbit monoclonal antibody that recognizes and binds with high specificity to human ROR1.<br \/>Gen-R is <i>ex vivo<\/i> genetic reprogramming technology that engineers CAR T cells to overexpress c-Jun. Dysregulation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) has been implicated in CAR T-cell exhaustion, and studies have demonstrated that overexpression of c-Jun renders CAR T cells less susceptible to exhaustion, enhancing both anti-tumor efficacy and persistence in preclinical models of hematologic and solid tumors. Epi-R is a proprietary optimized manufacturing process that results in maintenance of stem-like phenotype and function of T-cell products. In preclinical studies LYL797 cells reprogrammed with Gen-R and Epi-R led to improved functional activity in the presence of ROR1+ tumor cells compared to conventional ROR1 CAR T cells.<br \/>Additional studies are underway to determine the mechanisms by which antitumor activity of LYL797 in ROR1-positive solid tumor xenograft models is enhanced. LYL797 is anticipated to enter into Phase 1 clinical trials for TNBC and NSCLC in 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30932bcc-f487-44a8-bb9e-f28ed5c2c145\/@r03B8ZBM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Lung cancer: non-small cell,ROR1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16562"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"007ebce5-442d-4646-9dea-e05c595ff80d","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/007ebce5-442d-4646-9dea-e05c595ff80d\/@r03B8ZBM\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Spencer Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Courtney Simianer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sydney Spadinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Purnima Sundar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shobha Potluri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Lynn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bijan Boldajipour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neeraj Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hajime Hiraragi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veena Krishnamoorthy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suman Kumar Vodnala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>E-Ching Ong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chang-Chih Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Wohlfahrt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byoung Ryu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian D.

We have developed a protocol that produces expanded and highly activated NK (eNK) cells from healthy human donors that have been shown to be effective alone and in combination with monoclonal antibodies in a variety of hematological malignancies. The eNK cells showed a dramatic increase in cytolytic capacity after their expansion and activation using IL-2, IL-15, and 721.221 feeder cells. In order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind the changes, mRNAseq and miRNA arrays were performed on mRNA and miRNA samples, respectively, extracted from several NK expansions, taken at Day 0 (before activation) and Day 20 (after activation and expansion). Bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify differential gene expression changes and their downstream effects. Based on the genes with greatest differential expression, we quantified their corresponding proteins using flow cytometry, western blots, and ELISAs. Results reveal several discrete changes in the transcriptome that are reflected in changes in protein expression levels within the eNK cells. We conclude that the increased cytolytic capacity of eNK cells is due to the synergistic effect of variations in different genes responsible for target recognition, effector function, cell cycle progression and cell survival. These data can be used in the future to produce better eNK cells as treatment for hematological malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f6bd1af-fc8e-47b0-905d-9378f03aa8ad\/@r03B8ZBM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Immuno-oncology,Adoptive immunotherapy,mRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16563"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chantal Reina-Ortiz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pilar Mozas Alonso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Cebollada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Ovelleiro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Alberto Anel Bernal<\/i><\/presenter>.

While CARs are known to trigger an effective immune response through surface antigen recognition many solid tumor cancer antigens are intracellular and presented by MHC molecules recognized by T cell receptors (TCRs). In addition, many therapeutic antibodies have shown clinical efficacy in solid tumor settings. However, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is mediated by the CD16 Fc receptor naturally expressed on NK cells although its application in T cells is yet not fully appreciated. Utilizing our proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) platform to engineer multiple modalities into a clonal iPSC line, which can serve as the starting cell source for mass production of off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR-T cells (CAR-iT cells), we aimed to study the combination of these three targeting modalities, CAR, TCR, and CD16, to determine whether challenges associated with the treatment of solid tumors, which are heterogeneous and challenging to treat, may be overcome.To test the base line activity of CAR-iT cells in the solid tumor setting, we selected our anti-MICA\/B CAR, previously shown to effectively target stress ligands found on transformed cells, to demonstrate effective anti-tumor activity against multiple solid tumor cell lines (72 hrs cytotoxicity: A2058 = 99%; 786-O = 98%; versus non-specific CAR-iT cells: A258 = 13%; 786-O = 17%). To test compatibility of TCR in our iT cell platform, we engineered MR1-TCR in iT cells to show increased cytokine release and degranulation upon stimulated with MR1 positive lung carcinoma epithelial cells line A549 (fold change compared to un-stimulated: IFNg = 210, p = 0.0032; TNFa = 76.9, p = 0.0005; CD107ab = 115.0, p=0.0013). Notably, with the engineering of tumor antigen specific TCR in TCR-less CAR-iT cells, CD3 complex can be re-established to provide an opportunity to combine with bispecific T cell engagers. Lastly, combining CAR-iT cells with MR1-TCR and hnCD16 uniquely demonstrated synergistic tumor growth inhibition and validated our approach to target multiple antigens at once for an effective anti-tumor response (A549 cytotoxicity: tumor only = 3.68&#177;2.04%; effector+TCR = 41.31&#177;2.27%; effector+TCR+ADCC = 90.28&#177;1.87%). In summary, using the unique approach to engineer iPSCs at the clonal level to create a distinct population of engineered iT cells, we successfully demonstrated the compatibility between CAR, TCR, and hnCD16 to mitigate tumor heterogeneity. This approach is an ideal strategy to create off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapy for a promising therapeutic approach to combat heterogeneous and difficult to treat solid tumors, including those that are resistant due to antigen escape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/52c9a322-c9e1-426d-befa-55dc790aac50\/@r03B8ZBM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,ADCC,Chimeric antigen receptor,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16565"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chia-Wei Chang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bi-Huei Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eason Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soheila Shirinbak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen-I Yeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mochtar Pribadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helen Chu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alma Gutierrez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Earl Avramis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason ORourke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alec Witty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eigen Peralta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Hosking<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bahram Valamehr<\/i><\/presenter>.

This neoTCR discovery and validation process is being applied in a clinical trial (NCT03970382) evaluating personalized neoTCR-T cell therapy in solid tumors. The PACTImmune Database (PIDB) accumulates extensive pre-, on- and post-treatment data related to this trial. Here we present PIDB data on the prediction of peptide-HLA manufacturing success, as well as correlates of success of neoTCR capture and neoTCR T cell tumor trafficking, all of which have direct applications for prospective patient enrollment and treatment.<br \/>The PIDB contains distinct data sets on our neoTCR platform that we examined for predictive capabilities for three distinct applications. The first application was predicting manufacturing success rates of our single chain trimer (comPACT) which consists of the predicted neoE peptide together with B2M and the HLA heavy chain. Using multiple linear regression (MLR), we built a model predicting success rates of comPACT protein manufacturing (defined as comPACT protein yields &#62;detection threshold) and compared it to prediction based solely on expressed tumor mutation burden (eTMB). Using univariate analysis, we compared variables between patients with 3 neoTCRs selected versus those with 0 neoTCRs. Finally, using principal component analysis (PCA) we evaluated if the PIDB neoantigen and TCR characteristics correlate with neoTCR T cell trafficking in patients (n=4) dosed with neoTCR T cells. Trafficking was determined by sequencing (neoTCR specific reads) and in some cases, IHC\/RNAScope imaging of post-dosing biopsies.<br \/>MLR analysis of comPACT protein expression data resulted in significant improvement in comPACT manufacturing success rate predictions (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.66, P&#60;&#60;0.001). These predictions were better than using eTMB alone (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.33, P&#60;&#60;0.001). Patients with 3 neoTCRs selected had a significantly higher number of comPACTs and mutations covered by those comPACTs as compared to 0 neoTCR patients (P=0.004 and 0.002, respectively). All four patients demonstrated trafficking of neoTCR products into the tumor in post-dosing biopsies. Based on TCR characteristics PCA showed separation between tumor trafficking and non-trafficking TCRs (data pending).<br \/>Application of PIDB data improves predictions of peptide-HLA manufacturing success, identifies differences between patients with 3 and no neoTCR products and provides insights into trafficking TCR characteristics, which in turn enables us to optimize our neoTCR selection strategy for patients with solid cancers. PIDB thus represents a significant &#38; maturing dataset for patient-specific tumor immunogenicity in solid cancers and provides opportunities to optimize personalized neoTCR T cell treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4b080097-ccc4-4395-91cd-44ab8b251104\/@r03B8ZBM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Databases,T cell,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16566"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eric W.

A major limitation of CAR19 therapy is the steep relapse rate within 6 months of treatment, often due to the loss or diminution of tumor cell CD19 expression. ALETA-001 is a CAR-T Engager protein that contains the CD19 extracellular domain (ECD), an anti-CD20 VHH, and an anti-albumin VHH for half-life extension. When combined with CAR19 T cells, ALETA-001 triggers cytotoxicity through CD19 bound to CD20, thus increasing total target antigen density and preventing relapse due to loss of CD19 expression. ALETA-001 will enter Cancer Research UK-sponsored Phase 1\/2 clinical trials in CAR19-treated NHL patients next year.<br \/>We made novel variants of ALETA-001 including CAR-T Engagers with alternative anti-CD20 modules and CAR-T Engagers that target both CD20 and a second B cell cancer antigen. Further, we extended our technology to target Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), using novel antigen binding domains and immunomodulatory functional domains.<br \/>Site-directed mutagenesis was used to make ALETA-001 variants. We mutated the complementary determining regions, CDR2 and\/or CDR3, within the anti-CD20 VHH. The novel CAR-T Engager Proteins were evaluated for binding to CD19-negative\/CD20-positive lymphoma cells and for cytotoxicity against those cells in the presence of CAR19 T cells. Further, CAR-T Engagers were made that contained novel CD20 binding domains and binding domains to other B cell antigens. In addition, we created a novel CAR-T engager that contains the CD19 ECD and binding domains to two AML antigens, plus an immunomodulatory domain. This novel CAR-T engager is designed to treat CD19-positive Mixed Phenotype Leukemia (MPL) and other forms of AML.<br \/>We evaluated the series of CDR mutations in the ALETA-001 anti-CD20 VHH. A spectrum of activities was observed, with mutations that retained full CD20 binding and cytotoxic activity to those with partial or no activity. A series of constructs with distinct anti-CD20 binding domains were also evaluated, with some found to be equipotent with ALETA-001. Constructs binding both CD20 and a second B cell tumor antigen were prepared and assayed and found to have potent activity against either or both antigens. Finally, CAR-T Engagers directed to AML antigens were able to bind each antigen individually, and mediated potent toxicity with the addition of CAR19 T cells.<br \/>We conclude that the CAR-T Engager platform offers robust and modular anti-tumor functionality, featuring potent multi-antigen targeting for diverse indications. Finally, we can incorporate other useful immunomodulatory activities into Engager proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7a965ab9-0b35-460f-b5de-a27e839429b9\/@r03B8ZBM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,T cell engager,Tumor antigen,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16568"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul D.

This is similar to the neurological manifestations of serum hypophosphatemia, which typically results from sudden increased metabolic demand for phosphorylated intermediates, as in the setting of refeeding syndrome. Given these similarities, we investigated whether CAR T cell effector metabolic activity is associated with increased extracellular phosphate consumption, and the association of serum hypophosphatemia with ICANS.<br \/>Methods: Human CAR T cells expressing anti-CD19scFV linked to either 4-1BB-CD28-CD3z or CD28-CD3z signaling domains were co-cultured with CD19+\/firefly luciferase+ Raji cells. Media phosphorus consumption and cell cytotoxicity were assessed throughout co-culture. Single cell cytokine polyfunctionality of CAR T cells was measured via IsoPlexis platform. Oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic activity of CAR T cells were measured via Agilent Seahorse assay. In parallel, we retrospectively analyzed 77 patients treated with CD28 or 41BB anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy. A linear mixed effects model was generated from this dataset to assess the temporal relationship between longitudinal serum phosphorus measurements and ICANS\/CARTOX-10 scores (clinical measures of CAR T neurotoxicity).<br \/>Results: When co-cultured with Raji cells, 4-1BBz consumed 75.9% more phosphate (p=0.0019) and CD28z consumed 69.9% more phosphate (p=0.0048) compared to mock CAR T cells. Phosphate consumption was associated with increased Raji cell killing (4-1BBz: 97.0%, p=0.0011; CD28z: 89.5%, p=0.0015), increased single cell cytokine polyfunctionality, and increased cellular metabolic demand (oxidative and glycolytic ATP production rate). Of 77 patients treated with CD19 CAR T cells, 23 developed ICANS. A linear mixed effects model predicted a 0.29mg\/dL decrease in serum phosphorus for each grade increment in ICANS score (p&#60;0.0001) and a 0.11mg\/dL decrease in serum phosphorus for each point of decrease in CARTOX-10 (p=0.0025). Importantly, this model predicts neurotoxicity only when drops in serum phosphorus bring patients into significant hypophosphatemia (&#60;2.7mg\/dL). The strength of the relationship is also dependent on time, with serum phosphorus decreases occurring shortly after cell infusion having stronger correlation with ICANS\/CARTOX-10 scores.<br \/>Conclusions: Our data suggest the increased metabolic demand of adoptively transferred CAR T cells, as a consequence of their cytokinetic polyfunctionality and antigen directed cytotoxic activity, may drive a state of hypophosphatemia, which is associated with ICANS in CAR T cell therapy. Early phosphate repletion may help mitigate the neurologic toxicity of CAR T cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4d2afde2-1771-494b-91b4-df4a3c208868\/@s03B8ZBN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,ICANS,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16569"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jack Pengfei Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cole W.

Due to its broad expression on a wide variety of solid tumors and minimal expression on normal tissues, B7-H3 is an ideal tumor antigen target. Additionally, high levels of B7-H3 are found on &#8220;immunologically cold&#8221; tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer and soft tissue sarcomas, which typically have poor response to approved immune therapies. To effectively target B7-H3 with an off-the-shelf cellular therapy, we describe here the development of camB7-H3 CAR-NK cell utilizing our iPSC platform to engineer multiple modalities into a clonal iPSC line, which can serve as the starting cell source for mass production of off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR-NK cells (CAR-iNK cells).<br \/>Methods: A camelid nanobody specific for human B7-H3 (camB7-H3) was discovered using a phage display library and validated in functional assays. camB7-H3 CAR-iNK cells were designed to 1) express membrane-bound IL-15\/IL-15 receptor fusion for enhanced persistence, 2) have a CD38 knockout to improve metabolic fitness, 3) express a high-affinity non-cleavable CD16 to maximize ADCC when combined with a therapeutic antibody, and 4) express an anti-camB7-H3 CAR optimized for NK cell signaling. As the initial preclinical study, camB7-H3 CAR-iNK cells were assessed using flow cytometry-based functional assays evaluating CD107a and IFN&#947; or xCelligence target killing assays against B7-H3 transgenic or naturally expressing tumor cell lines.<br \/>Results: The camelid single domain B7-H3 initially tested in CAR-T exhibited B7-H3 specific binding and specific activity against several solid tumor cell lines (breast, ovarian, prostate, lung). We next produced camB7-H3 CAR-iNK cells and demonstrated superior B7-H3-specific target elimination compared to untransduced iNK cells. These results were seen across multiple tumor lines representing various solid tumor indications. Further enhancement of anti-tumor efficacy was seen when combined with therapeutic antibodies, including trastuzumab and cetuximab.<br \/>Conclusions: We have successfully produced and validated the specificity and function of an engineered camB7-H3 CAR-iNK cell exhibiting robust target killing and on-target specificity. To our knowledge, this is the first camelid nanobody antigen recognition domain reported in a CAR-NK cell to be used as an off-the-shelf immunotherapy. The combining camB7-H3 CAR-NK with monoclonal antibodies targeting HER2 and EGFR as a dual targeting approach will add additional tumor specificity, further increase the efficacy of tumor cell elimination and prevent antigen escape. Additional camB7-H3 CAR-iNK cell preclinical studies are in process and will be discussed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d9162298-a876-4f3d-b1ee-4462f8ba01f2\/@s03B8ZBN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,CAR T cells,B7-H3,Prostate Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16570"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicholas Zorko<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Cichocki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Goulding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan Hancock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Blum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mochtar Pribadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bjoern Gaertner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Felices<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Bjordahl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bahram Valamehr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey S.

For personalized treatment and to minimize &#8220;off-target&#8221; effects, neoantigens have become an attractive class of targets. While Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) have served as the main source of neoantigen-reactive TCRs (NeoTCRs), this strategy requires the patient to undergo surgery to obtain tumor samples. Circulating T cells are an alternative source for neoantigen-reactive T cells; however, the frequency of NeoTCRs in the blood is extremely low. Several approaches have been developed aiming to enrich these cells or isolate their TCRs by cell-sorting of cells expressing activation or exhaustion markers. Yet, the expression of these nonspecific markers by bystander T cells hampers the efficiency of these methods. Here, we sought to study the transcriptional and protein markers of circulating neoantigen-reactive CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) coupled with TCR-Seq and Cellular Indexing of Transcriptome and Epitope by Sequencing (CITE-Seq) from apheresis. To this end, we FACS-enriched neoantigen-reactive T cells from blood samples from 3 patients using pHLA tetramers of neoantigens previously discovered in autologous TIL samples. To be able to study the differences in the phenotype of these cells and other subsets of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cells in the blood, including viral-targeting T cells, we mixed tetramer<sup>pos<\/sup> and tetramer<sup>neg <\/sup>cells prior to sequencing. Projecting NeoTCRs onto phenotypic clusters showed a distinct population of these clones with upregulation of CD45RO, HLA-DR and -DP, and exhaustion markers (CD39, CD103, PD-1, etc.). To circumvent the limitation of tetramers (HLA tetramer availability, defined neoantigens and minimal epitopes) we FACS-sorted CD45RO<sup>+<\/sup>HLA-DRA<sup>hi<\/sup>-CD39<sup>+<\/sup>,<sup> <\/sup>-CD103<sup>+ <\/sup>single-positive, and -CD39<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+ <\/sup>double-positive cells, based on our CITE-Seq results, to enrich for neoantigen-reactive cells from 3 additional patients. Transcriptional analysis of all 6 patient samples allowed us to define a distinct gene-signature of circulating neoantigen-reactive CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cells that showed an activated resident-memory-like phenotype. Moreover, using the surface markers that were identified in our analysis we FACS-sorted CD45RO<sup>+<\/sup>HLA-DRA<sup>hi<\/sup>CD39<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+ <\/sup>cells from blood samples into 96-well plates and performed single-cell TCR sequencing. We were able to detect NeoTCRs in 6 out of 8 patients, with frequencies ranging from 4-50% of the sorted cells. In summary, we were able to phenotype low-frequency neoantigen-reactive CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from blood samples and develop a simple sorting method that can bypass the need for invasive surgery, allowing isolation of TCRs that can be engineered into autologous lymphocytes to treat patients with metastatic cancer","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/47c70143-6cfb-4601-8be9-4f6f1ac5facb\/@s03B8ZBN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Adoptive cell therapy,Neoantigens,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16571"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rami Yoseph<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sri Krishna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank J.

However, the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment (TME) can inhibit NK-92 function thereby limiting its cytolytic properties against tumor cells. To address this limitation, we serially passaged and maintained NK-92 cell lines under tumor microenvironment culture conditions (2.0 PSI + 1% O2) for a minimum of 5+ weeks. This adaptation period was used to precondition and expand NK cells with lower oxygen dependency, enriching for subset of cells that have metabolically adapted to pressurized and hypoxic culture conditions. NK cells maintained and expanded under TME culture conditions gradually reduced their cell-doubling times to reach parity with parental lines maintained under ambient oxygen (21% O2) culture conditions. This adaptation period coincided with improved tumor killing properties for TME-Adapted NK cells (TANK) against the non-small cell lung cancer cell line, A549. Enhanced cytolytic activity of TANK cells was two-fold greater than their non-TME adapted counterparts, with sustained potency observed in both ambient and TME screening conditions. Furthermore, serial exhaustion studies where TANK cells were repeatedly stimulated with tumor cells show sustained cytolytic activity, in contrast to non-TME adapted NK92 counterparts. TANK cells also exhibit higher levels of granzyme B and perforin as assessed by flow cytometry, while exhibiting distinct gene expression signatures as profiled with RNAseq. This initial study supports the hypothesis that immune cells can both react and adapt to different microenvironments. TME-adaptation strategies during cell expansion can enhance potency and efficacy of cell therapies designed to work in a solid tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aeace446-a7ee-49a1-add5-31bd4dc1e2c5\/@s03B8ZBN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Immunosuppression,Adoptive cell therapy,Tumor hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16572"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ann Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunmin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albert Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>James Lim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The number of ACT trials in solid tumors has been increasing, however data are limited on the overall safety and efficacy of ACT in this population. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis looking specifically at TCR and CAR-T in solid tumors and rates of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) relative to the current approved agents in hematologic malignancies.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a systematic review of published studies \/ abstracts from January 2015 up to and including July 2021, selecting those that included &#8805; 5 patients. Endpoints included rates and differences in CRS and ICANS. Response rates were evaluated. Statistical tests in the pooled data included &#967;2 and multivariable logistic regression.<br \/>Results: This meta-analysis included a total of 1,250 patients [566 patients with solid tumors who had received ACT in phase I, II or I\/II clinical trials; a comparison was made with five phase 2 clinical trials in hematologic malignancies used for the first FDA approvals of these agents (JULIET, ZUMA-1, ZUMA-2, TRANSCEND and KARMMA), encompassing 684 heme malignant patients]. Rates of CRS of any grade, CRS &#8805; grade 3, ICANS of any grade, and ICANS &#8805; grade 3 in solid tumors were 33.0%, 3.8%, 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. Fever, hypotension, and hypoxia were experienced by 37.4%, 18.5%, and 8.5% of solid tumor patients, respectively. CRS, ICANS, fever and hypoxia in solid tumor patients did not differ by whether the ACT received was TCR or CAR T. Objective response (ORR = CR + PR) in patients with solid tumors was higher with TCR compared with CAR-T [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1, P=0.001] and with NY-ESO-1 than other targets (OR=2.0, P=0.031). Compared to hematologic patients treated with ACT, solid tumor patients treated with adoptive cellular therapies were significantly less likely to experience CRS of any grade (62.4% vs. 33.0%, P&#60;0.001), CRS &#8805; grade 3 (7.3% vs. 3.8%, P=0.043), fever (50.3% vs. 37.4%, P=0.001), hypoxia (34.1% vs. 8.5%, P&#60;0.001) or hypotension (29.5% vs. 18.5%, P=0.006), ICANS of any grade (29.7% vs. 2.3%, P&#60;0.001), or ICANS &#8805; grade 3 (13.9% vs. 2.1%, P&#60;0.001). However, objective response (20.1% vs. 75.4%, P&#60;0.001) and clinical benefit (CBR = CR + PR + SD) (62.6 % vs. 90.9%, P&#60;0.001) rates for ACT were lower in patients with solid tumors than in patients with hematologic malignancies.<br \/>Conclusions: CRS and ICANs were less prevalent in solid tumor cellular therapies. Based on this analysis, T-cell therapies in solid tumors are relatively safe, but further studies with larger populations and longer follow up are needed to address the role of these treatments in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1da16453-c3c8-485a-b6ee-c5bcc488aeca\/@s03B8ZBN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Safety,Metastatic tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16573"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mirella Nardo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Y.
