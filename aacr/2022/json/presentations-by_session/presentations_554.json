[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a rare cell population within tumors that possesses self-renewal and tumor initiation capacity, have been implicated in cancer relapse and resistance to chemotherapy. In ovarian cancer (OC), CSCs are characterized by a high expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Understanding the regulatory programs promoting stemness could identify new treatments. We identified FOXK2 as a key transcription factor (TF) that promotes stemness in OC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We generated FOXK2 knockdown OC models by stable transduction of shRNA targeting this TF and measured the population of ALDH+ CSCs, expression of stemness-associated genes, and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor initiation capacities. Transcriptomic and ChIP-seq analyses were used to identify key FOXK2 targets. CRISPR-dCas9 genome editing was used to verify the regulatory function of FOXK2. Rescue experiments validated the roles of a newly discovered target gene of FOXK2.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Through gene expression analyses in CSCs vs. non-CSCs, we identified FOXK2 as a highly expressed stemness-specific TF in OC. Genetic depletion of FOXK2 diminished stemness features and reduced <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor initiation capacity. Through ChIP-sequencing we discovered that FOXK2 directly regulates IRE1&#945; (<i>ERN1<\/i> gene) expression, a key sensor for the unfolded protein response (UPR). ChIP-sequencing analysis further revealed that FOXK2 binds to an intronic regulatory element of ERN1. Blocking FOXK2 from binding to this enhancer by using a CRISPR\/dCas9 diminished IRE1&#945; transcription. At the molecular level, FOXK2-driven upregulation of IRE1&#945; led to alternative <i>XBP1<\/i> mRNA splicing and activation of stemness pathways, while genetic or pharmacological blockade of IRE1&#945; inhibited CSCs in OC models.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our data establish a new function for FOXK2 as a key transcriptional regulator of CSCs and a mediator of the UPR, providing insight into potentially targetable new pathways in ovarian CSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2daea38c-1ea8-49d8-8665-9b9d2113f1b9\/@u03B8ZTv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cell,Transcription factor,Ovarian cancer,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17983"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yaqi Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yinu Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangyuan Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edward J.

Identifying new effective therapeutic targets is of great significance for the management of HCC. Cumulative evidence suggests cancer stem cells (CSCs) are key drivers of tumor growth and heterogeneity. Post-transcriptional RNA editing of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) catalyzed by ADAR1 dramatically alters cellular transcriptome in cancers. However, ADAR1 editase-dependent mechanisms governing hepatic CSC generation have not been elucidated. Therefore, we have systematically and comprehensively investigated ADAR1&#8217;s effect on CSC self-renewal in HCC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> An <i>in vitro<\/i> human hepatocyte differentiation model along with relevant transcriptomic data form GEO and TCGA were analyzed to characterize the oncofetal role of ADAR1. Using genetic approaches, RNA sequencing was performed to identify putative ADAR1-mediated recoding edited genes in HCC cell lines. Clinical implication of <i>GLI1<\/i> editing was studied in a cohort of 88 HCC patients. <i>GLI1 <\/i>editing-mediated change in its promoter activity and protein stability was investigated by dual reporter assay, CHIP, Co-IP, and PLA assays. Functional difference in stemness properties, including abilities of self-renewal, differentiation, tumorigenesis, chemo-resistance and metastasis between wild-type and edited <i>GLI1<\/i> (GLI1<sup>wt<\/sup> <i>vs. <\/i>GLI1<sup>R701G<\/sup>) and the exact mechanisms were also studied in cell models and mice.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Lentiviral ADAR1 wild-type but not editing-defective ADAR1<sup>E912A<\/sup> mutant, editing at nt2101 of <i>GLI1 <\/i>transcript caused arginine-to-glycine substitution at the residue 701. Importantly, increased editing of <i>GLI1<\/i> was implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC. Upon editing, C-terminal half of GLI1 harbored a lower susceptibility to the inhibition of SUFU, thus promoting its nuclear translocation and activation. Moreover, GLI1<sup>R701G<\/sup> appeared more stable than GLI1<sup>wt<\/sup> due to reduced formation of specific K63-GLI1 substrate and<i> &#946;<\/i>-TrCP-GLI1 complex. Edited GLI1 was found to strongly enhance targeted activation of <i>NANOG<\/i> and <i>SOX9<\/i>, resulting in accumulation of hepatic CSCs population, hepatocarcinogenesis, sorafenib-resistance and metastasis. Additionally, <i>GLI1<\/i> editing initiated mitophagy via PINK1\/Parkin-dependent pathway. Impaired mitophagy effectively antagonized the functions of GLI1<sup>R701G<\/sup> on hepatic CSC self-renewal and overcome chemoresistance.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The critical advance of this study is that ADAR1 editase activity drives GLI1-dependent maintenance of the hepatic CSC population. Our discovery of a pivotal ADAR1-GLI1-PINK1 self-renewal axis provides the first mechanistic link between RNA-editing-driven malignant progression and mitochondrial homeostasis. Thus, ADAR1 represents a unique therapeutic vulnerability in liver CSCs with active mitophagy mediated by edited GLI1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aad5be76-6e0b-453e-853d-fb0db2fd8027\/@u03B8ZTv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,RNA editing,Stemness,Mitophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17984"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"65b42600-f8f5-44ae-af77-8a1d160dccfa","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/65b42600-f8f5-44ae-af77-8a1d160dccfa\/@u03B8ZTv\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jie Luo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lanqi Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuma Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiao Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaona Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baifeng Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beilei Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Ho-Fun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin-Yuan Guan<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the characteristics of CSCs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still elusive. Our previous in vitro hepatocyte differentiation model revealed that the expression of anti-silencing function 1B histone chaperone (ASF1B) was remarkably upregulated in the stem cell-like stages. In HCC patients, ASF1B was highly expressed in cancer tissues compared with normal counterparts and was positively correlated with poor survival. Functional assays indicated that ASF1B could considerably promote the self-renewal, growth, and metastasis of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ASF1B could directly bind to histone H3 Variant H3.3 and enhance its incorporation into the promoter regions of certain stemness- and metastasis-associated genes including SOX9, KLF4, and TBX3, contributing to their augmented transcriptional and protein expression levels. H3.3 knock-down decreased the expression of these stemness and metastasis-associated genes, eliminating the stemness and oncogenic properties of ASF1B. Overall, our study revealed that ASF1B could facilitate HCC stemness and progression via H3.3-dependent transcriptional reprogramming. ASF1B might be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/80793908-bd21-4438-be30-b60cefe48ffc\/@u03B8ZTv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stemness,Metastasis,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17985"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaona Fang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beilei Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lanqi Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyuan Guan<\/i><\/presenter>.

The marker genes used to identify CSCs in CRC and transcriptional state of these cell is not fully elucidated due to the plasticity and dynamic nature of CSCs. In this study, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on primary CRC and liver metastases from CRC to evaluate the CSC population. We profiled approximately 80,000 single cells from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) treated patients generated using 10X Chromium scRNA-seq and Illumina platforms. A total of 16 samples were analyzed (5 colon tumor, 3 colon matched normal, 3 liver metastasis, 5 liver matched normal), 4 samples failed quality control and were excluded. Following extensive quality control and batch effect correction, we performed dimensionality reduction and differential expression analysis with Seurat v3.0 and custom R packages. We used a set of 11 canonical colon CSC marker genes (CD44, PROM1, LGR5, LRIG1, ASCL2, EPHB2, OLFM4, AXIN2, SLC12A2, RNF43, LEFTY1) as CSCs signature to score the stemness of each cell by AddModuleScore. Established marker genes were used to identify cell type assignment including stem\/TA, immature enterocytes, immature secretory, enterocytes, Best4 enterocytes, goblet, tuff, CD4, CD8, Treg, NK, B, plasma, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelium, glia, pericytes and hepatocytes. In the 16,703 epithelial cells, the CSC signature genes were diffusely expressed in stem\/TA and immature epithelium but not in a specific cell cluster. There was minimal overlap in expression of the 11 CSC marker genes at the single-cell level. By clustering the CSCs identified by high CSC signature score, we found CSCs grouped distinctly by patients, indicating significant patient to patient variability. Furthermore, CSCs did not cluster by positivity for any specific marker gene, suggesting that marker genes may just be markers, and do not define distinct transcriptional states. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed intestinal stemness was significantly enriched (FDR &#60; 0.01) in CSCs compared with non-CSCs. Comparing CSCs to stem cells from normal samples, suppression of the fatty acid metabolism pathway was the only common feature seen in CSCs from each tumor. The heterogeneity of CSC marker genes in CRC tumor cells suggests that defining CSCs by single or few marker genes is inadequate. GSEA verified that a CSC scoring system aggregating expression of 11 canonical colon CSC marker genes can identify CSCs from scRNA-seq. There is marked transcriptional heterogeneity in CSCs, with few common features from CSCs from different tumors. It is hoped that future study of how the diversity of CSCs states evolve under chemotherapy will shed light on overcoming chemo-resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ebcf4c76-b3fa-420b-9d5a-97019611dc34\/@u03B8ZTv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Single cell,Colorectal cancer,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17986"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kangyu Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Paul Shen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC) results from the acquisition of mutations in a colonic stem cell which transforms it into a cancer stem cell (CSC). There are no curative treatments for advanced CRC due to the resistance of CSCs to chemotherapy and\/or radiation. All-<i>trans <\/i>retinoic acid (ATRA) is known to be a greatly effective treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) which is caused by translocation in the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene. We conjecture that the response of retinoic acid (RA) agents may have effects on solid tumors depending on their pathway genotype. Results from our bioinformatics analysis on mutations and overexpression of RA signaling component genes in CRC showed that the majority of RA pathway genes are overexpressed in CRC. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ability of retinoid and retinoid metabolism blocking agents to induce differentiating effects in CSCs depends on the RA pathway genotype expressed in CRC cells.<br \/>Methods: The ability of RA agents (ATRA, 13-<i>cis<\/i> retinoic acid, 9-<i>cis<\/i> retinoic acid) and RA metabolism blocking agents (Liarozole and Talarozole) to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation on CRC cell lines with different mutations in RA signaling were evaluated. Additionally, Nanostring Profiling was used to measure the effects of the agents on mRNA expression of CSC markers, indicators of cell differentiation, and RA receptors.<br \/>Results: Our results show that the RA pathway genotype affects the response of RA agents in CRC cell lines. Both HCT116 and SW480 CRC cell lines, which are both mutant in RARA and RARA and RXRG respectively displayed resistance to ATRA. HT29 CRC cells express wild- type RA receptors and are sensitive to ATRA. All three cell lines showed similar dose responses to the CYP26A1 inhibitor Liarozole. This indicates that regardless of RA receptor mutations, inhibition of ATRA metabolism increases intracellular RA levels in a similar manner on all 3 cell lines. Nanostring Profiling shows that ATRA treatment of HT29 cells induces: an increase in the expression of RARA, CYP26A1 (ATRA metabolizing enzyme) and KRT20 (differentiation marker); and a decrease in the expression of CSC markers LGR5 and ALDH1A1. This indicates an active RA signaling pathway, induced differentiation, and a decrease in stem cells.<br \/>Discussion: Overall, our findings indicate that colon SCs are regulated by RA signaling mechanisms and dysregulation of RA signaling contributes to the SC overpopulation that drives CRC growth. Therefore, further investigation on how to therapeutically sensitize human colonic CSCs to the differentiation-inducing effects of retinoid agents should provide insight into designing new SC-targeted therapies for CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/34f14804-6289-4e2b-8cd9-4b091626717f\/@u03B8ZTv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Retinoids,Cancer stem cells,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17987"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Victoria O.

Herein, we investigated how to target the link between these two pathways to restore proper WNT and RA signaling, and promote differentiation of CSCs along the neuroendocrine cell (NEC) lineage. Accordingly, we conducted <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments to determine if restoring <i>wt<\/i>-<i>APC <\/i>in <i>APC<\/i>-mutant CRC cells reduces Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling, increases sensitivity to retinoids, reduces cell proliferation, reduces expression of stem cell markers, reduces the number of ALDH+ cells, and enhances NEC maturation. We utilized Nanostring profiling, TCF reporter assay, western blot, and fluorescence activated cell sorting analyses to ascertain the effects of restoring WNT in HT29 CRC cells. We found that induction of <i>wt-APC<\/i> expression decreased WNT\/&#946;-catenin signaling and reduced protein expression of WNT-target genes. Notably, inducing <i>wt-APC<\/i> decreased ATRA-induced expression of the WNT target gene CYP26A1 (by 50%), which is predicted to increase RA signaling by lowering the degradation of RA. Indeed, w<i>t-APC<\/i> increased sensitivity of CRC cells to ATRA-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of ALDH1A1 decreased 3-fold by ATRA treatment and inducing <i>wt-APC<\/i> furthered the decrease by an additional 2-fold. Furthermore, we found an increase in the protein expression of several NEC markers including CHGA, GLP2R, NSE (ENO2), and SSTR1, and an increased number of GLP2R+ NECs upon inducing <i>wt-APC<\/i>. Thus, the link between WNT and RA signaling at the level of CYP26A1, provides a mechanism that can explain how mutant <i>APC<\/i> leads to decreased maturation of ALDH+ SCs along the NEC lineage and an increased number of ALDH+ SCs. Therefore, discovering ways to increase differentiation of SCs along the NEC lineage <i>in vivo<\/i> might lead to new more effective treatment strategies involving retinoids for CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/44b48c4e-74c2-45cd-8fb3-05931cb84314\/@v03B8ZTw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Colorectal cancer,Retinoids,Wnt signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17988"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caroline O.

SC overpopulation drives colorectal cancer (CRC) development, which is also linked with the aberrant expression of specific HOX genes. One such gene is HOXA9. Our <i><u>goal<\/u><\/i> is to find out how HOXA9-regulatory mechanisms play a role in the SC origin of CRC. Previous research in our lab reported that HOXA9 as well as other HOX proteins (e.g. HOXA4 &#38; HOXD10) are selectively expressed in human colonic cancer SCs (CSCs). The SC marker aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and other retinoic acid (RA) pathway components are also selectively expressed in CSCs. Moreover, HOXA9 expression is positively correlated with expression of ALDH genes such <i>as ALDH1A1. These findings suggest that RA signaling regulates HOXA9 gene expression in colonic ALDH+ SCs. <\/i><br \/>Hypothesis: Dysregulated HOXA9 expression leads to ALDH+ SC overpopulation, which contributes to CRC growth and development. We used immunofluorescent (IF) mapping to determine the histologic location of HOXA9+ cells in relation to colonic SCs and other differentiated colonic cell types in normal and neoplastic human colonic tissues. We also measured the effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and the ALDH enzyme inhibitor diethylamino benzaldehyde (DEAB) on HOXA9 expression, cell proliferation and differentiation using CRC cell lines. Immunofluorescence mapping indicated that not only is HOXA9 selectively expressed in ALDH-positive SCs, but that HOXA9 expression is increased in colon carcinoma tissue compared to normal colon epithelium. Our results also showed that both ATRA and DEAB treatment decreased the proliferation of HT29 and SW480 CRC cell lines. Western blot analysis showed that HOXA9 has reduced expression in ATRA-treated HT29 CRC cells. Additionally, our independent bioinformatics analyses show that HOXA9 is predominantly expressed in both stem cells and neuroendocrine cells (NECs) in normal human colonic epithelium. Taken together, these findings indicate that regulation of HOXA9 gene expression by RA signaling controls differentiation of ALDH+ SCs along the NEC lineage in human colon tissue. Thus, our results show that HOXA9 is regulated by RA signaling and when dysregulated, contributes to CRC development and growth. These findings provide a mechanism that may be targeted in the design of novel treatments against SC overpopulation in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/15509d16-0f2c-4b2e-9f45-b2214819ac31\/@v03B8ZTw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Retinoids,Cancer stem cells,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17989"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian T.

Repeated dosing of NK cells can partly compensate the relatively shorter persistence of NK cells compared with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T); However, with each repeat, the persistence and efficacy are increasingly challenged by activation of host innate and adaptive immunity. Thus, reducing immunogenicity of allogeneic NK cells holds promise for better efficacy. In this study, we report a combination of &#8220;hypoimmunity&#8221; gene edits including multiple transgene knock-ins and both class I and class II MHC knockouts (2KO). We show that hiPSC engineered by the hypoimmunity combo can be efficiently differentiated into NK cells, comparable to the non-engineered ones. This is contrary to the notion from mouse studies that NK cells devoid of class I molecules are hypo-responsive, these engineered NK cells can be expanded by aAPC (artifitial Antigen Presenting Cells, a K562 cell line with surface expression of mbIL-21 and CD137L) and are capable of killing tumor cells, Additionally, we show that the engineered NK cells can evade T cell immunity, as examined by in vitro T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. A humanized mouse model with transplanted CD34-positive human hematopoietic stem cells confirmed that the engineered NK cells can persist longer than WT and 2KO NK cells. Hypoimmune-QN-019 NK cells are generated by incorporating hypoimmunity gene combo edits into our hiPSC-derived NK cell clinical candidate QN-019 which has 3 transgenes including membrane-bound IL-15, high affinity non-cleavable CD16 and CAR targeting CD19. Comparing to QN-019, hypoimmune-QN-019 displayed better efficacy in humanized CDX mouse model in clearing CD19-positive cancer cells. Taken together, we have engineered hiPSC-derived allogeneic NK cells with hypoimmunity features, which hold great promise in becoming an off-the-shelf drug with improved in vivo persistence and efficacy for repeated dosing.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a423f76-0b70-44bb-a011-fce813169a05\/@v03B8ZTw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-05 Stem cells and regenerative medicine in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,CAR-NK,Hypoimmunity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17990"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jiabiao Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangjun He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yixuan Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanan Yue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangbin Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Church<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Luhan Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

EAC arises in the setting of Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, which is an intestinal metaplastic precursor lesion that develops from chronic reflux of gastrointestinal contents (especially acidic bile salts). Here we report that NOTCH signaling is activated in the esophagus through a unique pathway during exposure to acidic bile salts and progression to EAC. Using a combination of public databases, EAC cell line models, transgenic mice, and patient tissue samples, we detected significant upregulation of several NOTCH signaling components in EAC. Activated NOTCH signaling was confirmed by nuclear accumulation of NOTCH1 cleaved fragment (NICD) with corresponding up-regulation of NOTCH targets in EAC cells in response to acidic bile salts. Moreover, we identified DLL1 as the predominant ligand contributing NOTCH1 activation. Remarkably, DLL1 was regulated by direct cross talk between redox and inflammatory pathways that are activated during both reflux and malignant transformation. Mechanistically, the APE1 redox function transcriptionally up-regulated NF-&#954;B in response to bile salts. This licensed NF-&#954;B to transcriptionally up-regulate DLL1 to activate and stimulate downstream NOTCH1 signaling, thereby defining a novel APE1-NF-kB-NOTCH pro-tumorigenic pathway. This pathway was important for maintaining tumor initiating (cancer &#8220;stem cell-like&#8221;) properties in vitro, recurrently detected in genetically engineered mouse models of EAC and in EAC patient samples in vivo, and portended an overall poor prognosis. Collectively, these findings indicate that progression from chronic injury to malignancy in the esophagus is driven by a unique mechanism that links redox balance, inflammation, embryonic development (NOTCH) together into a common pro-tumorigenic pathway that is intrinsic to EAC cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79929d61-3db2-4e47-bf01-f72d72dce5e6\/@v03B8ZTw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-03 Developmental pathways in cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,NF-&#954;B,APE1,DLL1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18383"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Heng Lu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dunfa Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Longlong Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zheng Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajaz Bhat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Zaika<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shutian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wael El-Rifai<\/i><\/presenter>.

These cells have self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential and contribute to multiple tumor malignancies, such as recurrence, metastasis, heterogeneity, multidrug resistance, and radiation resistance. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) was recently identified as CSC marker is upregulated in several solid tumors, which distinguishes between cancer and normal stem cell. However, the role of DCLK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. According to the open database like TCGA, overexpression of DCLK1 is reported to be associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. It was also observed that DCLK1 expression was significantly increased in the advanced stage of HCC. In addition, as a result of measuring the serum DCLK1 levels obtained from patients with liver cirrhosis or HCC treated at Seoul National University Hospital, it was confirmed that the expression of DCLK1 was significantly increased in patients with HCC compared to those with liver cirrhosis. It was also confirmed that DCLK1 was expressed in human HCC cell lines and that the expression levels of DCLK1 mRNA and protein were further increased in CSC rich human HCC cell lines. Moreover, cell death was increased at the cellular level when DCLK1 was blocked via inhibiting expression of CSC markers such as CD133 and EpCAM. After evaluating the effect of DCLK1 inhibition in CSC rich human HCC cells lines, it was found that spheroid formation decreased by suppressing CSCs markers including LGR5 and CD133. In addition, it was confirmed that cell migration decreased when DCLK1 was blocked. Even in the murine HCC model, it was found that the antitumor effect was showed when administered with DCLK1 inhibitor, DCLK1-IN-1, in xenograft model with CSC rich HCC cell lines. Our results support that DCLK1 can be used as a biomarker for the detection of HCC and may be a candidate for developing targeted therapeutics to eradicate HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bff3af46-3f6b-41a3-b05b-b75aa31362d3\/@v03B8ZTw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DCLK1,Cancer stem cells,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Cancer stem cell marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18899"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daseul Yoon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Hee Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ju Young Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Young Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Jin Jo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donghyun Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-kyu Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Su Jong Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

The Notch pathway is evolutionarily conserved, is active in uterine processes, has oncogenic properties in many cancers, but has not been well studied in uLMS. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are subpopulations of cancer cells that are treatment resistant. In certain tumors, activation of canonical Notch signaling, via gamma secretase, supports CSC survival and the acquisition of chemoresistance. Our objective is to identify and characterize the subpopulation of uLMS cells that are viable after treatment with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) of MK-0752, a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) in phase I trials. We will determine Notch signaling activity and expression of markers associated with stem-like potential in GSI resistant uLMS cells.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>MTT assays were performed on SK-LMS-1 and SK-UT-1B, two uLMS cell lines, to identify the IC<sub>50 <\/sub>for MK-0752. Cells were exposed to MK-0752 at the IC<sub>50<\/sub> or DMSO (control) for 24 hours and viable cells were collected. First, expression of stemness markers, <i>CD133<\/i>, c<i>MYC <\/i>and <i>SOX2<\/i>, in uLMS cells was compared to human uterine smooth muscle cells (hUT-SMC) at baseline. After treatment with MK-0752, the remaining subpopulations of resistant uLMS cells were evaluated for Notch signaling activity by expression of <i>HES1. <\/i>Stemness marker expression was also assessed. Gene expression was measured with qRT-PCR. Mean fold change (FC) gene expression was determined by FC experimental divided by FC control, relative to expression of 18S rRNA. P&#8804;0.05 was considered significant.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In untreated uLMS cells, expression of <i>CD133<\/i> and <i>c-MYC<\/i> was significantly higher in SK-LMS-1 (fibroblast morphology) vs hUT-SMC, while expression of <i>CD133<\/i> and <i>SOX2<\/i> was significantly higher in SK-UT-1B (epithelial morphology) vs hUT-SMC. After treatment with MK-0752 at IC<sub>50<\/sub> (427.4 &#181;M for SK-LMS-1 or 128.4&#181;M for SK-UT-1B) expression of <i>HES1<\/i> was decreased in SK-LMS-1 (0.35x, p&#8804;0.05)<sub> <\/sub>and increased in SK-UT-1B (2.38x, p&#8804;0.01) in treatment resistant, viable cells as compared to untreated cells. Expression of <i>c-MYC<\/i> was decreased (0.38x, p&#8804;0.01) and <i>CD133<\/i> was similar (1.64x, p&#62;0.05) in GSI resistant SK-LMS-1 cells, while expression of <i>CD133<\/i> and <i>SOX2 <\/i>was similar (1.43x and 1.30x, respectively, p&#62;0.05) in GSI resistant SK-UT-1B cells compared to untreated cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Cellular morphology, Notch signaling activity and expression of stemness markers differs in GSI resistant SK-LMS-1 compared to GSI resistant SK-UT-1B cells. The subpopulation of MK-0752 resistant SK-LMS-1 cells have reduced Notch activity and reduced expression of stemness marker, <i>c-MYC<\/i>, while the resistant SK-UT-1B cells have increased Notch activity.

Here, we report an iPSC-derived therapeutic strategy targeting B-Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) to overcome exhaustion of antigen-specific CTL and revitalize them to fully functional antigen-specific memory T cells to target multiple myeloma (MM). First, we established the iPSC by reprogramming IFN-&#947; producing heteroclitic BCMA<sub>72-80 <\/sub>(<b><u>Y<\/u><\/b>LMFLLRKI) peptide-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CTL via Sendai virus transduction of transcription factors, OCT3\/4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. The BCMA-specific iPSC demonstrated high pluripotency potential and ability to differentiate into three key germ layers, as evidenced by expression of stem cell markers (SSEA-4, TRA1-60), germ differentiation markers (SOX-17 on Endoderm, Brachyury on Mesoderm, and Pax-6 on Ectoderm) and alkaline phosphatase. The polarization of iPSC was followed during embryoid body formation into mesoderm development, evidenced by activation of transcriptional regulators SNAI2, TBX3, PLVAP, HAND1 and CDX2. Furthermore, hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC; CD34<sup>+<\/sup> CD43<sup>+<\/sup> \/ CD14<sup>- <\/sup>CD235a<sup>-<\/sup>) were sorted and induced to undergo T cell development under feeder-free culture conditions in the presence of rectonectin. Upon differentiation, phenotypic characterization revealed fully mature T cells with high expression (&#62; 95%) of CD3, CD45, TCR&#945;&#946; and CD8&#945;&#946;, which were predominantly CD45RO<sup>+ <\/sup>memory T cells with high activation (CD38) and costimulatory (CD28) molecule expression, while lacking immune checkpoints (CTLA4, PD1, LAG3, Tim3). This phenotype was aligned with their high proliferative (1,800-fold increase) capacity and effective anti-tumor cytotoxicity and Th1 cytokine (IFN-&#947;, IL-2, TNF-&#945;) production against MM patients&#8217; tumor cells in antigen-specific and HLA-A2-restricted manner. Their anti-MM activities were specifically directed against the parent heteroclitic BCMA<sub>72-80 <\/sub>peptide via a distinct sole T cell receptor clonotype. RNAseq analyses identified specific transcriptional pathways utilized by BCMA-specific HPC during their differentiation into CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CTL, which include upregulation of transcriptional regulators determining CD4\/CD8 T cell differentiation ratio, memory CTL formation, NF-kappa-B\/JNK pathway activation, as well as downregulation of regulators controlling B and T cell interactions or CD4<sup>+<\/sup> Th cells and inhibitory receptor development. In summary, these results highlight the processes and pathways mediating somatic T cell epigenetic reprogramming and differentiation into rejuvenated BCMA-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CTL with high proliferation and functional anti-MM activities, providing the framework for regenerative medicine as an adoptive immunotherapy to improve patient outcome in MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5415051c-44fc-42f1-a60b-27369030035f\/@v03B8ZTw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-05 Stem cells and regenerative medicine in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Targeted therapy,Stem cells,Differential gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21413"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jooeun Bae<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuichi Kitayama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zach Herbert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurence Daheron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikhil Munshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shin Kaneko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jerome Ritz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>.

The dichotomous division pattern of the CSCs sitting atop the tumor hierarchy allow them to self-renew, and differentiate to initiate and repopulate aggressive tumors. These CSC-differentiation-derived bulk tumor cells reprogram to stem-like states, accounting for high plasticity within a tumor; a phenomenon governed by the distinct epigenetic profiles of the two cell populations. Reciprocal signaling between the tumor and its complex microenvironment is a vital driver of plasticity and heterogeneity in cancer. The indispensable role of CSCs in cellular cross-talk in the tumor niche as critical drivers of tumorigenesis is well-studied. However, the massive outnumbering of the CSCs by the differentiated cells raises several vital questions regarding the role of the latter in tumor growth; whether they contribute to the complex signaling within the tumor microenvironment (TME) to drive tumor growth remains unexplored. In this study, we aimed to mechanistically delineate the distinct roles of the cancer stem-like and differentiated cells by investigating their interactions with other stromal cells in the TME.In our model system, Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive brain cancer, we adopted a quantitative, label-free, high-throughput proteomics-based approach to identify the differentially abundant secreted proteins between the glioma stem-like cell (GSC) and differentiated glioma cell (DGC). This analysis showed a significantly higher abundance of the Fibromodulin (FMOD), a collagen-binding proteoglycan, in the conditioned medium of the DGCs compared with that of the GSCs. Our investigation revealed that an activated TGF-&#946; signaling leads to p-SMAD2 occupancy on the FMOD promoter region, leading to increased FMOD secretion by the DGCs. DGCs silenced for FMOD fail to cooperate with co-implanted GSCs to promote tumor growth in a subcutaneous mouse model. We also observed that FMOD downregulation neither affects GSC growth and differentiation nor DGC growth and reprogramming <i>in vitro<\/i>. Moreover, DGC-secreted FMOD activates integrin-dependent Notch signaling in endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis. FMOD-silencing also inhibits the capability of the transdifferentiated endothelial cells (derived from the DGCs) to form angiogenic networks. Conditional silencing of FMOD in the <i>de novo<\/i> formed DGCs in an orthotopic intracranial<i> <\/i>C57BL\/6 mouse model<i> <\/i>inhibited the growth of GSC-initiated tumors due to poorly developed vasculature, thereby increasing mouse survival. The same observation was recapitulated using patient-derived GSCs in an immunocompromised intracranial mouse model, thereby highlighting the human relevance of our findings. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how paracrine signaling between DGC-secreted FMOD and the stromal cells promotes tumor growth by enhancing angiogenesis, thereby highlighting a previously less studied supportive role of DGCs in tumor growth, albeit the GSCs retaining the tumor-initiating capacity.

Approximately 50% of CH manifests from <i>DNMT3A <\/i>mutations acquired in the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting these mutations may convey a fitness advantage to HSCs during hematopoietic stress. However, a unifying molecular mechanism to illuminate how <i>DNMT3A<\/i>-mutant HSCs outcompete their counterparts is still lacking. Here, we used interferon-gamma (IFNg) as a model to study the mechanisms by which <i>Dnmt3a <\/i>mutations enhances HSC fitness under recurrent inflammatory stress.<br \/>To represent the spectrum of <i>DNMT3A<\/i> variants found in humans, mouse genetic models were generated by specifically deleting <i>Dnmt3a<\/i> heterozygously (Vav-Cre;<i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>fl\/+<\/sup> = <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>HET<\/sup>) or homozygously (Vav-Cre;<i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> = <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>KO<\/sup>) from the hematopoietic system. A hematopoietic system-specific knockin model analogous to the hotspot point mutation most prevalent in AML (Vav-Cre;<i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>R878H\/+<\/sup> = <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>R878<\/sup>) was also included in the analysis.<br \/>Competitive transplantation assays coupled with inflammatory and proliferative challenges suggested that <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>KO<\/sup> and <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>R878 <\/sup>HSCs were specifically tolerant of the deleterious effects of IFNg on HSC self-renewal and clonal expansion. When the competition between <i>Dnmt3a<\/i>-mutant and control HSCs under IFNg exposure was directly quantified in a novel mouse model, we found <i>Dnmt3a<\/i>-mutant HSCs resisted IFNg-mediated depletion due to an enhanced fitness advantage. Mechanistically, DNA hypomethylation-associated over-expression of <i>Txnip<\/i> in <i>Dnmt3a<\/i>-mutant HSCs was identified by coupling single-cell RNA-sequencing and Whole-Genome Bisulfite sequencing. The sustained <i>Txnip <\/i>levels in <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>KO<\/sup> HSCs lead to p53 stabilization and upregulation of p21 under IFNg challenge, further correlated with a retained quiescence due to a prolonged G0 exit in response to IFNg exposure. Implementing biochemical studies, we observed <i>Txnip<\/i> mediated an enrichment of p53 at p21 promoter under IFNg exposure in <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>KO<\/sup> but not control 32D cells. Knocking down <i>Txnip<\/i> by shRNA normalized p53 occupancy at <i>p21<\/i> promoter and rescued IFNg-associated <i>p21<\/i> upregulation in <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>KO <\/sup>32D cells. Functionally, knocking down <i>Txnip<\/i> and <i>p21<\/i> sensitized <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>KO<\/sup> HSCs to IFNg-induced cell cycle activation <i>ex vivo<\/i>. In vivo, down-regulation of <i>p21 <\/i>had no effect on control HSCs in response to IFNg exposure, but it completely primed <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>KO<\/sup> and <i>Dnmt3a<\/i><sup>R878<\/sup> HSCs to IFNg-associated exhaustion in a transplantation experiment.<br \/>In summary, our data suggest an augmented <i>Txnip-p53-p21<\/i> axis preserves the functional potential of <i>Dnmt3a<\/i>-mutant HSCs under inflammatory stress, which highlights a novel mechanism to explain the increased fitness of <i>Dnmt3a<\/i>-mutant HSCs and supports rationale for developing interventions to mitigate expansion of pre-malignant clones as a method of blood cancer prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95fe098a-215b-4593-bf7d-71bbf9d1a161\/@v03B8ZTw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Adult stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methyltransferase,Self-renewal,Inflammation,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20142"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christine R.

To elucidate the cells that escape from treatment and form recurrences and metastases, the gene expression landscape, and drug susceptibility were explored using patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Drug sensitivities of 16 PDOs including eight PDOs derived from patients with distant metastases were evaluated.<i> t<\/i>-SNE analysis clearly showed four clusters, including two clusters based on response to therapy (good and poor). RNA sequence analysis showed that poor-response PDOs were enriched in gene sets related to distant metastasis, recurrence, and treatment resistance compared with good-response PDOs. Expression of nine genes (<i>CBS, E2F8, GCNT1, NETO2, PLPP5, POU5F1, XRCC2, RECQL4, <\/i>and <i>ZNF681<\/i>) were characteristic in the poor-response PDOs. Among them, we focused on POU5F1 gene that characterized liver metastasis in CRC from our previous report. Further analysis revealed that POU5F1-positive cells survive after anticancer drug treatment, and they were produced from POU5F1-expressing cells, not POU5F1-negative cells. Notably, isolated single POU5F1-expressing cell produced a heterogeneous population of cells expressing various differentiation markers both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo. <\/i>Single POU5F1-expressing cell also reconstructed ductal structure with mucus-producing ability. Cells produced from POU5F1-expressing cells were thought to construct tumor diversity remaining various differentiation stage. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to reveal the heterogeneous population with treatment resistance. The seven characteristic clusters were identified and the number of cells in clusters 2, 4, and 6 increased at the time of tumor re-growth after anticancer drug treatment. Cluster 2 was characterized by cell-cycle score. When cluster 4 was set as the root of the proliferative trajectory, the trajectory of cluster 4&#8594;3&#8594;6 emerged with characteristic gene expression profiles. The Wnt signaling pathway was enriched in cluster 4, suggesting stem cell characteristics. Moreover, Glycolysis, HIF-1 signaling, and ferroptosis pathways, which are also reported as properties of persister cells were enriched in cluster 6. Herein, we report the features derived from single-cell RNA seq analysis and further examinations in vitro, in vivo, and in clinical specimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/48c42d99-1920-42cf-a5a1-4b6cad7adbac\/@w03B8ZTx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer cell,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21750"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shiki Fujino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aya Ito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masayoshi Yasui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chu Matsuda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masayuki Ohue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masafumi Horie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shinichi Yachida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuichiro Doki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hidetoshi Eguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norikatsu Miyoshi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have revolutionized the treatment for CML, withdrawal of TKI therapy in patients on deep molecular response causes disease relapse, primarily due to the persistence of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that are insensitive to TKI. As LSCs are a rare population of cells, it is challenging to understand the molecular basis of the disease relapse to tailor strategies to eliminate them selectively. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from primary CML are increasingly used for disease modeling and high through drug screening. Cryopreserved CD34+ from three chronic phase CML patients (n=3) and CD34+ cells from a normal donor after mobilization were expanded in SFEM II supplemented with CD34+ Expansion Supplement (10X) including UM729 for 3-days and were nucleofected with episomal reprogramming plasmids as described previously (Manian et al., 2018). The nucleofection efficiency was 15% in the expanded CD34+ CML and normal cells. While the normal CD34+ cells formed iPSCs with the characteristic flat morphology between 20-24 days, the CML CD34+ cells formed several dome-shaped colonies after 30 days. Two normal CD34+ iPSC colonies continued to maintain their morphology for 12 passages. All the CML iPSC colonies (n=11) expressed the same type of BCR-ABL1 transcript as the CD34+ cells and did not carry any mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain. However, only three of the 11 CML-iPSC colonies could be maintained without significant differentiation after five passages. They lacked typical iPSC morphology and appeared as small cell aggregates or dome-shaped colonies. To understand whether this atypical morphology of the CML iPSC colonies was due to the expression of the BCR-ABL fusion protein within the cells, the medium was supplemented with 10&#956;M imatinib. There was an increase in cell proliferation rate and gain of typical iPSCs morphology similar to normal iPSCs within two days after adding IM. Withdrawal of IM from the IM-treated CML iPSC resulted in a dome-shaped morphology, reduced proliferation rate, and reduction in TRA1-60 expression after 96 hrs. The CML iPSC cultured in the presence of IM showed significant downregulation of phospho-CRKL, a BCR-ABL1 downstream signaling protein, compared to the colonies cultured in the absence of IM. These results suggest that suppression of BCR-ABL1 by treatment with IM produced stable CML iPSC-like phenotype while IM withdrawal resulted in dome-shaped colonies and pushed the cells towards differentiation. This proof-of-concept study identified a unique CML LSCs mimetic model. It would serve as an excellent platform for screening small molecules to eliminate LSCs as it thrives on TKI therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a2910645-b6e8-4045-b2de-e06b7f95956b\/@w03B8ZTx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-05 Stem cells and regenerative medicine in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: chronic myelogenous,Stem cells,Drug resistance,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21764"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Esther Sathya Bama Benjamin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaurav Joshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bharathi Murugan Rajamani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krittika Nandy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaji R.
