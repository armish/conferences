[{"Abstract":"Background: Hypermutant gliomas in children are caused by inherited or therapy related replication repair deficiency (RRD), the latter typically following treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) revealed clinical responses and prolonged survival in 30% of pediatric-inherited hypermutant gliomas but none of the treatment-related adult hypermutant gliomas. We hypothesized that high-throughput screening of hypermutant and RRD patient derived glioma cell lines from both glioma types (PDGCL) would reveal specific molecular vulnerabilities immediately translatable as targeted therapies to be used in combination with ICIs.<br \/>Methods: We screened two pediatric hypermutant and RRD PDGCLs (1806, 1260); one pediatric non-hypermutant non-RRD PDGCL (477); an adult non-hypermutant non-RRD PDGCL (189EW); matched recurrent post-TMZ treatment hypermutant RRD PDGCL (248z, 248xy) from patient 189 against a library of 3336 bioactive compounds, including 1500 FDA approved drugs supplemented with 16 additional compounds (BET, PLK1, EZH2, PARP1 inhibitors) at 100nM.Each plate screened contained negative (0.2% DMSO) and positive controls (50nM bortezomib). Cell viability was calculated at 96hr by ATP measurement. Raw values from negative and positive control wells were aggregated and used to calculate Z&#8217;-factors for each assay plate, as a measure of assay performance and data quality, with a Z&#8217;-factor &#62;0.5 representing high quality data. Only drugs scoring Normalized Percentage of Inhibition (NPI) &#62;50% and z-score&#62;3 were considered potential hits for follow-up evaluation, focusing on those enriched in the pediatric and adult hypermutant PDGCLs.<br \/>Results: We identified 45 drugs active in all three of the pediatric PDGCLs and 23 common hits in the adult cell lines. Broad target classes were identified such as microtubule associated inhibitors, heat shock protein inhibitors for PDGCLs and proteasome inhibitors for adult cell lines. Unique targets were also identified. Importantly, the inherited and treatment related mismatch repair deficient glioma cells (MMR1260,248z, 248xy) and the hypermutant pediatric cell line (1806) exhibited significant response to PI3K\/mTOR inhibitors. Ultrahypermutant RRD cell line and the treatment-related hypermutant cell lines (1806 248z 248xy ) displayed sensitivity to topoisomerase I inhibitors. Preliminary <i>in vitro<\/i> data confirm sensitivity to topotecan of hypermutant pediatric and adult cell lines.<br \/>Conclusion: We have identified both mechanism specific and common intrinsic vulnerabilities in hypermutant PDGCLs that can be tested as adjuvant therapies for ICI. Functional validation of the lead candidates is ongoing and will be reported.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09fc6a3c-589b-4e27-9ef6-331d205b59bb\/@B03B8ZXm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma cell lines,Drug sensitivity,Target discovery,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laura Scolaro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nuno Miguel Nunes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Kushida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David C.

EOS-448 (also named GSK4428859A) is an antagonistic anti-TIGIT human immunoglobulin G1 (hIgG1) antibody showing picomolar activity both to prevent ligand binding and to engage Fc gamma receptors (Fc&#947;R).<br \/>EOS-448 was selected based on its potent affinity to TIGIT, translating into strong antagonist and functional activity to restore T cell functions and potent antitumor activity in murine models<sup>2<\/sup>. Building EOS-448 on an isotype allowing to engage Fc&#947;R added potential additional mechanisms of action (MoAs), including the Fc&#947;R-induced activation of myeloid\/NK populations and antibody-mediated depletion of TIGIT high cells.<br \/>To characterize and experimentally validate the multiple MoA triggered by EOS-448, we tested, both in preclinical and clinical settings, its potential to (i) activate effector T cells (ii) modulate antigen-presenting through Fc&#947;R engagement, and (iii) deplete suppressive regulatory T cells and terminally exhausted CD8 T cells that express the highest levels of TIGIT.<br \/>Our results obtained in murine models confirm the strong potential for the a-TIGIT + a-PD1 combination as well as major differences in activity depending on isotype, with only the Fc-engaging format inducing strong antitumor effect correlating with Treg depletion and CD8 T cell activation within the tumor. Similarly, activation markers on DC and antigen-mediated activation were only observed with the Fc-engaging version but totally absent with the Fc-dead format. In addition, we demonstrated, ex-vivo on human samples, that EOS-448 could preferentially deplete Tregs over effector CD8 T cells and progenitor-like exhausted T cells (Tpex) with low effector function over stem-like memory T cells (Tstem) with stronger effector potential<sup>3<\/sup>.<br \/>In a first-in-human trial, EOS-448 demonstrated a good tolerability profile with early signs of efficacy<sup>4<\/sup>. Pharmacodynamic assessment made by flow cytometry in the blood of patients treated across multiple dose levels of EOS-448 confirmed the multiple MoAs triggered by the drug with (i) increased Ki67 expression in memory CD8 T cells during the first treatment cycle, (ii) sustained depletion of suppressive Tregs, and (iii) of TIGIT high CD8+ T cells, known to be terminally exhausted<sup>5<\/sup>, overall resulting in an increased effector CD8\/Treg ratio. This activity also translated into a significant decrease in the detection of TIGIT+ cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC), including FoxP3+ double stained cells, in 21 out of 22 tested paired biopsies, with EOS-448 being the first reported a-TIGIT mAb to engage TIGIT within patient tumor.<br \/>Overall, the preclinical and clinical evaluation demonstrate the multiple MoAs of EOS-448<br \/>supporting its clinical development as a differentiated a-TIGIT mAb to restore anti-tumor immune response.

Regulation of SPI1 expression has also been implicated in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) oncogenesis, though its mechanism is incompletely understood. Previously we have identified and characterized a series of novel dual inhibitors of the SMARCA4\/SMARCA2 ATPases (also referred to as BRG1\/BRM), critical components of the BAF (mSWI\/SNF) family of chromatin remodeling complexes; and FHD-286, a related SMARCA4\/SMARCA2 ATPase inhibitor, is currently being explored clinically for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma and AML (NCT04879017 and NCT04891757). Here we show that AML cell lines are sensitive to BAF ATPase inhibition, resulting in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We demonstrate that BAF ATPase inhibition primarily affects the SPI1 transcriptional profile by regulating SPI1 genomic occupancy at various enhancer elements, resulting in downregulation of key target genes. Using in vivo mouse models of AML, we demonstrate dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and pharmacodynamic modulation of SPI1 target genes. Together, these data suggest that modulation of SPI1 function may, in part, provide a mechanistic basis for the clinical development of FHD-286 in AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/999e48eb-c2e0-4631-9b5a-d321a5b86635\/@B03B8ZXm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,SWI\/SNF,Transcription factor,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gabriel J.

However, its role on the methylation of tumor suppressor genes and DNA damage in relation to antitumor activity of DNMT inhibitors remains controversial. Here, we investigated the effects of DNMT inhibitors in human colorectal and breast cancer cell lines and animal models with intact (DNMT1<sup>+\/+<\/sup>) and disrupted DNMT1 (DNMT1<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) gene. Treatment with 5 &#181;M of 4&#8217;-thio-5-aza-2&#8217;-deoxycytidine (aza-TdC), decitabine and azacytidine all inhibited DNMT1 expression and cell growth (94.0%\/97.1%, 39.9%\/58.6% and 69.2\/91.3), and induced apoptosis (66.9%\/62.5%, 30.9%\/23.8% and 66.2\/43.1%) in DNMT1<sup>+\/+<\/sup> HCT116\/MCF7 cells; in contrast, the DNMT inhibitors had less\/little activities in DNMT1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> HCT116\/MCF7 cells (P&#60;0.001 each). &#947;H2AX and G<sub>2<\/sub>\/M cell-cycle arrest were induced by the inhibitors and greater degree of induction was produced by aza-TdC than decitabine in DNMT1<sup>+\/+ <\/sup>cells (P&#60;0.001), with activation of checkpoint kinase 1 and upregulation of p21. Both demethylation and increased acetylation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B gene promoters together with re-expression of p16INK4A and p15INK4B proteins were detected in DNMT1<sup>-\/- <\/sup>versusDNMT1<sup>+\/+ <\/sup>(demethylation only) cells upon exposure to decitabine for 72h. Compared with saline treatment, tumor growth was significantly inhibited by aza-TdC (90%; n=18 mice) and decitabine (62%; n=18) in DNMT1<sup>+\/+ <\/sup>colorectal xenograft tumors, alongside decreasing expression of DNMT1 (51% and 44%) and an increase in p21 (85% and 48%). Similarly, tumor growth delays (86%; n=15 and 57%; n=14) were associated with the reduction of DNMT1 and augmentation of p21 in bladder PDX tumors. The findings suggest that DNMT inhibitors induce DNA damage and higher anti-tumor activity of aza-TdC is proportional to a greater magnitude of induction of DNA damage, p21 and cell cycle arrest without reactivating the expression of p16INK4A and p15INK4B. The gene re-expression coupled to demethylation and acetylation corresponds to the less anti-tumor activity by decitabine in DNMT1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> cells. Thus, it is the DNA damage effects, rather than re-expression of the tumor suppressors, that are associated with antitumor activity of the DNMT inhibitors in cancer cells and\/or xenograft and PDX tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1103f83c-2fdd-4179-a072-f6331b799bdb\/@B03B8ZXm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methyltransferase,demethylation,DNA damage effect,Antitumor activity of DNMT inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Angelo B.

Recent data has consistently demonstrated co-dependencies of mutant-KRAS with extrinsic proteins that augment GTP-loading. Son of Sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) is the most proximal of these proteins to KRAS and functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the RAS subfamily of small GTPases, thus representing a highly sought-after druggable target. Utilizing a structure-based drug discovery approach, we identified a selective and potent SOS1 inhibitor, MRTX0902, that functions by disrupting the KRAS\/SOS1 protein-protein interaction, ultimately preventing SOS1-mediated nucleotide exchange on KRAS. MRTX0902 enhances the anti-tumor activity of the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor adagrasib across multiple KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-mutant preclinical models; however, it is anticipated that deeper pharmacological inhibition of KRAS signaling may give rise to novel combination targets and additional adaptive resistance mechanisms. To identify additional vulnerabilities and combination strategies, we conducted drug-anchored CRISPR screens in two KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> xenograft models in the presence of MRTX0902 and adagrasib <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Interestingly, we found that the SOS1 homolog, SOS2, only emerges as a co-dependency under selective pressure of combination treatment and likely compensates for the inhibition of SOS1. Furthermore, multiple components from the PIK3CA\/mTOR signaling pathway, PRMT5, and other non-vertical signal transduction pathways were uncovered and identified as genetic co-dependencies that emerged under selective pressure. Conversely, tumor suppressor genes including TSC1\/2, PTEN, NF1, KEAP1 and TP53 along with phosphatases PTPN12 and PTPN14 enhanced tumor growth when knocked out providing a catalogue of putative resistance genes and mechanisms. Lastly, we utilized small molecule inhibitors of putative therapeutic targets identified from our CRISPR screens to validate genetic co-dependencies across <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> translational models. These studies uncover the potential utility of additional drug partners for the MRTX0902 and adagrasib combination and aide in the understanding of SOS and RAS biology in targeted cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/05411288-0e88-4e0e-9ee7-a077beceb05f\/@B03B8ZXm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Son of Sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1),Chemical Genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shilpi Khare<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niranjan Sudhakar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David M.

Alpelisib is a PI3K&#945; isoform-selective, orthosteric kinase inhibitor, having equivalent activity on wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) forms and was approved to treat PI3K&#945; mt, HR+\/HER2- breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant, nearly doubling progression-free survival (Andre 2019). Hyperglycemia with insulin resistance is an on-target result of wt PI3K&#945; inhibition, leading to frequent alpelisib dose reductions, interruptions, and discontinuations. H1047X is the most common PIK3CA alteration, found in ~14% of all breast cancer patients (Mart&#237;nez-S&#225;ez 2020). We considered that selectively targeting this mutant could improve patient outcomes by sparing metabolic dysfunction related to wt inhibition. We have validated this therapeutic concept preclinically with the discovery of ST-814, an allosteric, CNS-penetrant, mutant selective PI3K&#945;<sup>H1047X<\/sup> inhibitor, displaying excellent drug-like properties. ST-814 was 14-fold selective for PI3K&#945;<sup>H1047R<\/sup> vs PI3K&#945;<sup>wt<\/sup> in biochemical assays (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 11 vs 146 nM) with exquisite isoform and kinome selectivity. Cell-based activity and selectivity were characterized in T47D (PI3K&#945;<sup>H1047R<\/sup>) and SKBR3 (PI3K&#945;<sup>WT<\/sup>) tumor cells grown in 10% FBS, with 8-fold mut-selectivity observed in target engagement (pAKT EC<sub>50<\/sub> 38 vs 304 nM) and 11-fold selectivity in viability (GI<sub>50<\/sub> 153 vs 1683 nM). ST-814 has robust anti-tumor activity in PI3K&#945;<sup>H1047X<\/sup> in xenografts, with efficacy similar or superior to alpelisib dosed at 50 mg\/kg (Table 1). To achieve this level of mouse efficacy, alpelisib exposure exceeded that in patients &#62;200% (mouse vs human AUC<sub>0-24<\/sub>, 74,000 vs 33,224 ng*hr\/mL). As such, repeat dosing of alpelisib at 50 mg\/kg, caused profound elevations in serum insulin 1 hr post-dose (*p&#60;0.01), whereas ST-814 showed no significant difference (Table 1). The metabolic consequences of repeated alpelisib (50 mg\/kg) and ST-814 (100 mg\/kg) dosing was further characterized in an insulin tolerance test. Insulin-mediated glucose clearance (AUC<sub>0-4<\/sub>) was significantly impaired by alpelisib (p&#60;0.01, one-way ANOVA), but not by ST-814. These data support the potential of molecules like ST-814 to improve outcomes in patients harboring H1047X mut tumors.

AKT inhibitors that competitively bind the ATP pocket have been evaluated in clinical trials and have a tolerable toxicity profile with greater efficacy for tumors with pathway mutations; however, many PI3K\/AKT pathway mutant tumors remain resistant. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a powerful targeted protein degradation technology that hijacks the cellular ubiquitin-proteasome system to induce selective polyubiquitination and degradation of the target proteins. Using this technology, we designed and developed a library of novel small-molecules putative degraders to degrade AKT by recruiting either the cereblon (CRBN) or von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase, that have the ability to degrade AKT in cells and lower downstream signaling to various extents. Though extensive structure-activity relationship studies on various linkers, E3 ligase ligands, and AKT binding moieties, we identified a novel VHL-recruiting AKT degrader, MS21, and characterized it using a panel of 38 cancer cell lines with diverse genotypes and tissue origins. Our results suggest that efficient pharmacologic degradation of AKT phosphorylated on threonine 308 and serine 473 leads to selective inhibition of the growth of tumor cells with alterations of HER2, PIK3CA, PTEN, or AKT1. In these PI3K\/PTEN pathway mutant lines, AKT degradation by MS21 was superior to AKT kinase inhibition for reducing cell growth and sustaining lower signaling over many days, and inhibited tumor cell growths through lowering the level of Aurora Kinase B, which we found to be an AKT substrate protein. AKT degradation but not kinase inhibition profoundly lowered Aurora kinase B (AURKB) protein, which is known to be essential for cell division, and induced G2\/M arrest and hyperploidy. PI3K activated AKT phosphorylation of AURKB on threonine 73, which protected it from proteasome degradation. A mutant of AURKB (T73E) that mimics phosphorylation and blocks its degradation rescued cells from growth inhibition by MS21. In addition, resistance to MS21 was found to be associated with low levels of baseline AKT phosphorylation in cells as well as mutation of either KRAS or BRAF, and resistance to MS21 could be overcome by the combination treatment of a MEK inhibitor trametinib with MS21, which not only inhibited MEK but also increased AKT phosphorylation and enhanced AKT degradation. Pan-cancer analysis identified that 19% of cases have PI3K\/PTEN pathway mutation without RAS pathway mutation, suggesting that these cancer patients could benefit from AKT degrader therapy that leads to loss of AURKB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9b6f882a-7509-463f-a8c2-6daf55bbbe6c\/@B03B8ZXm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Akt,AURKB,PI3K,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jia Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xufen Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiphaine C.

At present, standard treatment involves surgery and\/or radiation. Complete surgical resection, however, can be challenging as the tumor is located on the skull base or spine. Moreover, there is currently no approved systemic therapy for advanced chordoma. These challenges have resulted in significant morbidity and a dismal cure rate of approximately 30%, highlighting the need for development of new therapeutic strategies for this orphan disease. Emerging evidence suggests a key role for the PI3K\/mTOR pathway in chordoma and numerous reports point to an enrichment of chordoma cases in individuals with tuberous sclerosis syndrome, which is driven by dysregulated mTOR activity. Another study of chordoma tumors from 111 patients demonstrated that the mTOR pathway was activated in 46% of the tumors, and sequencing studies have revealed oncogenic alterations to the PI3K\/mTOR pathway in approximately 15-20% of chordomas. We surmised that dual inhibition of both the mTOR and the PI3K pathways may represent a desirable profile as it will not only have the potential to address the effects of activation of both these targets, but also prevent feedback reactivation of the pathway resulting from the inhibition of one or the other. Previously, SPR965 was shown as a potent, selective and orally bioavailable PI3K and mTOR C1\/C2 inhibitor with an excellent PK\/ADME profile.<br \/>Methods: SPR965 and comparator compounds were evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> in the chordoma cell lines JHC7, U-CH1, and U-CH2 by (Resarufin assay). SPR965 was evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i> in multiple chordoma PDX models.<br \/>Results: SPR965 <i>in vitro<\/i> showed significant effect on cell proliferation with EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 50-90nM. SPR965 was more active at 1uM than PI3K\/mTOR inhibitors VS-5584, Bimiralisib, PF-04691502, WYE-687, Dactolisib, and Voxtalisib in the Kinase Chemogenomic Set. SPR965 <i>in vivo<\/i> monotherapy in SF8894 PDX at 3mg\/kg had similar tumor growth inhibition (TGI) to CDK4\/6 inhibitor Palbociclib at 50mg\/kg. SPR965 combination with Palbocicilib had similar TGI to PI3K inhibitor Buparlisib at 35mg\/kg. In CF459 PDX, SPR965 potently inhibited tumor growth at 10mg\/kg. TGI% was statistically significant with SPR965 versus untreated controls in both models.<br \/>Conclusion: In SF8894 PDX model SPR965 was more efficacious as it produced similar tumor growth inhibition at 12- and 17-fold lower dose than Buparlisib (PI3K) and Palbociclib (CDK4\/6) respectively, both these compounds are in phase 2 clinical trials. In CF459 PDX model SPR965 exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition, and at 10mg\/kg profoundly slowed tumor growth compared to Palbociclib. Studies are underway to elucidate potential mechanisms of SPR965 sensitivity. SPR965 represents a significant opportunity for development of a targeted therapeutic for chordoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1be72a38-8e62-4727-87bb-aca0c18c2717\/@C03B8ZXn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,PI3K,mTOR,Chordoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sundeep Dugar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Somdutta Sen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Paul Maffuid<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Freed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josh Sommer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edward Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Hickey<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, a significant number of patients eventually progress on these therapies. Efforts to overcome therapeutic resistance through combination therapy with small molecule inhibitors of HER2 have been limited by toxicities associated with off-target activity and\/or limited efficacy. In this preclinical study, we explore single-agent and combined activity of tucatinib, a novel HER2-selective small molecule inhibitor. Tucatinib demonstrated potent, selective activity in a panel of 456 human cancer cell lines, with activity restricted to cell lines (breast and non-breast) with HER2-amplification, including models of acquired resistance to trastuzumab. Within the HER2+ population, tucatinib response tracked strongly with HER2-driven signaling. Single agent tucatinib induced tumor regressions in xenograft models of HER2+ breast cancer and combination with trastuzumab induced a complete and sustained blockade of HER2\/PI3K\/AKT-signaling. Efficacy of the tucatinib\/trastuzumab combination matched that induced by current standard of care (SOC) trastuzumab\/pertuzumab\/docetaxel combination, with the exception that the chemotherapy-sparing tucatinib\/trastuzumab combination did not require a dosing holiday to achieve the same efficacy. In xenograft models of HER2+ breast cancer that also express estrogen receptor (ER) (HER2+\/ER+), tucatinib showed combined efficacy with inhibitors of CDK4\/6 and ER, indicating potential novel therapeutic strategies for difficult-to-treat subtypes of HER2+ breast cancer. These data support expanded clinical investigations of tucatinib as a combination partner for other novel and approved targeted therapies for HER2-driven malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/db7b9b82-7bfb-4340-8778-e58837b2ee78\/@C03B8ZXn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6,Herceptin,Palbociclib,Estrogen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Neil A.

Induction of anti-tumor T cells in immunogenic tumors depends on STING, the intracellular innate immune receptor for cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) and related cyclic dinucleotides (CDN). However, the optimal way to leverage STING activation in non-immunogenic tumors is still unclear. Here, we show that cGAMP delivery by intra-tumoral injection of virus-like particles (cGAMP-VLP) leads to differentiation of tumor-specific T cells, decrease in tumor regulatory T cells (Tregs) and anti-tumoral responses that synergize with PD1 blockade. By contrast, intra-tumoral injection of synthetic CDN leads to tumor necrosis and systemic T cell activation but no differentiation of tumor-specific T cells, and a demise of immune cells in injected tumors. Analyses of cytokine responses and genetic models revealed that cGAMP-VLP preferentially targets STING in dendritic cells at a 1000-fold less dose than synthetic CDN. Sub-cutaneous administration of cGAMP-VLP showed synergy when combined with a tumor Treg-depleting antibody to elicit systemic tumor-specific T cells, leading to complete and lasting tumor eradication. These findings show that cell targeting of STING stimulation shapes the anti-tumor T cell response and reveal a therapeutic strategy with T cell modulators, which may address the current limitations of STING-based approaches in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9e65e762-cf34-43c0-8ceb-4d61a2747d4a\/@C03B8ZXn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor effect,Cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bakhos Jneid<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurore Bochnakian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabien Delisle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emeline Djacoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Denizeau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Sedlik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frédéric Fiore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Kramer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Walters<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvain Carlioz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernard Malissen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eliane Piaggio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Manel<\/i><\/presenter>.

Genetically, this tumor is mainly characterized by the recurrent HEY1-NCOA2 fusion. Localized tumor is managed surgically; traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy, however, did not appear to substantially improve the event-free survival rate of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma patients. It is clear that better therapeutic options are needed for the treatment of this tumor. In our previous study, an in vitro model for studying mesenchymal chondrosarcoma tumorigenesis was developed using stably transduced iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPSC-MSCs) with inducible-expression of HEY1-NCOA2. With the in vitro model, we performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-seq to identify HEY1-NCOA2-dependent transcriptional regulation and demonstrated the dramatic activation of PDGF-PDGFR and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways (manuscript in review). Our data also suggested that PDGFB is one of the direct targets of HEY1-NCOA2 fusion protein. In the present study, with the in vitro iPSC-MSC model, we verified that HEY1-NCOA2 fusion protein, but not wild-type HEY1 or NCOA2, dramatically increased phospho-AKT (Ser473, a readout of PI3K) expression by western blotting. Further on, we tested the effect of two kinase inhibitors CP-673451 and PF-04691502, a potent and selective PDGFR inhibitor and the mTOR\/PI3K inhibitor, respectively. Stably transfused iPSC-MSC were treated with the kinase inhibitors, respectively, at different dosages (0.1 &#181;M, 0.5 &#181;M and 1.0 &#181;M) for one week. At the concentration of 1.0 &#181;M, CP-673451 efficiently suppressed AKT phosphorylation by ~23% as well as suppressed cell growth by ~67% which is significantly higher than that observed in the controls (e.g. ~20% suppression in HEY1- and NCOA2- expression iPSC-MSCs). Similarly, at the concentration of 0.5 &#181;M, PF-04691502 suppressed the HEY1-NCOA2-expression iPSC-MSCs growth by ~24% more than that in the control (p=0.02). In summary, both CP-673451 and PF-04691502 were active against the in vitro mesenchymal chondrosarcoma model tested. Based on these data, the&#8239;potential&#8239;benefit of&#8239;targeting PDGF\/PI3K\/AKT signaling pathways&#8239;in the treatment of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma was suggested.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a425fcb-9fe2-4423-b9b0-0dd236c30ee9\/@C03B8ZXn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell proliferation,Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma,PDGF signaling,PI3K-AKT, kinase inhibitor ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wenqing Qi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite the success of systemic Her2-targeted therapies, up to half of patients with Her2+ primary breast cancer develop breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM). Subtype switching from Her2- primary breast tumors account for an additional 15% of Her2+ BCBM, bringing total Her2 positivity in the BCBM setting to nearly 65% of cases. Even though direct delivery of Her2-targeted therapies to the central nervous system (CNS) has shown promising clinical results, long-term feasibility is limited, at least in part, by the need for repeated dosing to overcome the shorter drug half-life in the cerebrospinal fluid vs. systemic circulation (e.g., ~1 vs. 5 days, respectively). To achieve sustained CNS expression of trastuzumab without frequent dosing, we developed a gene therapy approach to treat BCBM comprising a single local administration of AAV vector encoding trastuzumab. Previous work from our group has shown that intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of trastuzumab-expressing AAV doubled the life expectancy of <i>Rag1<\/i> knockout (KO) mice bearing BT-474 breast cancer brain tumors. <i>Rag1<\/i> KO mice who received AAV-trastuzumab prior to implantation of BT-474 tumor cells into the brain showed a dose-dependent delay in tumorigenesis. Following these proof-of-concept studies, we performed extensive gene therapy vector optimization and<i> in vivo<\/i> evaluation. The concentration of trastuzumab achieved in the brain parenchyma after a single ICV administration of the optimized vectors into <i>Rag1<\/i> KO mice ranged from 10-165 ng\/mg of brain protein by day 28. Previous studies utilizing CNS delivery of gene therapy vectors have shown vector leakage into the systemic circulation, which results in detectable transgene expression in the blood following peripheral transduction. To mitigate the potential risk of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, we investigated using intravenously administered, plasma-derived, pooled human immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a source of anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies to reduce peripheral transduction. Compared to controls that received na&#239;ve mouse serum, <i>Rag1<\/i> KO mice receiving IVIG two hours prior to ICV administration of AAV-trastuzumab exhibited similar levels of trastuzumab within the brain while displaying a 10-fold reduction in serum trastuzumab concentrations. Vector biodistribution analysis suggested that reduced serum trastuzumab levels resulted from effective blockade of liver transduction following IVIG pre-treatment. These data suggest that AAV vector administration to the CNS to achieve sustained expression of trastuzumab may effectively treat Her2+ BCBM. Additionally, patients with pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to the AAV vector capsid need not be excluded from future clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1f471964-8528-46d7-9bd5-eec97e2bca29\/@C03B8ZXn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Brain metastasis,HER2,Herceptin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marcela Salazar Werner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shweta Aras<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashleigh Morgan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nesteene J.

KIF18A is overexpressed in a subset of human cancers, and its elevated expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness.<br \/>Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of human cancers and is caused by persistent errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis. Aggressive types of human cancer such as high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have elevated levels of CIN and frequently harbor alterations in <i>TP53<\/i> tumor suppressor gene. These two CIN+ cancer subtypes share molecular similarities but have limited treatment options at present. The rationale of pharmacological inhibition of KIF18A motor activity is to selectively target a tumor-specific mitotic spindle vulnerability in CIN+ cancer cells while largely sparing normal diploid dividing somatic cells.<br \/>Here, we describe the identification of a novel series of potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of KIF18A MT-ATPase motor activity exemplified by AM-1882, that disrupt the mitotic spindle and selectively kill chromosomally unstable cancer cells. Our KIF18A inhibitors phenocopy genetic ablation of KIF18A and trigger spindle assembly checkpoint activation, multipolarity, and apoptosis in sensitive CIN+ cancer cell lines. The sensitivity profile of AM-1882 is focal-in-nature with cell potency in the low double-digit nanomolar range across a panel of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines, including lines that harbor genetic alterations (e.g., <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>CCNE1<\/i>, <i>RB1<\/i>, <i>BRCA1<\/i>, whole genome doubling) frequently enriched in CIN+ cancers and in HGSOC and TNBC tumor subtypes. Furthermore, the sensitivity profile of AM-1882 is distinct from comparator test agents ispinesib (Eg5, pan cytotoxic) and palbociclib (CDK4\/6, focal cytostatic). The combination of AM-1882 with PARP inhibitor olaparib is synergistic in <i>BRCA1<\/i>-deficient cancer cell lines, with evidence of increased double-strand DNA breaks (p-H2AX) and apoptosis (cl-PARP). Importantly, KIF18A inhibitors have minimal toxicity on normal dividing somatic cell types in vitro, including proliferating human bone marrow mononuclear cells, distinct from paclitaxel and small molecule inhibitors of essential mitotic kinases and kinesins. In vivo, we demonstrate that administration of KIF18A inhibitors AM-1882 and AM-5308 induce a robust pharmacodynamic response (pH3, mitotic marker) and frank tumor regressions in two <i>TP53<\/i> mutant human HGSOC xenograft models (OVCAR-3, OVCAR-8) at well-tolerated doses.<br \/>Collectively, our preclinical data provides the first example of a therapeutic strategy to selectively target CIN+ cancers through inhibition of KIF18A motor protein.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/27a824f9-10f2-4200-b07e-ee4058fb63bb\/@C03B8ZXn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinesin,Chromosomal instability,Small molecule inhibitor, KIF18A,Mitosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brain Belmontes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jodi Moriguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John \u0009 D.

We have previously shown that E-602 cleaves off terminal sialic acids from surface sialoglycans on tumor and immune cells, restores the immune function of exhausted-like T cells, and enhances dendritic cell priming and activation of na&#239;ve T cells. E-602 has also demonstrated antitumor activity as a single agent in multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models. To support clinical development, we conducted a Good Laboratory Practice one-month repeat-dose toxicity study to evaluate E-602&#8217;s pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, and safety profiles in cynomolgus monkeys via weekly intravenous infusion of E-602 at 5, 30, 100, and 200 mg\/kg for five doses. E-602 showed an apparent half-life (t<sub>1\/2<\/sub>) of 4-6 hours and the terminal t<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>of 10-30 hours with dose linearity from 30 mg\/kg to 200 mg\/kg. E-602 produced dose-dependent PD effects of desialylation of immune cells, such as T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells, as monitored by flow cytometry. Despite the short half-life of E-602, the PD effect of immune cell desialylation sustained up to seven days for T cells, consistent with E-602&#8217;s enzymatic mechanism of action. Generally, E-602 was well tolerated up to 100 mg\/kg with no dose-limiting adverse E-602-related changes in body weight, ophthalmology, neurological\/musculoskeletal assessments, electrocardiogram parameters, respiratory rate, coagulation, urinalysis, organ weights, and histopathology. Animals in the 200 mg\/kg dose group survived but showed isolated adverse histopathological changes with an uncertain relationship to E-602 administration. Therefore, the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of E-602 was determined as 100 mg\/kg in cynomolgus monkeys. In conclusion, the PK and PD data have supported the selection of cynomolgus monkeys as the toxicity species to evaluate E-602&#8217;s safety profile. E-602 has demonstrated sustained PD effects of immune cell desialylation up to seven days postdose and a wide safety margin with NOAEL of 100 mg\/kg in cynomolgus monkeys.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/945b72e4-e65c-43b5-a66a-41220f929d9c\/@C03B8ZXn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-06 Preclinical toxicology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Cancer,Toxicity,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lizhi Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenny Che<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Chesney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakesh Dixit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nancy Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Zane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Broderick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Li Peng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

While RAS-pathway targeted drugs have been approved, their activity as single-agents remains modest, supporting the need for rational targeted combinations to improve patient outcomes. Multiple studies have proposed a chemical synthetic lethality between Class I histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), and RAS-pathway inhibitors in RAS-pathway mutated models. This synthetic lethality occurs due to a combined effect to inhibit double-stranded (ds) DNA repair and other survival pathways to drive apoptosis and tumor regressions. The use of HDACi in solid tumors and combinations has been challenged by poor potency, selectivity, safety and convenience, highlighting the need for a better HDACi in the clinic. OKI-179, a novel largazole derivative, is a potent, Class I-selective, oral HDACi that has completed Ph 1 clinical trials in patients with solid tumors. The clinical profile shows the potential to achieve exposure consistent with preclinical activity with strong pharmacodynamic activity at tolerated doses, supporting the development of OKI-179 in solid tumor combinations. Here we show synergistic activity of combining OKI-179 with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib (bini) or bini + RAF-inhibitor encorafenib (enco\/bini) in both CDX and PDX models of NRAS-mutated melanoma and BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). In vitro, combining OKI-179 with bini in SKMEL-2 NRAS<sup>MT<\/sup> melanoma cells shows strong synergy, inducing a significant increase in cell death compared to single agents at clinically achievable drug concentrations. This activity was associated with a significant increase in gH2AX, a marker of ds DNA breaks, and apoptosis as measured by cleaved PARP. The activity of this combination was further investigated in vivo in established PDx models of NRAS-mutant melanoma, MEL278 and MM415. As single agents, both bini (3.5 mg\/kg PO bid,21 d) and OKI-179 (80 mg\/kg PO; 5\/wk x 3 wk), doses that mimic the clinical exposure of these molecules, showed modest tumor growth inhibition (TGI). Combining bini and OKI-179 induced significantly greater TGI, including regression in 28-50% of the tumors, as compared to 0-6% for bini alone. A similar outcome was also observed in HT29 tumors (BRAF<sup>mt<\/sup> CRC) where the combination of OKI-179 and enco\/bini showed regression in 50% of tumors, compared to 0% for OKI-179 or enco\/bini alone. This supports the potential for additive efficacy of HDACi combined with RAS-pathway inhibitors across RAS-pathway mutations and tumor types. No additivity was observed in only one model (CRC563 - BRAF<sup>mt<\/sup>). These data show the potential for OKI-179 to synergize with RAS-pathway inhibitors across multiple indications. To investigate, a Phase1b\/2 trial of OKI-179 with binimetinib in NRAS melanoma will initiate in early 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/909aec98-c443-4f6f-a945-e2115d9430f2\/@C03B8ZXn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Synthetic lethality,MEK inhibitor,RAS Pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Richard Woessner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrice Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Duncan H.
