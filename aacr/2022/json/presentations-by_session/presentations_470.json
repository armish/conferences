[{"Abstract":"Using DNA methylation profiling, already in 2016 we had identified novel molecularly defined CNS tumor entities, including CNS high grade neuroepithelial tumors with <i>MN1 <\/i>alteration (HGNET-MN1), which have in the recently updated WHO classification of CNS tumors been renamed into Astroblastoma, <i>MN1 <\/i>altered. However, little is still known about the molecular and clinical characteristics of these tumors. To further molecularly and clinically characterize this unique entity, we collected patient material, clinical information and molecular data from 176 Astroblastoma, <i>MN1 <\/i>altered tumors, which were all identified based on their characteristic DNA methylation pattern. T-SNE clustering analyses of the DNA methylation data together with our large database of almost 100,000 reference cases showed that this entity forms one main cluster defined by interchromosomal gene fusions of mainly <i>MN1 <\/i>and <i>BEND2 <\/i>and a smaller, distinct, but adjacent cluster that mainly showed tumors with <i>MN1:CXXC5 <\/i>fusions. Comparing molecular data of the <i>BEND2- <\/i>and <i>CXXC5-<\/i>fused groups we found that chromosomal copy numbers show distinct patterns, such as 16q loss in one third of cases from the <i>BEND2<\/i>-fused group, and a gain of chromosome 5 in one third of <i>CXXC5-<\/i>fused cases. Patients of the <i>BEND2<\/i>-fused group showed a strong enrichment of female patients (85%), whereas the <i>CXXC5<\/i>-fused group showed the contrary trend and consisted of 75% male patients. Original histological diagnoses of 110 <i>BEND2<\/i>-fused cases revealed that most tumors were diagnosed as an Astroblastoma (39%), followed by Ependymoma (20%) and PNET histologies (15%), which is in line with previous findings on Astroblasotma, <i>MN1 <\/i>altered cases. The <i>CXXC<\/i>5-fused subset, however, showed a distinct histological distribution and only 1 out of 13 cases (8%) had an Astroblastoma histology in the original report, whereas the other cases were diagnosed as PNET (38%), Ependymoma (23%), HGG (23%), or unknown (8%). Investigations of clinical data revealed that <i>BEND2<\/i>-fused cases (n=65) show a 5\/10 year OS of 97% and 89% and a 5\/10 year PFS of 48% and 35%, respectively, which is in line with previous studies in smaller series indicating a favorable overall but unfavorable progression-free survival. The smaller subset of <i>CXXC5<\/i>-fused patients (n=8) indicated a 5\/10 year OS of 83% and a 5\/10 year PFS of 60% each. First analyses of <i>BEND2<\/i>-fused cases indicate that an Astroblastoma histology might be associated with a favorable OS, however further analyses, including a central pathology review, are needed to validate this observation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e0b99ee3-a1c6-465d-9ccd-c181b69d9f9f\/@n03B8ZN7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Molecular subtypes,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14869"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Felix Schmitt-Hoffner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johannes Gojo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monika Mauermann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katja Von Hoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Sill<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrey Korshunov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Damian Stichel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felix Sahm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Jäger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Pfister<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcel Kool<\/i><\/presenter>.

Pathological activation of the WNT signaling pathway is characteristic for hepatoblastoma caused by mutations of <i>CTNNB1<\/i> or other genes encoding components of the pathway. Genome-wide chromosomal analyses uncovered recurrent chromosomal alterations, in particular gain of chromosome 2q, and in some cases amplification of the region 2q24 that suggests the presence of a so far unidentified oncogene in this chromosomal region. The aim of this study was to identify and further characterize this oncogene.<br \/>In the framework of the clinical hepatoblastoma study of the German Society for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, we had the opportunity to study samples of 76 hepatoblastoma patients. Using molecular inversion probe (MIP) array technology, genome-wide, high-resolution, quantitative chromosomal copy number profiles were generated and the smallest overlapping amplified region was identified. RNA and protein expression in normal and diseased tissues as well as ascribed functions of the genes located in this area were evaluated <i>in silico<\/i> in available databases. RNA expression levels of these genes were analyzed by Nanostring method and Affymetrix arrays and compared between 2q24-amplified tumors versus non-amplified tumors and normal liver tissue. The most promising candidate gene regarding its expression pattern and described function was selected for further analysis. Its protein expression was studied <i>in situ<\/i> by immunohistochemistry in hepatoblastoma tissue microarrays. The biological function was analyzed <i>in vitro<\/i> by targeted siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments in 3 hepatoblastoma cell lines (HepT1, HepG2, HuH6) und subsequent cell growth assays (MTT) and WNT signaling pathway specific luciferase reporter assays.<br \/>Gain of chromosome 2q was present in 44.7% of the cases. Amplification of the 2q24.2-24.3 region was detected in 11.8%. In the smallest overlapping amplified region of 5.6 Mbp, we could accurately map 20 protein coding genes, three genes encoding long noncoding RNAs and one gene encoding a micro-RNA. The <i>RBMS1<\/i> gene encoding a single-stranded DNA\/RNA binding protein showed significant RNA overexpression in 2q24 amplified tumors. This overexpression was validated by immunohistochemical studies at the protein level. <i>RBMS1<\/i> knockdown by specific siRNA transfection resulted in a significantly reduced proliferation of hepatoblastoma cells. <i>RBMS1<\/i> knockdown also resulted in a marked reduction of the WNT pathway activity in these cells.<br \/>We identified <i>RBMS1<\/i> located within the amplicon on chromosome 2q24 as a potential oncogenic driver in hepatoblastoma. Initial data suggest that <i>RBMS1<\/i> may exert this function by interaction with the WNT signaling pathway that is pathologically activated in hepatoblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3234ef42-866b-49bf-9eac-db356f36f0e6\/@n03B8ZN7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Amplification,Hepatoblastoma,RBMS1,WNT signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14870"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Martin Rodemann<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Verena Dreschmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evelyn Dörner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dietrich Von Schweinitz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Vokuhl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Torsten Pietsch<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have shown that all patients have a disruption in the ecology of protein kinase A activity. Hundreds of patients tested have a fusion of the first exon of DNABJ1, a heat shock protein cofactor, to PRKACA, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A and expression of this DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion oncokinase is sufficient to produce the tumor. One patient is missing the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A and three patients have a fusion of the first exon of a different protein, ATP1B1, to the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. We characterized the proteome and phosphoproteome of FLC cells relative to adjacent normal tissue. The changes were sufficiently characteristic to identify cell extracts from FLC, based solely on the proteome or phosphoproteome, and distinguishable from other tumor or normal liver. By calibrating protein level we found that tumor cells have an increase of catalytic subunit to such an extent as to exceed the capacity of protein kinase A regulatory subunits. This has two implications. First, there is free catalytic subunit that is unregulated, creating a high basal level of kinase activity. Second, the catalytic subunit is no longer localized by tethering to the regulatory subunit. Thus, the catalytic subunit has access to novel substrates. As an independent confirmation, we found the free basal kinase activity was higher in FLC cells. As a further test, we showed free catalytic subunit, that is not conjugated to regulatory subunit, is higher in FLC cells. We next tested whether these changes were solely due to overexpression of the catalytic subunit or if there was some additional change in the intrinsic activity of the kinase as a result of the fusion. We purified, without using an affinity tag, either PRKACA (which is myristoylated), DNAJB1-PRKACA, and PRKACA which was not myristoylated (the DNAJB1-PRKACA is not myristoylated). As a further control we also used the PRKACAL206R mutation, which does not engage regulatory subunits and is present in some forms of Cushing&#8217;s disease. We purified cytosol from human liver, blocked activity of all the endogenous kinases, and added our purified kinase. Mass spectrometry was then used to identify all newly phosphorylated proteins. While many proteins were equally phosphorylated by all four kinases (PRKACA, DNAJB1-PRKACA, PRKACA not myristoylated, PRKACAL206R) there were some distinct differences. From an analysis of these we found alterations in the optimal recognition sequence for phosphorylation for each variant of the kinase. Significantly, when we examined the human tissue data, we found many proteins that were phosphorylated by the DNAJB1-PRKACA in vitro were also phosphorylated in patient tumor tissue, but not in adjacent non-transformed tissue. This validated these observations of altered phosphorylation from the in vitro assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a4fb3f35-c47f-4437-9d6a-1a1255cf4fff\/@n03B8ZN7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion proteins,Liver cancer,Pediatric cancers,Phosphorylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14872"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Solomon Levin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahsa Shironi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Jarmel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Tomasini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bassem Shebl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tova Finkelstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Requena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soeren Heissel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henrik Molina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Coffino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Lyons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sanford M.

This study aims, in partnership with the patient community, to search for associations between various demographic and clinical factors and overall survival of patients, to assess prognostic factors. We performed a retrospective analysis on a community-based patient registry (The Fibrolamellar Registry http:\/\/fibroregistry.org) to examine relations between survival and different variables. The variables examined were demographic (gender), clinical (age at diagnosis, tumor size, number of tumors inside the liver, presence of positive lymph nodes or distant metastasis) as well as treatment modalities (surgery or systemic therapy). Kaplan-Meier survival plots were created for the overall research population and for stratifying by unadjusted variables. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable analysis of hazard ratio (HR) for death at any time among groups, adjusting for variables found significant in the univariate analysis. Among 150 patients, (89 females and 61 males), median overall survival time from diagnosis to death or loss of follow-up was 8 years and 2 months. Features with independent positive effect on survival were female gender, as well as being treated with surgery alone. In contrast, having 10 or more tumors inside the liver had a negative effect on survival. Positive lymph nodes at diagnosis, and distant metastasis at diagnosis, were both associated with poorer prognosis, though did not remain independent when adjusting for covariables. We could not find an effect of age at diagnosis or tumor size at its largest measurement, on survival. In conclusion, our study suggests gender is a significant prognostic factor for FLC patients, with females having a better outcome than males. Surgical removal of the tumor, without additional systemic therapy is a positive prognostic factor as well. Having a large number of tumors of 10 and above, despite all being inside the liver, is a negative prognostic factor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68048e6b-e166-4a6b-a353-54ce02ee2b57\/@n03B8ZN7\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Survival,Liver cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14884"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Amichai Berkovitz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachael D.

Little is known about etiology; however, evidence supporting in utero origins of pediatric and adult GCT suggests that disruptions in normal germ cell development are likely to be highly relevant. Germline copy number variants (CNVs) are a plausible source of inherited genetic variation and have not been thoroughly evaluated to date. CNVs on the X chromosome are of particular interest because individuals with both Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) and Turner syndrome (45, X) are at increased risk of pediatric GCT, suggesting that alterations in X chromosome dosage contribute to etiology. A family study of adult testicular cancer where at least one member had bilateral cancer identified a significant linkage peak at Xq27 (hLOD=4.7). In addition, somatic copy number gains of chromosome X are frequently seen in adult testicular germ cell tumors. Given these findings in adult GCT, similar aberrations may also be relevant risk factors for the pediatric group. Pediatric GCT samples were obtained from a Children&#8217;s Oncology Group study and state biobank programs in Michigan and California. Genotyping array data were generated using the Illumina HumanCoreExome Beadchip (Illumina, San Diego). CNV calls were made for 2,002 GCT cases and 1,402 controls with high quality intensity data using Genvisis, which has specialized algorithms to make CNV calls on the X chromosome. Klinefelter syndrome cases (n=27) were excluded from the analyses. No study sample had classic Turner syndrome; however, one female case had a giant 51Mb deletion of Xq. Analyses were performed for females-only, males-only, and everyone together. We identified two regions that are study-wide significant on chromosome X at Xq27.1 and Xp11.2 and one nominally significant near Xq28. The most significant finding was identified in females-only and is located within a region that encodes genes within the SPANX family. Evidence suggests these genes affect germ cells; however, supporting data is reported in spermatozoa rather than oocytes. The events in our study were large (240kb), had similar breakpoints, and appear to be flanked by repetitive DNA that might lead to recurrent events at the same region. The variant was present in the control samples within gnomAD at a low allele frequency (0.18%). In our study, both deletions and duplications were noted: 11 female cases (1 or 2 expected based on gnomAD allele frequencies) and 0 female controls (0-1 expected).

Relapsed infant ALL carries a particularly poor prognosis and is often resistant to further attempts at re-induction. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data on samples collected at diagnosis from <i>KMT2A-r<\/i> infant ALL patients to identify genes differentially expressed between cases known to later relapse versus those known to stay in remission. We subsequently describe potential molecular pathways that may explain the predisposition for the majority of these patients to relapse.<br \/>We performed 10x Genomics Chromium single-cell sequencing (Multiome v1 chemistry) to obtain gene expression data on blood or bone marrow samples collected at diagnosis from a total of 25 infants with <i>KMT2A-r<\/i> ALL; 19 of these cases later went on to relapse (the Rel group) while 6 did not (non-Rel). Differential expression analysis (DEA) was performed using the Seurat package (v4.0.2) in R 4.0.3, selecting positive (upregulated) genes only with a log fold change cutoff of 0.25. QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (v1.20.04) was then used to generate a list of molecular pathways described by these differentially upregulated genes (p&#60;.05), one for each group: Rel as compared to non-Rel and vice versa. We then compared the two lists to identify potentially biologically significant markers with possible prognostic value.<br \/>We sequenced an average of 1191 cells total per patient over six captures. Following DEA, we found a total of 1168 genes that were enriched in the Rel group relative to the non-Rel group. Conversely, a total of 1240 genes were enriched in the non-Rel group relative to the Rel group. These genes were cross referenced to the KEGG database&#8217;s &#8220;Pathways in Cancer&#8221; list (hsa05200). The top 3 genes in the Rel group were <i>ZBTB16<\/i>, <i>IL6ST<\/i>, <i>BCL2L11<\/i>. The top 3 genes in the non-Rel group were <i>MSH6<\/i>, <i>LEF1<\/i>, and <i>CDK6<\/i>. Following IPA analysis, a total of 160 canonical pathways were described in the Rel group, and a total of 70 canonical pathways were described in the non-Rel group. Three intracellular signal transduction pathways present in the KEGG list above that were disproportionately present in the Rel group at diagnosis with statistical significance and potential prognostic value were PI3K, AKT, and mTOR signaling.<br \/>Since increased activation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway is specifically associated with chemoresistance in ALL, our findings suggest that this pathway could potentially be used as an indicator of potential relapse in infant ALL patients. Future studies, currently in progress, will compare the above data to scRNAseq data from infant <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r ALL samples collected at relapse to further investigate signaling pathway activation and clonal evolution in infant ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e5880ca4-8274-4d7d-ab48-f635bf6ec6ff\/@n03B8ZN7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,Pathway,PI3K,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14875"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sidharth Ramesh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irina Pushel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byunggil Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Midhat S.

Tissue biopsy of Rb can cause tumor spread, so it is contraindicated. We demonstrated that aqueous humor (AH), an ocular fluid, is a high yield liquid biopsy enabling <i>in vivo<\/i> detection of tumor-derived cell free DNA (cfDNA) thus overcoming the contraindication to biopsy. Prognostic genomic cfDNA biomarkers in Rb AH enables objective real time disease monitoring.<br \/>In ~13% of Rb, tumor progression is driven by epigenetic deregulation of tumor-promoting pathways without detectable genomic alterations. However, epigenetic studies have been done only on tumor from surgically removed eyes. The frequency and effect of epigenomic regulation in eyes that have been saved with therapy is not clear due to no access to <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor. Therefore, epigenetic analysis of AH cfDNA is highly desired to understand the broader spectrum of Rb tumorigenesis and prognosis.<br \/>Materials and Methods:<i> <\/i>16 AH samples and 4 Rb tumors from 12 patients with 14 Rb eyes were included in the study. We conducted global DNA methylation profiling of tumor tissues from surgically removed Rb eyes, AH samples collected from different clinical stages with different treatment outcomes using the Illumina Infinium EPIC DNA methylation BeadArray platform. Publicly available DNA methylation data of normal retina, Rb eyes, and Rb patients were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, GSE57362) for cell type DNA methylation comparisons.<br \/>Results: Our preliminary studies revealed a high degree of concordance in genome-wide differential DNA methylation patterns between paired AH and tumor samples. Integrating our data with large public datasets, we identified reliable RB DNA methylation signatures in cfDNA that have potential diagnostic and prognostic values. We also identified hypermethylation at <i>RB1<\/i> promoter, which suggested <i>RB1<\/i> is druggable to DNA methylation inhibitors. By integrating DNA methylation data with gene expression data, we identified over 300 differentially expressed genes potentially regulated by DNA methylation change. Pathway analysis indicated several tumor suppressor pathways (e.g., <i>RB1<\/i> and <i>P53<\/i> pathways) were suppressed and some oncogenic pathways were activated (e.g., <i>E2F<\/i> pathways).<br \/>Conclusions: Our study sets the stage for exploiting epigenetic markers in AH and identifying potential therapeutic targets to improve the clinical management of patients with RB.<i> <\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e17a75f2-5c19-4248-ba65-1eed0a4797e6\/@n03B8ZN7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Methylation,Personalized medicine,Retinoblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14876"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"edcc28a3-68fa-4b69-9d15-2bb645f6e828","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/edcc28a3-68fa-4b69-9d15-2bb645f6e828\/@n03B8ZN7\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liya Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongtao Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Weisenberger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gangning Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Berry<\/i><\/presenter>.

Metastatic disease is the most common cause of disease-related death and is rare in high-income countries. Therefore, little is known about the genomics, transcriptomics and methylomics of extraocular retinoblastoma. Here we present a series of extraocular retinoblastoma cases analyzed at DNA, RNA and methylation level to elucidate the landscape of the metastatic disease. These samples were analyzed by OncoScan CNV, CytoScan HD or whole-exome sequencing, depending on sample availability, for CNA (clonal and subclonal) and mutation analysis; RNAseq for fusion and expression data, and Infinium MethylationEPIC assay for methylation examination. Hierarchical clustering and subtype classification was performed using previously published expression and methylation signatures. Cell cultures were successfully established for 4 tumor specimens. <i>In vitro<\/i> pharmacological sensitivity of those cell cultures was determined by MTT assay. In total, 11 patients and 14 samples were studied (55% male, 64% unilateral). One patient was RB+\/+ and harbored a <i>MYCN<\/i> amplification. Dissemination sites included orbit (n=8), systemic (n=3), and central nervous system (n=5). Median age at diagnosis was 27 months (5-48); 36% were already metastatic. All samples were classified as subtype 2 retinoblastoma according to Liu et. al., 2021, both at the expression and methylation level. Among recurrent CNAs in all samples, common retinoblastoma alterations were observed: 1q (86%), 2p (71%, 29% <i>MYCN<\/i> amplified), 6p (93%) gains and 16q (64%) loss. Other less frequent alterations such as 17q gain (21%) and 11q (43%) and 19q (29%) loss were found. <i>MYCN<\/i> pathway alteration was the most outstanding feature, evidenced by frequent gains\/amplification on that gene and in gene-expression clustering based on <i>MYCN<\/i> expression signatures. Global hypomethylation was also observed when comparing metastatic to intraocular samples and it was consistent with the general gene overexpression seen in metastatic samples. Metastasis-derived <i>in vitro<\/i> cultures treated either with melphalan, topotecan, idarubicin, doxorubicin or carboplatin showed various degrees of sensitivity (i.e. EC50 in the nM to mM range), with no clear association to <i>MYCN<\/i> overexpression. In conclusion, even considering the caveats regarding our current sample size, we could detect the alteration of the <i>MYCN<\/i> pathway as a distinct characteristic of extraocular retinoblastoma. Global hypomethylation has been related to the activation of oncogenic drivers and is consistent with metastatic behavior. These results suggest a pattern of molecular features that may have been selected during tumor evolution. Our results do not support a straightforward relationship between <i>MYCN<\/i> activation and resistance to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e92057ad-aa24-4beb-9781-3cf828490468\/@o03B8ZN8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Metastasis,Pediatric cancers,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14877"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daiana Ganiewich<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santiago Zugbi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosario Aschero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniela Ottaviani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>María B.

However, mechanisms leading to metastasis in this disease remain poorly understood. To deepen our knowledge on the main players in ES metastasis, Microarray (Clariom&#8482; D Array, Affymetrix) and phosphoarray (Phospho Explorer Antibody Arrays, Full Moon Biosystems) analyses were performed on primary tumours (n=5) and metastases (n=12) samples from an spontaneous metastatic ES mouse model<sup>2<\/sup>. After normalisation and bioinformatics analysis, a list of differentially expressed genes\/proteins between the 2 sample groups was obtained. Candidates were validated by qPCR (TaqMan&#8482; probes) and Western Blot, and further characterised <i>in vitro <\/i>through loss-of-function phenotypic assays (proliferation, clonogenic and migration) using siRNAs and\/or inhibitors. Several genes and proteins of interest, including LOXHD1, confirmed to be overexpressed in metastases samples compared to primary tumours as identified by microarray\/phosphoarray analyses and qPCR\/Western Blot validation. Also, candidates subjected to transient loss-of-function phenotypic assays significantly decreased in all cases tumorigenic and\/or metastatic capabilities of ES cells when suppressed. Additionally, LOXHD1 showed upregulation in sphere-growing ES cells, validating its role in ES hypoxia and metastasis as demonstrated previously<sup>3<\/sup>. Using stable knock-out models of the genes of interest, the exact mechanism and pathways in which these candidates play a role in ES metastasis will be further studied <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>.

This absence of information raises the question whether therapeutic strategies should be the same as for their counterparts in immunocompetent (IC) patients. The aim of this study was to characterize genetically and immunophenotypically pediatric monomorphic PTLD.<br \/>Thirty-nine monomorphic PTLD &#8804;19 years-old (mean 10y, gender 25 male\/14 female) were recruited and analyzed for germinal center markers, IRF4 and EBER expression. Presence of MYC, PAX5, IRF4, BCL2, BCL6 and 11q alterations was investigated by FISH. Additional molecular studies included clonality, copy number (CN) arrays, cell of origin-COO (Nanostring) and mutational analyses (Custom 167 lymphoma related genes panel, SureSelectXT, Agilent).<br \/>Twenty-nine patients received solid organ transplantation and eight were hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. The mean time from transplant to PTLD diagnosis was 34 months (range 2-170) and the estimated 5-year overall survival (5y-OS) rate was 67%. Patients that received a solid organ had a better prognosis than hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (5y-OS 83% vs. 38%, p=0.03).<br \/>Thirty-three cases were classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and six as Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Thirty-two cases had extranodal localization, 21 of which in the gastrointestinal tract. Among the DLBCL, 24\/28 cases had an ABC\/non-GC COO phenotype and the six BL were GCB. EBER was positive in 33\/37 cases. Five out of six BL and one DLBCL had MYC rearrangements, while no 11q alterations or other rearrangements were observed.<br \/>Ten out of the 23 pediatric monomorphic PTLD studied displayed CN alterations (mean 1.6 alt\/case; range 0-12). Comparative analyses showed that pediatric PTLD had lower genetic complexity than BL (Scholtysik, 2010) and DLBCL (Ramis-Zaldivar, 2020) in IC patients and adult-PTLD (Ferreiro, 2016; Rinaldi, 2010) and lacked characteristic CN alterations of those groups. Regarding the mutational profile, all 6 PTLD-BL carried MYC mutations in addition to ID3 (4 cases), ARID1A (2 cases) or CCND3 (1 case) and a higher mutational burden than PTLD-DLBCL (12.3 vs 6.2, p=0.01). PTLD-DLBCL showed a very heterogeneous profile characterized by a lower number of mutations than their counterparts in IC patients (2.4 vs 6.5, p=0.01). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that epigenetic modifiers and NOTCH pathway (4 cases each) were the most recurrently affected. Two out of 20 cases were classified as N1 according to LymphGen (Wright, 2020) algorithm while the rest remained undetermined.<br \/>The mutational profile of pediatric PTLD-BL is similar to that observed in IC patients whereas PTLD-DLBCL are less complex than their counterpart in IC children and present a very heterogeneous mutational landscape with enrichment in NOTCH pathway mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09b74ecb-96d8-41ef-a03f-92f774297215\/@o03B8ZN8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Pediatric cancers,Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14879"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia Salmeron<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalia Castrejón-de-Anta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pilar Guerra-Garcia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joan Enric Ramis-Zaldivar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mónica López-Guerra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dolors Colomer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco Diaz-Crespo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta Garrido<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javier Menarguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria del Mar Andrés<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eugenia Garcia-Fernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Margarita Llavador<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noelia Garcia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Blanca Gonzalez-Farré<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Idoia Martin-Guerrero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Garrido<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Itziar Astigarraga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alba Fernández<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaime Verdú-Amorós<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soledad González-Muñíz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Berta Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Verónica Celis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elias Campo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Balagué<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Itziar Salaverria<\/i><\/presenter>.

Obtaining gene-level resolution of these large structural variants is not possible with lower resolution karyotyping approaches and can be challenging using RNA sequencing approaches due to low transcript abundance or low-quality RNA. Furthermore, the ability of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to detect fusions is limited by the targeted nature of these assays and subject to which probes were run. Here, we used a novel method, Arima-HiC sequencing, on 6 archived pediatric cancer samples to determine the technique&#8217;s effectiveness in detecting gene fusions. We first adapted the Arima Hi-C method for use with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. We then selected four archived pediatric alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) tumors (FFPE archival period range: 8-12 years)&#8212;known to be fusion-positive via prior clinical testing&#8212;for Arima-HiC sequencing. Briefly, FFPE tissue scrolls were dewaxed, and the tissue rehydrated; it then underwent chromatin digestion, end-labeling, and proximity ligation prior to DNA purification per the Arima-HiC FFPE protocol. Purified DNA was next prepared as a short-read sequencing library and sequenced on a HiSeq 2500. The raw reads were aligned and deduplicated, and structural variants were called using the HiC-Breakfinder software. We additionally selected 2 non-FFPE cases, both pediatric leukemia cases with cryopreserved blasts (archival period range: 1-3 years), for Arima-HiC sequencing (as above). These cases had undergone standard of care cytogenetic (karyotyping, FISH) and molecular (targeted cancer NGS sequencing panel) testing clinically and a genetic driver \/ known gene fusion had not been identified. Using Arima-HiC sequencing, we identified either a <i>PAX3<\/i>-<i>FOXO1<\/i> (n=2) or <i>PAX7<\/i>-<i>FOXO1<\/i> (n=2) gene fusion in each of our 4 ARMS cases, consistent with the original diagnostic cytogenetic finding. HiC data was additionally able to provide partner gene information (<i>PAX3<\/i> or <i>PAX7<\/i>) in 2 of the 4 cases where this was unknown. We also test two cases of leukemia, one, a case of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in a 3-year-old male, and the other, a case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a 2-year-old female. In the first case, we detected an <i>EP300<\/i>-<i>ZNF384<\/i> gene fusion, which is a known, but rare, gene fusion seen in B-ALL. This finding is clinically relevant as <i>ZNF384<\/i> fusions are associated with a more favorable prognosis. In the second case, we detected a <i>SCN4B<\/i>-<i>MLLT10<\/i> gene fusion. This finding is also clinically relevant as <i>MLLT10<\/i> fusions are rare in AML but indicate an unfavorable prognosis. In summary, this study demonstrates how Arima-HiC sequencing provides molecular diagnostic value in archived pediatric solid and liquid tumor specimens via the identification of clinically relevant gene fusions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b31e849-6db5-486b-93e4-9e7338af4220\/@o03B8ZN8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular diagnosis,Leukemias,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Fusion genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14880"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Midhat S.

The DICER1 enzyme is a key component of the microRNA biogenesis pathway. Reflecting this central role, patients who inherit or acquire mutations in the <i>DICER1<\/i> gene have an increased risk of developing a spectrum of benign and malignant tumors &#8212;thereby earning the recognition as a pediatric cancer predisposition syndrome known as <i>DICER1<\/i> syndrome (OMIM 601200). <i>DICER1<\/i> syndrome is definitively diagnosed by DNA sequencing demonstrating presence of a loss of function mutation on one copy of <i>DICER1 <\/i>plus a &#8220;hotspot&#8221; mutation on the other copy of <i>DICER1<\/i>. As tumor and germline DNA sequencing can pose logistical and\/or cost difficulties, a complementary diagnostic method based on marker expression is valuable for both diagnostics and surveillance. Biomarkers that are candidate therapeutic targets are also appealing as these may offer a more tailored approach for therapy. As there are no approved biomarkers for identification of <i>DICER1-<\/i>associated tumors, we performed RNAseq and miRNAseq in an engineered murine mesenchymal cell model that incorporates a specific <i>DICER1<\/i> hotspot mutation to identify candidates. We validated candidate biomarkers at the RNA (Eya2, Vipr1, miR-139-3p, and miR-30d-3p) and protein (Eya2, and Vipr1) levels <i>in vitro<\/i>, to provide proof of principle data for their eventual clinical utility. The miRNA candidate biomarkers levels were evaluated in both total and small extracellular vesicle-enriched fractions.

Our models use prior knowledge of genome regulation and may identify cellular processes that help develop molecular therapies. We previously developed a classifier algorithm, netDx, which uses similarity networks to integrate heterogeneous patient data and predict outcome<sup>1<\/sup>. netDx demonstrates excellent performance and allows measures to be grouped into biologically meaningful features (e.g. grouping genes into pathway features).<br \/>Ependymoma Methods:<i> <\/i>We predicted survival in PFA-EP using 569 methylomes<sup>2<\/sup> (Illumina 450K). Using netDx, we evaluated a model that grouped CpG-level methylation into sets reflecting 25 cell types from the developing human cerebellum, 3 chromatin states, EZH2 binding sites, and brain super enhancers (80:20 train\/test split, feature selection &#62;=8\/10; 10 splits). This model was compared to a baseline lacking prior knowledge.<br \/>Preliminary Results: Organizing methylomes by prior knowledge significantly improves prognostic prediction (Table 1, p &#60; 5x10<sup>-3<\/sup>, one-sided WMW). Features that predict prognosis are consistent with known dysregulation in PFA-EP<sup>2<\/sup> (Table 1).<br \/>G3\/4 MB Methods: We predicted binarized survival using 285 methylomes<sup>3<\/sup> (Illumina 450K), using identical methods as above.<br \/>Preliminary results: Tumor methylomes carry predictive signal for survival prediction (Table 1), consistent with previous findings. We are currently evaluating the effect of including prior knowledge.<br \/>Interim Conclusion: Prior knowledge can improve survival prediction in PFA-EP and identifies features reflecting tumor biology.

NBL exhibits a wide spectrum of phenotypes, from low-risk cases that spontaneously regress to high-risk cases with 50% mortality, and it is responsible for 12% to 15% of deaths due to childhood cancer. While genome-wide association studies have identified a handful of risk loci, the germline genetic origins of sporadic NBL remain largely unknown. Notably, NBL is one of several childhood cancers that tend to co-occur with specific birth defects, which could point to novel genetic origins. For example, the risk of neuroblastoma is increased 3- to 7-fold among children with certain congenital heart defects (CHD). It is hypothesized that this co-occurrence arises from pleiotropic defects in the neural crest cells that are progenitors of both NBL and some heart structures. Based on these lines of evidence, we hypothesize that novel germline risk loci for NBL can be identified through pleiotropic analyses of CHD and NBL cohorts. Therefore, in this study we seek to identify germline risk loci for neuroblastoma by jointly analyzing CHD and NBL data sets with a primary focus on <i>de novo<\/i> variants.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Using whole genome sequencing data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center, we will identify NBL and CHD associated loci by testing for high rates of <i>de novo<\/i> variants (DNV) in each cohort separately and in the two cohorts combined. The testing strategy compares the rate of DNV to the expected locus-specific mutation rate. In our primary analyses, we will focus on genes known to be associated with CHD in order to reduce the multiple testing penalty for that family of loci. A broader analysis will explore coding and regulatory loci genome wide to identify loci associated jointly with NBL and CHD.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We acquired whole genome sequencing data of parent-offspring trios for NBL (n=609) and CHD (n=711) from the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center. The probands in the NBL cohort was 54% male and 81% Non-Hispanic White, with a median age at diagnosis of 16 months. The probands in the CHD cohort was 59% male and 60% Non-Hispanic White. The most common CHD phenotypes were ventricular septal defect (46%), tetralogy of Fallot (32%), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (28%), atrial septal defect (25%), and right aortic arch (25%). Analyses to identify DNV are ongoing.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The identification of germline risk loci associated with NBL will help to inform the developmental origins of this important childhood cancer and may inform novel risk stratification protocols and therapies. This study also aims to help explain the NBL-CHD co-occurrence, and that could shed light on the development of other neural crest cell derived cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/65a5505b-c104-4633-a360-db994139bef6\/@p03B8ZN9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Congenital Heart Defect,Whole genome sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14885"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander Renwick<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yao Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chad Huff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip J.
