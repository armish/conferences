[{"Abstract":"<b>Objective:<\/b> Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been recommended for resectable ESCC patients, the 5-year overall survival rate was less than 50%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to be efficient for advanced ESCC, while few studies focus on the neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Herein, we designed a trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy for resectable ESCC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> All patients had treatment-na&#239;ve resectable ESCC (stage III) that were confirmed by histopathology. All patients were scheduled to receive surgery within 4-6 weeks after neoadjuvant treatment (2 cycles) consisting of PD-1 inhibitors (Camrelizumab 200mg or Sintilimab 200 mg or Tislelizumab 200 mg) combined with two conventional chemotherapy regimens (Cisplatin + paclitaxel). The primary endpoint was the major pathologic response (MPR). Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), R0 resection rate and safety profile. Immune signature of immune cells were evaluated in surgical specimens using immunofluorescence.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Between Aug. 1, 2020, and Oct. 1, 2021, we assessed 10 patients for screening, of whom 10 patients were enrolled. Neoadjuvant therapy was not associated with delays in surgery or increased surgical complications\/mortality. The median follow-up was 5.0 months (range 2.0&#8764;31.0 months). Ten (100.0%) successfully underwent R0 resection. Of the 10 evaluable patients, 6 (60.0%) were MPR, 4 (40.0%) were pathologic complete response (pCR). Imaging evaluation was feasible in all patients. Partial response (PR) was achieved in 1 (10.0%) and stable disease (SD) was observed in 8 (80.0%). The most common treatment-related grade 1-2 adverse events were anemia (5, 50.0%), nausea (3, 30.0%), vomiting (3, 30.0%), constipation (2, 20.0%) and myelosuppression (2, 20.0%). There was no grade 3-4 events and treatment-related deaths. The presence of CD3+ T cells, B cell, and CD56 bright were statistically comparable patient groups of MPR and pCR, with an increased tendency in pCR patients. In addition, macrophages, CD8+ T cells, PD-1+CD8+ T cell, Treg cells, and PD-L1+CD68+ cells in pCR patients showed a downward trend.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitors plus chemotherapies had manageable treatment-related toxic effects. This regimen induced pCR or MPR in 100.0% of resected tumor, demonstrating its antitumor efficacy in resectable ESCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/35ec7dd1-d2c0-43a7-b678-0385b390066f\/@v03B8ZU9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Immunotherapy,Neoadjuvant,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17599"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bo Jiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junling Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengli Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

The clinical applicability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been explored, although there is currently no consensus regarding how to integrate its findings for cancer staging. We performed a retrospective analysis of the mutational landscape of 13 patients with multiple tumors and underwent surgery at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Sep. 2018 to Dec. 2020.The cohort consisted mostly of women (11\/13, 84.6%) and non-smokers (12\/13, 92.3%). Median age was 58 years (range 26-71). No patient manifested relapse after a median follow-up duration of 11.2 months (range 8.2-36.0). NGS was performed with a large panel (&#8805; 350 genes) in most cases (11\/13, 84.6%). Most nodules were invasive adenocarcinomas (25\/41, 61.0%), followed by adenocarcinomas in situ (13\/41, 31.7%), and minimally invasive adenocarcinomas (3\/41, 7.3%). Four patients were clinically diagnosed with IPM, of whom 1 had only one nodule sequenced. Of the 12 patients with genomic profiles from multiple nodules, 10 (83.3%) had consistent NGS inference and clinical diagnosis of MPLC or IPM. Of the remaining two, P1 was clinically diagnosed with IPM but NGS did not detect any genomic aberrations from one nodule, which may have missed evidence that could have led to inference of clonal relationship. P8 was diagnosed with MPLC but had two nodules that harbored <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R mutation. NGS revealed clonal relationships that enabled high-confidence differential diagnosis in the concordant cases. For instance, the 3 nodules in P10 each harbored an oncogenic driver: <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 19 deletion, <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R, and <i>ALK<\/i> fusion, which were suggestive of tumor clones of separate origins. Similar mutual exclusion was also observed in P6 (<i>EGFR<\/i> exon 19 deletion vs L858R), P2 (<i>EGFR<\/i> exon 19 deletion vs <i>MAP2K1<\/i>), and P7 (2 <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 18 mutations G719A and E709 in one nodule vs <i>EGFR<\/i> E746_A750del in another). On the other hand, P9 illustrates a case of complex clonal architecture, in which 8 nodules were derived from 5 origins. Further analysis found that alterations in <i>KRAS <\/i>were associated with smaller nodule size, whereas those in <i>TP53, CDKN2A<\/i>, <i>NKX2-1, <\/i>or<i> GNAS <\/i>were associated with greater size.In summary, NGS achieved highly concordant MPLC\/IPM differentiation with clinical diagnosis based on histopathologic and radiographic evidence. However, caution is warranted when NGS detects no aberration from any of the multiple sequenced nodules. Examination of the mutational landscape found that altered proto-oncogene <i>KRAS<\/i> was associated with smaller tumors whereas altered tumor suppressors <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>CDKN2A<\/i> associated with smaller ones, suggesting different roles in these molecules play in tumor growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b13a61d8-b761-43df-b5bf-517e777d316b\/@v03B8ZU9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Multiple primary lung cancer,Differential diagnosis,Clonal architecture,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17601"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wenyang Jiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luting Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Zou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiqiu Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qing Geng<\/i><\/presenter>.

The presence of co-occurring genomic alterations likely contribute to this diversity in clinical outcomes. Here, we report on a patient with metastatic NSCLC with a <i>ROS1<\/i> fusion and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (<i>KRAS<\/i>) G12C mutation detected at diagnosis who experienced a short duration of disease control on targeted therapy. The patient was initially treated with entrectinib, a <i>ROS1<\/i> TKI, and, at progression, also received sotorasib, a small molecule inhibitor of <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C, in combination. Using specimens from therapeutically relevant time points including at diagnosis, at time of resistance to entrectinib, and at time of resistance to entrectinib and concurrent sotorasib, we performed broad next generation sequencing and FISH studies to detail the development of therapy resistance. Variant allele frequency of KRAS G12C was increased at each time point (3.2%, 74.2%, and 97%, respectively). A cell line was derived from the patient at time of progression on entrectinib therapy. <i>In vitro<\/i> testing of the cell line demonstrated increased TKI responsiveness when treated with entrectinib and sotorasib. Signaling pathway analysis of the cell line showed entrectinib inhibited phosphorylation of ROS1 and AKT, but not ERK. Sotorasib alone or in combination with entrectinib resulted in decreased phosphorylation of ERK. <i>In vitro<\/i> testing suggested efficacy with the combination of entrectinib and sotorasib. However, in clinical follow up the patient&#8217;s disease demonstrated progression on the combination, likely related to <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C amplification.

However, these combination treatments also resulted in increased toxicity with intolerability. Thus, this study evaluated the possible role of single MET inhibition in these distinct tumors.<br \/>Methods: Using gefitinib-resistant <i>MET<\/i>-amplified lung cancer cells (HCC827GR), we tested the sensitivity to single MET inhibitor with various conditions. Supporting preclinical data with cell lines, the matched case reports and drug-sensitivity tests using patient-derived cells were presented. Furthermore, we chronically treated HCC827GR with single MET inhibitor to establish MET inhibitor-resistant cell line (HCC827GR_PR). And then, we explored putative resistance mechanisms of the HCC827GR_PR cells.<br \/>Results: The HCC827GR cells were partially inhibited by single MET inhibitor regardless of gefitinib-free duration or drug exposure time. Three patients with stage IV <i>MET<\/i>-amplified and <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant lung cancer resistant to EGFR inhibitor showed initially definite response to single crizotinib treatment but their disease progressed within two or three months. The copy number of <i>MET<\/i> gene in plasma circulating tumor DNA was decreased significantly during crizotinib treatment and not increased even after progression to crizotinib. In their post-crizotinib tumor, <i>MET<\/i> amplification was disappeared in fluorescence in situ hybridization test. In vitro drug test using patient-derived cells revealed the sensitivity to EGFR inhibitor was recovered after single crizotinib treatment. We established HCC827GR_PR resistant to single MET inhibitor. In the major clones of HCC827GR_PR cells, <i>EGFR<\/i> signaling pathway was reactivated and gefitinib successfully suppressed their survival. Furthermore, increased <i>MET<\/i> gene copy number or bypass activation of FGFR1 were observed as resistance mechanism in the minor clones of HCC827GR_PR cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Single MET inhibitor could be effective but its efficacy could not durable in patients with <i>MET<\/i>-amplified and <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant lung cancer resistant to EGFR inhibitors because these resistant cells might be subclones. A novel combination strategy is needed to get both long-term efficacy and less toxicity in these lung cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/485e3985-255b-46ef-abc1-7b9e87057a2d\/@v03B8ZU9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,EGFR,c-Met,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17605"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Youngjoo Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Ra Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun Hye Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunshin Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seog&#8209;Yun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Youn Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

Data analysis and annotation of variants are significant barriers to NGS adoption. NAVIFY&#174; Mutation Profiler (NMP) is a CE-marked*, cloud-based tertiary analysis software that provides curation, annotation, and reporting of somatic genomic alterations and biomarker signatures identified by NGS. It provides information on genomic variants based on published biomedical literature, public genomic databases, medical guidelines, drug labels, and results of clinical trials. The software leverages classification guidelines based on AMP, to provide information on detected somatic genomic variants, and inform on associated therapies according to region specific approvals. To validate accuracy and reproducibility of the NMP software and curation process for hematologic malignancies, a clinical evaluation study was performed.<br \/>Methods: NMP 2.1 was used as a tertiary analysis software. A total of 86 variants derived from hematologic malignancies (including myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, B cell lymphomas and multiple myeloma), contrived as 12 VCF files were generated. These comprised of the following classes of genomic alterations: single nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, fusions, copy number alterations, and indels. Out of 86 variants 42 were Tier 1A and 44 were non-Tier 1A, based on AMP classification. The study was performed at 4 external sites with 7 software users (molecular genetics experts). Users uploaded the VCF files into the NMP software, and processed them with instructions provided. NMP reported AMP tier of variants and associated therapies were evaluated for agreement among the users.<br \/>Results: For the reproducibility, 100% agreement for the hematologic malignancy cases was achieved for each agreement analysis, demonstrating software users can produce the exact same output, given the same files and condition variables entered into the software. For accuracy, tier classification agreement was 91.34% for Tier IA and 95.02% for all hematologic variants. The agreement on associated therapies for the NMP classified Tier IA hematologic variants was 99.08%.<br \/>Conclusions: NAVIFY&#174; Mutation Profiler is a robust automated solution for genomic variant reporting of hematologic malignancies. The tier classifications and available therapies resulting from the NMP annotation and curation are highly concordant with molecular genetics experts. With the increasing number of known clinically relevant genomic variants in hematologic malignancies, software capable of automatically identifying and accurately classifying somatic genomic variants, promises to decrease the manual review time necessary in clinical practice. *CE-IVD.

Given complex resistance mechanisms beyond combined MEK inhibition, limited data exists to evaluate combinations with CRAF\/ARAF\/MET\/mTOR inhibitors and cytotoxic chemotherapy in sustaining response and overcoming resistance. We explore patient outcomes comparing vemurafenib monotherapy with the above combination therapies in this analysis.<br \/>METHODS: A pooled analysis of 5 phase 1\/2 clinical trials containing vemurafenib was conducted between January 2012 and October 2020 in BRAF V600E mutant advanced or metastatic tumors. Overall survival (OS) and Progression free survival (PFS) in vemurafenib monotherapy (V) arm compared with vemurafenib + crizotinib (VC), vemurafenib + sorafenib (VS), vemurafenib + everolimus (VE) and vemurafenib + paclitaxel + carboplatin (VPC) arms were assessed. Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR=CR+PR+SD&#8805;6 months) and safety profile of combination arms were also explored.<br \/>RESULTS: 99 patients were enrolled across 5 studies. Median age was 57 years with 78% of ECOG 1 and M:F ratio at 1:1. Tumor types included NSCLC (13%), Thyroid cancer (12%), Low and High-grade Gliomas (7%), Colorectal cancer (6%), Cholangiocarcinoma (5%) and ECD (3%). V arm derived greatest clinical benefit with median OS at 21 months while addition of PC arm dropped median OS to 2 months. Inferior OS was seen in VPC arm when compared to V arm (p=0.00616). Median PFS peaked at 11 months in VC arm versus 3 months for the VPC arm. Of 85 evaluable patients, 2 complete responses were noted in the V (n=25) and VPC (n=14) arms and 8 Partial Responses (PR) were noted with 5 (18%) patients with NSCLC in V arm followed by 4 PRs in the VC (n=12) arm. PR rates were equally seen in the other arms. ORR (36%) and CBR (40%) rates were the highest for the V arm. G3\/G4 treatment related adverse events with neutropenia (63%), thrombocytopenia (50%) and fatigue (63%) were highest in VPC. 1 patient died from G4 thrombocytopenia with intracranial hemorrhage in the VPC arm.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: No significant added clinical benefit was noted when vemurafenib was combined with other targeted agents or cytotoxic therapy. Combinations resulted in poor tolerance and need for dose reductions compromising clinical efficacy. Prospective studies to analyze resistance mechanisms to BRAF inhibitor therapy in BRAF+ tumors and in real time tailoring therapy based on co-occuring alterations is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bf73341f-775b-4a56-9dec-2ab8b9d5bd7e\/@w03B8ZUa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Combination therapy,Solid tumors,Outcome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18530"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"177a7b02-2823-4643-b964-ba547137b82a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/177a7b02-2823-4643-b964-ba547137b82a\/@w03B8ZUa\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Blessie Elizabeth Nelson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Roszik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filip Janku<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shumei Kato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aung Naing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarina Piha-Paul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siqing Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Apostolia Tsimberidou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Cabanillas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naifa Busaidy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Milind Javle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Byers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Heymach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Funda Meric-Bernstam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivek Subbiah<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, no targeted therapies have been developed for the large proportion of advanced NSCLC. We established a multi-institutional lung cancer genome screening platform (LC-SCRUM-Asia) to identify lung cancer patients with oncogenic drivers and to clinically develop molecular-targeted therapies. Here, we apply this platform to search for novel druggable oncogenic drivers in NSCLC.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> We performed transcriptome sequencing of non-squamous NSCLC samples negative for known oncogenic drivers in the LC-SCRUM-Asia cohort. The presence of gene fusion was validated by RT-PCR, <i>LTK<\/i> break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Sanger sequencing of gDNA and cDNA was performed to verify the breakpoint of these genes. The ability of oncogenic transformation was evaluated using NIH3T3 and Ba\/F3 cell models <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The efficacy of seven compounds developed as ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, entrectinib, lorlatinib, repotrectinib) were assessed.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of consecutive 75 samples analyzed, we identified a novel in-frame fusion transcript of <i>CLIP1<\/i> and <i>LTK<\/i> in a Japanese woman with lung adenocarcinoma.

Sanger sequencing verified the breakpoint in <i>CLIP1<\/i> intron16 and <i>LTK<\/i> exon10, resulting in fusion sequence of <i>CLIP1<\/i> exon16 to <i>LTK<\/i> exon11 in the expressed transcript. We show that kinase activity of CLIP1-LTK fusion protein is constitutively activated, along with phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, downstream of CLIP1-LTK, and has transformation potential dependent on LTK kinase activity. Treatment of Ba\/F3 cells expressing CLIP1-LTK with lorlatinib, an ALK inhibitor, inhibited phosphorylation of CLIP1-LTK, AKT, and ERK, suppressed proliferation, and induced apoptosis.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We identified the <i>CLIP1-LTK<\/i> fusion as a novel oncogenic driver in NSCLC, and the fusion protein can be targeted by lorlatinib.

While MET fusion-positive tumors can be sensitive to MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), to date no mechanisms of TKI resistance have been identified or characterized for MET fusion-positive disease.<br \/>Experimental Design: Serial targeted genomic sequencing (MSK-IMPACT) was performed in clinical samples from a MET fusion-positive NSCLC treated with the type Ia MET TKI crizotinib. Structural modeling and in vitro kinase assays were used to characterize crizotinib resistance and to test the activity of MET inhibitors with alternative binding modes.<br \/>Results: A novel MET G1090A resistance mutation was identified in a patient with a CD47-MET-rearranged NSCLC after crizotinib progression. In silico structural modeling and simulations indicated that the 2,6-dichloro-3-fluorophenyl moiety present on crizotinib directly binds to the side chain of the Y1230 residue in the activation loop of the MET wild type (WT) kinase. In the MET G1090A mutant kinase, the position of the Y1230 residue is predicted to be flipped roughly 180&#176;. As a result, the interaction between crizotinib and Y1230 is compromised; this in turn is predicted to reduce crizotinib&#8217;s binding affinity for the mutant kinase. Similar results were obtained when MET WT and G1090A mutant kinases were modeled in complex with selective type Ib MET TKI (i.e., capmatinib, savolitinib and tepotinib). Conversely, we found that type II agents (i.e., cabozantinib and foretinib) were not predicted to interact with Y1230. Therefore, their binding affinity to the mutant MET kinase was predicted to be retained. In vitro kinase assays performed using titrations of crizotinib and capmatinib (representative type I agents) and of cabozantinib (representative type II agent) showed that all three TKI were active against the MET WT kinase (calculated IC50 of 2.5nM, 3.89nM and 1.59nM, respectively). However, the calculated IC50 for crizotinib and capmatinib were 6.04- and 48.4-fold higher than the calculated IC50 for cabozantinib against the MET G1090A mutant kinase. Consistent with the prediction of type II inhibitor activity, the patient was transitioned to cabozantinib. A marked clinical, radiographic, and metabolic response was observed.<br \/>Conclusions: In MET fusion-positive cancers, the novel MET G1090A resistance mutation drives resistance to type I MET kinase inhibition. Drug binding mode switching to type II MET inhibition overcomes preclinical and clinical resistance, highlighting the need for further rational type II inhibitor development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8de2894b-7355-4478-b6d5-53c27cf9d031\/@w03B8ZUa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Fusion proteins,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18532"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"1df7eaa4-3732-4c8c-96cd-d9f8129f2bf3","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1df7eaa4-3732-4c8c-96cd-d9f8129f2bf3\/@w03B8ZUa\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yonina R.

However, studies typically utilize assays limited to a small set of genes that may miss biologically important and clinically actionable mutations. To address this limitation, we have developed a whole-exome scale cfDNA platform, NeXT Liquid Biopsy (NeXT LB), that enables sensitive identification of mutations in plasma across ~20,000 genes following interventions such as surgery and treatment therapies. NeXT LB monitors tumor variants and discovers novel mutations in the plasma through analysis of tumor, normal, and plasma samples from the same patient.<br \/>To enable sensitive detection across the exome in solid tumor and liquid biopsies, we developed an enhanced whole-exome assay and chemistry that augments challenging genomic regions to enable more uniform coverage across the exome. Additionally, we achieve a mean depth of coverage of ~2,000X across the exome, with boosted depth (~5,000X) for 247 clinically relevant oncogenic or tumor suppressor genes to further enhance sensitivity. Finally, we developed computational algorithms to sensitively monitor and discover somatic mutations in liquid biopsies without compromising specificity.<br \/>In this work, we measure the sensitivity of NeXT LB using SeraCare reference samples with known variants at 0.5%, 1%, and 2% allele fraction (AF). We observe 100% sensitivity at 2% and 1% AF, and &#62;95% sensitivity at 0.5% AF. Additionally, we measure &#62;95% sensitivity for variants with AF &#62;=2% using a proprietary cell-line media system.<br \/>We generate low-pass Whole Genome Sequencing (lpWGS) data to estimate ctDNA fraction in conjunction with NeXT LB. Considering tumor heterogeneity, NeXT LB is capable of monitoring and discovering somatic variants when lpWGS-reported ctDNA fraction is &#62;=3%, thereby highlighting the performance of the NeXT LB platform.<br \/>We apply NeXT LB to sequence over 100 matched plasma and normal samples at 250 gigabases (G) and tumors at 50 G. This data demonstrate somatic variation in over 1,000 distinct genes across the cohort, thereby demonstrating the breadth and performance improvements provided by our exome-scale platform in contrast to existing targeted platforms. Additionally, we find that the plasma variants are enriched for higher AFs in solid tumors, thus allowing comprehensive coverage of driver genes and recapitulating hotspots identified in public datasets, including TCGA.<br \/>We developed an exome-scale NeXT LB technology that enables sensitive monitoring and detection of somatic SNVs and indels from cfDNA. The NeXT LB platform covers a much broader landscape of tumor mutations from the plasma than existing targeted platforms, thereby enabling more comprehensive monitoring and discovery of mutations related to therapies, mechanisms of resistance, intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity, among others.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3505238e-fd5a-433c-a6ca-6834b81fab15\/@w03B8ZUa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,,Exome sequencing,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21565"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fabio C p Navarro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naveen Ramesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josette Northcott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee D.
