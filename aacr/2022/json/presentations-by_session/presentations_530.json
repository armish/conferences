[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Oncogenic <i>KRAS<\/i> is present in almost all cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, targeting KRAS or its canonical signaling cascades, especially the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, remains clinically unsuccessful. Targeting ERK kinases has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy and combinatorial strategies should be developed.<br \/><b>Aim: <\/b>Identify adaptive mechanisms to ERK inhibition that can be co-targeted to achieve effective tumor inhibition in multiple patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) was used in early-passage patient-derived cell lines (PDCLs) to identify potential resistance mechanisms. These were confirmed using RNA interference and overexpression in PDAC cell lines and PDCLs. The promising combinations were tested in 30 early-passaged PDAC PDXs.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>RPPA showed dramatic downregulation of DUSP4 and DUSP6 phosphatases following MEK and ERK inhibition, which coincided with upregulation of phospho-HER2 and -HER3. Knockdown of DUSP6, but not DUSP4, was sufficient in phosphorylation of HER2. Conversely, overexpression of DUSP6 curbed HER2 and ERK activation. Downregulation of DUSP4 and DUSP6 induced by ulixertinib, an ERK inhibitor now in clinical development, was reversed by bortezomib, suggesting DUSP4 and DUSP6 are proteosomally degraded. Combined ulixertinib plus PI3K inhibitor copanlisib, or pan-HER inhibitor afatinib slowed but did not arrest PDX tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>, and addition of gemcitabine was required to achieve tumor regression or durable growth arrest. Alternatively, ulixertinib or MEK inhibitor (trametinib) in combination with trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a), an anti-HER2 conjugated topoisomerase I inhibitor, were extremely effective, leading to complete and durable tumor regression for all tested PDX models. We showed that upregulation of HER2 expression following MEK or ERK inhibitor treatment provides a conduit for enhanced internalization of DS-8201a.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our study provided novel mechanistic insight on how PDAC cells evade MAPK inhibition via enhancing HER2 signaling. We demonstrated that the combination of MEK or ERK inhibitor plus DS-8201a is extremely effective, leading to complete tumor regression in multiple PDAC PDX models. This combination should be advanced as a clinical trial for PDAC patients.<br \/><b>Keys<\/b>: DS-8201a, DUSP6, HER2, KRAS, ulixertinib, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5fe3f4a4-89cc-4665-a90e-e2e79fa689c2\/@w03B8ZRd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Pancreatic cancer,KRAS,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17630"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ashenafi Shiferaw Bulle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kuljeet Seehar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sapana Bansod<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yali Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chen Hung-Po<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paarth B.

Recently, novel HER2-targeting agents are being developed after trastuzumab, and HER2-targeted therapies have been attempted in across solid tumor types, including biliary tract cancer. In these aspects, it is essential to understand and elucidate the resistant mechanism of the HER2-targeting strategies. Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcription factor of the Hippo pathway, function as proto-oncoproteins by inducing target genes involved in cancer cell survival and proliferation (Zhao B, et al. Genes Develop 2008). Also, YAP is emerging as a resistance mechanism of cytotoxic and targeted drugs. In this study, we explore the role of YAP in overcoming resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-positive cancer cells.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Four trastuzumab-resistant (HR) cell lines were established using HER2-postive gastric and biliary tract cancer cell lines (N87, SNU216, SNU2670, and SNU2773) (Jin MH, et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 2017). YAP siRNA and Verteporfin (YAP-TEAD inhibitor) were used to downregulate YAP. MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, western blot and migration assay were performed to analyze the antitumor effects through YAP downregulation. In order to elucidate tumor cell immune-modulation by YAP, human PBMC co-culture was used and immune markers, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), were analyzed in HR cell lines.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Increase of receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1\/2 (ROR1\/2) expression was observed in the HR cells. Relatively high expression of pYAP, YAP, and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) were observed in the HR cells (SNU216HR, SNU2670HR and SNU2773HR) compared to parental cells. Reducing overexpressed YAP in HR cells resulted in tumor cell growth inhibition. In cell cycle analysis, the increase of subG1 phase through YAP downregulation was observed, and cyclinD, B, A and BCL-XL were effectively decreased. Migration was also inhibited by the decrease in YAP expression. By verteporfin treatment, changes in immune markers including increase of CD80 and decrease of PD-L1 was found. In addition, p-STAT3 and IL6, Which regulate PD-L1, were also decreased through the reduction of YAP. In HR cells treated with siYAP, there was a tendency to increase CD8+ T cells upon PBMC co-culture.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> YAP is upregulated in trastuzumab-resistant (HR) cells and upregulated YAP induce PD-L1 expression. Inhibition of YAP shows anti-tumor effects and modulates immune status. Collectively, our results suggest that inhibition of YAP is one of promising strategies to overcome trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e9171891-61fa-407f-a68a-36e544cbffa9\/@w03B8ZRd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Yes-associated protein (YAP),Herceptin,Resistance,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17631"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ah Rong Nam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeesun Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyoung-Seok Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae-Min Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ju-Hee Bang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae-Yong Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Do-Youn Oh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Acquired resistance mechanisms are diverse because of tumor heterogeneity, which makes it difficult to overcome acquired resistance. Initial resistance is the resistance mechanism of tumor cells that survive the initial treatment. If we could overcome the initial resistance, we could prevent cancer cells from developing various types of acquired resistance. We are now focusing on YAP1 and cancer stem cells, which have been also reported as acquired resistance mechanisms in various types of cancers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> PC-9 cells and HCC827 cells which were EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer cell lines were mainly utilized in our experiments; they were purchased from ECACC and ATCC, respectively. We mainly utilized osimertinib as an EGFR-TKI and verteporfin as a YAP1 inhibitor. The nuclear translocation of YAP1 was confirmed by fluorescence immunostaining. siRNA was utilized to knock down YAP1. Cell viability assays were performed using CellTiter-Glo reagent. qRT-PCR was performed to confirm the gene expression of cancer stem cells.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> YAP1 is activated by nuclear translocation. In PC-9 cells, YAP1 was localized in the nucleus after osimertinib exposure. In contrast, YAP1 was localized in the nucleus of HCC827 cells before osimertinib exposure and remained in the nucleus even after osimertinib exposure. These data suggest that YAP1 activation is correlated with initial resistance. Cell viability assay showed that both PC-9 cells and HCC827 cells became more sensitive to osimertinib with the knocking down of YAP1. In addition, cell viability assays using PC-9 cells with verteporfin and osimertinib showed increased sensitivity to osimertinib. The gene expression of ALDH1A1 and SOX2 which are involved in cancer stem cells were increased in PC-9 cells after osimertinib exposure. On the other hand, the gene expression of ALDH1A1 was up-regulated but SOX2 was down-regulated in HCC827 cells after osimertinib exposure. We hypothesized that increased gene expression of cancer stem cells occurred downstream of YAP1 followed by initial resistance, thus we are currently confirming the gene alteration of cancer stem cells associated with osimertinib exposure with the knocking down YAP1. We are also considering the investigation of combination therapy of EGFR-TKIs and YAP1 inhibitors in vivo studies.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> YAP1 and cancer stem cells may be involved in initial resistance mechanisms to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer. Our results suggest that especially YAP1 can be a potential therapeutic target, thus we will continue additional studies of combination therapy of EGFR-TKIs and YAP1 inhibitors. In addition, we will continue to investigate whether the gene for cancer stem cells acts downstream of YAP1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/16ccff54-a88b-40b4-a22b-5766ce5942a9\/@w03B8ZRd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,EGFR TKI resistance,YAP1,Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17632"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tatsuya Ogimoto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroaki Ozasa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kentaro Hashimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Yoshida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazutaka Hosoya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masatoshi Yamazoe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hitomi Ajimizu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomoko Funazo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takahiro Tsuji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hironori Yoshida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryo Itotani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuichi Sakamori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toyohiro Hirai<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this study, we compare the mutational landscape of paired solid tumor samples before and after treatment in an effort to identify acquired events associated with resistance.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed whole-exome sequencing on 46 tumor and 23 whole blood samples from patients with stage IV gastric cancer were obtained from before treatment (n = 23) and at disease progression (PD) (n = 23). HER2 status was checked using immunohistochemistry and validated with florescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Correlation analysis was then conducted between the mutational profile and clinical data of patients.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Comparisons between innate resistance samples and acquired resistance samples at baseline revealed three copy number variation events (CDK12 amplification, ERBB2 amplification, MECOM amplification) that occurs in significantly different proportions (p &#60; 0.05).

Commonly acquired events (i.e., lacking in before treatment samples and present at PD) within patients include TP53 mutation, MYC amplification, MCL1 amplification, CDKN2A\/2B deletion, and CCNE1 amplification. Of these, patients with MCL1 gene amplification had worse survival (HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.2 - 20; p = 0.050) than patients with wild-type MCL1.

CCRF-CEM and ALL-SIL showed moderate sensitivity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 10-18 &#181;M) while Jurkat, MOLT16, MOLT4 and PF382 were resistant. Western blotting (WB) showed decreased levels of cIAP1and cIAP2 with no change in XIAP in response to tolinapant as a single agent.

Tolinapant sensitized SUP-T11 cells to DEX with ED<sub>50<\/sub> value of 542 nM in combination compared to ~2 &#181;M with DEX treatment. Simultaneous analysis of cell proliferation, stress response and DNA damage using single-cell proteomics analysis showed downregulation of proliferation (Ki-67), stress response (ATF4, LC3B) and increased levels of cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3 suggesting increased apoptosis in combination of tolinapant with DEX. Treatment of PDX-derived cells with tolinapant enhanced the cytotoxic effect of DEX in CD45+ bulk (58&#177;2% to 71&#177;0.1%, p&#60;0.0001) and LICs (62&#177;2% to 78&#177;0.9%, p&#60;0.0001).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Tolinapant synergizes with the anti-leukemic activity of ABT199 and DEX, establishing a therapeutic rationale for IAP antagonist in T-ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/edf81871-66f7-41c5-b064-c3f270e4cbc9\/@w03B8ZRd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,IAP,XIAP,Drug synergy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17634"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"71b42532-6c86-4dbd-8e60-618a11c0aec4","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71b42532-6c86-4dbd-8e60-618a11c0aec4\/@w03B8ZRd\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Priyanka Sharma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sujan Piya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huaxian Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalia Baran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Muharrem Muftuoglu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahesh Basyal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivian Ruvolo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Ward<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomoko Smyth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin J.

However, a key challenge facing these therapies is drug resistance caused by various mechanisms, one of which is the P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by the <i>ABCB1<\/i> gene) mediated multidrug resistance. Tumor cells with high P-gp protein expression extrude P-gp substrate drugs from intracellular space and reduce drug efficacy. Since Paclitaxel and some PARP inhibitors such as Olaparib are P-gp substrates, their clinical benefit may be compromised in primary or acquired P-gp positive patients. Pamiparib, on the other hand, is PARP inhibitor that is not P-gp substrate, therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Pamiparib will have better efficacy in P-gp high ovarian tumors.<br \/>To test this hypothesis, Paclitaxel or Olaparib acquired resistant cell lines were developed through prolonged <i>in vitro <\/i>culture of sensitive A2780 cells (P-gp negative) with stepwise increased concentrations of individual drug. Both Paclitaxel and Olaparib resistant cells (A2780pacR and A2780olaR, respectively) highly express P-gp protein and are cross-resistant to each other, indicating this acquired resistance is mediated by P-gp protein upregulation. Indeed, P-gp protein inhibitor Verapamil can largely restore sensitivity to Paclitaxel and Olaparib in A2780pacR and A2780olaR cells, while over-expression of P-gp protein into parental A2780 cell line recapitulated the resistant phenotype. In contrast to Paclitaxel and Olaparib, Pamiparib as non P-gp substrate, is equally sensitive to parental A2780, A2780pacR and A2780olaR cell lines and not affected by P-gp expression. Consistently, intracellular drug concentration of Pamiparib is equivalent in A2780 and A2780olaR cells, however, decreased cellular Olaparib was detected in resistant cell line. These findings have been further confirmed in Olaparib resistant CDX model, in which Pamiparib showed tumor growth inhibition while Olaparib did not. The results highly suggest that Pamiparib as a non-P-gp substrate PARP inhibitor can overcome <i>ABCB1<\/i>-mediated drug resistance in tumors and may provide additional clinical benefits to ovarian cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9339796a-6e23-443d-bd55-e92c15a2f898\/@w03B8ZRd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,PARP inhibitors,P-glycoprotein,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17635"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Minjuan Deng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kang Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhirong Shen<\/i><\/presenter>.

The JAK1\/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux) is standard of care in front line patients; however, JAK inhibition alone does not induce long-term remission or disease-modifying effects. The BCL-2 family pro-survival proteins BCL-X<sub>L<\/sub> and MCL-1 have been implicated in resistance to Rux, and combined activity between the BCL-X<sub>L<\/sub>\/BCL-2 inhibitor navitoclax (Nav) and JAK2 inhibition has been described in preclinical models. The combination of Nav + Rux resulted in clinically meaningful responses (e.g., improvements in spleen volume, constitutional symptoms, anemia, and bone marrow fibrosis) in patients with suboptimal response to, or progression while on, Rux (Harrison et al., EHA 2021, EP1087).<br \/>Nav does not have strong affinity for MCL-1 or BCL2A1. BCL2A1 has garnered recent attention given its potential role in tumor survival and drug resistance; however, its role in MF is unknown. Given the potential of Nav + Rux in MF, we evaluated the expression of BCL-2 pro-survival proteins, including BCL2A1, in MF patient specimens and assessed the ability of BCL2A1 to serve as a resistance factor to Nav + Rux <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/>DNA\/RNA was extracted from PBMCs from healthy donors (n=15), JAK1\/2-inhibitor na&#239;ve patients with MF (n=18), and suboptimal responders or progressors (R\/R MF) currently on stable dose of Rux (n=72). When compared to healthy donors, expression of <i>BCL2L1<\/i>, <i>MCL1<\/i> and <i>BCL2A1<\/i>, but not <i>BCL2<\/i>, was higher in na&#239;ve and R\/R MF patients, with greatest increase observed in <i>BCL2L1<\/i>. Increase in median expression in na&#239;ve patients vs healthy donors for <i>BCL2L1<\/i>, <i>MCL1<\/i>, and <i>BCL2A1<\/i> was ~4-, 1.5-, and 2-fold, respectively. A similar trend was observed with R\/R MF patients vs healthy donors. We next evaluated BCL-2 family expression in <i>in vitro<\/i> models of MPN. Notably, <i>MCL1<\/i> expression was high in UKE-1, SET-2 and HEL cell lines, while high expression of <i>BCL2A1<\/i> was only observed in UKE-1. The combination of Nav plus either Rux, fedratinib or momelitinib induced synergistic cell killing in all lines. These data suggest that although <i>MCL1<\/i> and <i>BCL2A1<\/i> are expressed in JAK2-mutated cells and other malignancies characterized by constitutive JAK\/STAT signaling, they do not confer resistance to a Nav + JAK-inhibitor combination.<br \/>In summary, our data demonstrate dysregulated pro-survival BCL-2 family member expression, including <i>MCL1<\/i> and <i>BCL2A1<\/i>, in MF patient samples and JAK2-mutated cell lines, and further implicate BCL-X<sub>L<\/sub> as a major survival factor in both na&#239;ve and Rux-treated R\/R MF patients. Together these data support a Nav\/JAK1\/2-inhibitor combination for both JAK1\/2-inhibitor na&#239;ve patients, as well as those no longer benefiting from Rux therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d3dbc467-9a5c-4d78-9b81-9873236fd719\/@w03B8ZRd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bcl-xL,Bcl-2 protein family,JAK2,navitoclax,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17636"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"82cd690b-dfb7-4f9d-b5c8-6e0e02907b29","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82cd690b-dfb7-4f9d-b5c8-6e0e02907b29\/@w03B8ZRd\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marion Refici<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ziping Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Riehm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Darren Phillips<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Souers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jason Harb<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, primary or acquired resistance to trastuzumab often compromises the efficacy and impairs patients&#8217; survival. Vacuole Membrane Protein-1(VMP1), a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, has been reported to induce chemotherapy resistance by promoting autophagy. Our preliminary study found that the expression of GATA Binding Protein 3(GATA3) and VMP1 are positively correlated in tissue samples from HER-2 positive breast cancer patients. GATA3 and VMP1 were significantly increased in both protein and mRNA levels in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines as compared to the sensitive counterparts. Furthermore, the expression autophagy signature protein P62 significantly decreased in trastuzumab-resistant cell lines, while the expression of autophagy activation protein ATG5 increased, indicating a close relationship between autophagy and trastuzumab resistance. In tissue samples from patients treated with neoadjuvant regiments containing trastuzumab, the expression of VMP1 significantly increased in the non-pCR (non-pathological complete response) group than the pCR group. Overexpression of VMP1 in wild-type breast cancer cells decreased their sensitivity to trastuzumab. On the contrary, when VMP1 was knocked-down in trastuzumab-resistance cells, the sensitivity of cell lines to trastuzumab was increased. Moreover, overexpressed GATA3 in wild-type HER-2 positive cell lines, the expression of VMP1 increased as well as the expression of ATG5, the signature protein of autophagy, suggesting that the transcription factor GATA3 may play a role in the transcriptional activation of VMP1. The promoter sequence was predicted, and it was found that GATA3 regulatory core sequence \"TGATA\" existed in front of the transcription start site from -327bp to -322bp, indicating that GATA3 may transcriptionally activate the expression of VMP1 and promote the occurrence of autophagy. TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) correlation analysis showed that, both VMP1 and GATA3 are positively correlated with classical autophagy related factors ATG2B, ATG7 and BCL1, indicating VMP1 and GATA3 may be involved in the positive regulation of autophagy in HER-2 positive breast cancer. Collectively, our results suggest that GATA3 transcriptionally activates VMP1 to promote autophagy, resulting in the induction of trastuzumab resistance in HER-2 positive breast cancer. Further mechanistic study on autophagy in contribution to trastuzumab resistance is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad2c3db5-4f32-40c3-a6ca-780f56d586dd\/@x03B8ZRe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Targeted therapy,Resistance,Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17637"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hao-yu Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-cui Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhen-hao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai-yuan Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>He-xing Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>De Zeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan-ke Liang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Among the 4 molecular MB subtypes, Group 3 and 4 MBs have the worst prognosis. The biology of recurrence and dissemination in MB is less understood. Overexpression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) has been associated with metastatic MB, and PDGFR activity promotes MB migration. PDGFR-induced migration is regulated by Src kinase. Src kinase activity is high in MB and Src kinase inhibition restricts tumor growth. Group 3 MB demonstrates high PDGFRA expression.<br \/><b>Aim: <\/b>Our objective was to evaluate if molecular inhibition of PDGFR or Src kinase will control metastatic progression\/dissemination in Group 3 MB.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We treated a panel of 4 patient-derived MB cell lines with dasatinib, which can inhibit BCRABL, c-KIT, PDGFR and Src kinase. Dasatinib dose required to inhibit c-KIT and PDGFR is higher (50-100 nM) than that needed for Src inhibition (1-10 nM).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Proliferation assay with dasatinib (1-10000nM) performed on all 4 cell lines did not demonstrate any inhibition of proliferation except at 10000nM dose. We treated all 4 MB cell lines with higher dose range of dasatinib (625-10000nM). One cell line did not respond to dasatinib, remaining cell lines demonstrated proliferation inhibition over 13 days between 625-5000nM. There were 2 interesting observations. Firstly, cell line which required lowest dose (625nM) was a recurrent MB, while paradoxically, its paired parental cell line (non-recurrent\/treatment-na&#239;ve) responded to proliferation inhibition only at higher 5000nM dose. IC<sub>50 <\/sub>of parental cell line was 38-times higher than recurrent cell line. We postulated that recurrent MB may be responsive to dasatinib. However, dasatinib-treated recurrent cells demonstrated minimal changes in cell cycle phases (IC<sub>50<\/sub> day 4 dose 187.4nM) and apoptotic cell death (187.4nM and 293.2nM) compared to DMSO-treated control. Since Group 3 MB demonstrates high PDGFRA expression, we employed a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of Group 3 MB to investigate the <i>in-vivo<\/i> response to dasatinib.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have emerged as a promising targeted therapeutic for TNBC patients with germline mutations in BRCA1\/2, recently demonstrating inhibition of micrometastatic disease. However, studies have also suggested that PARPi may have efficacy in TNBC, regardless of BRCA mutation status. We have previously identified a 63-gene signature associated with the DNA damage response to PARPi, with an overall accuracy of 86% in a cohort of patient-derived xenografts and a predicted sensitivity to PARPi in 45% of untreated TNBC patients. Additionally, our 63-gene signature can be used to identify genes implicated in intrinsic resistance. Therefore, we hypothesize that genes from our 63-gene signature can be used to identify potential targets for combination therapies with PARPi.<br \/>We selected six candidate genes from our 63-gene signature: <i>BARD1<\/i>, <i>BUB1<\/i>, <i>FEN1<\/i>, <i>RRM2<\/i>, <i>EXO1<\/i>, and <i>USP1<\/i>. For each of the selected genes, we performed siRNA knockdown experiments in MDAMB231, a TNBC cell line. Using flow cytometry, we found that talazoparib, a potent PARPi plus siBARD1, increased the proportion of cells in G2 phase, with 80% &#947;-H2AX-positive cells and 60% cleaved-caspase-3-positive cells. Interestingly, the DNA damage response was comparable to what was observed with the combination of talazoparib and carboplatin. Talazoparib + siBUB1 also induced DNA damage in 51% of cells (P&#60;0.001), and apoptosis in 20% of cells (P=0.002). Similar effects for enhanced DNA damage and apoptosis with talazoparib was observed for siUSP1, siFEN1, and siEXO1. Furthermore, the combination of siBARD1 + talazoparib resulted in a 49% reduction in cell migration in comparison to siBARD1 alone (P=0.0008), and the combination of siBUB1 and talazoparib demonstrated a 44% reduction in cell migration in comparison to talazoparib alone (P=0.04). Moreover, we evaluated gene expression in different breast cancer subtypes, and correlated with prognosis in a cohort of 881 untreated breast cancer patients. We found elevated expression of <i>RRM2, FEN1, <\/i>and<i> EXO1<\/i> amongst more aggressive breast cancer subtypes (basal and HER2), and that their overexpression were associated with a poorer 10-year distant metastasis-free survival (RRM2, P&#60;0.00001; FEN1, P=0.00012; EXO1, P&#60;0.00001). Taken together, genes from our 63-gene signature can be used to identify therapeutic targets that have demonstrated either enhanced DNA damage, cell death, or cell migration in combination with PARPi. With prognostic implications, these targets also demonstrate therapeutic potential in the clinic and warrant further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bef5ebe9-2280-4a86-b331-ad394f4ff627\/@x03B8ZRe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Combination therapy,PARP inhibitors,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17639"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Audrey Hubert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexia Cotte<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nelly Bechir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takrima Haque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Saima N.

Several ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK TKIs) have been approved for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) and are currently in clinical trials for NB therapy. Recent evidence reported that ALK TKI resistance can occur in cancer patients, making the long-term efficacy of these therapies challenging. With the use of high-throughput and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens, we identified loss of genes associated with decreased sensitivity to ALK TKIs in ALK-positive NB cells. Specifically, we discovered that CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of <i>miR-1304-5p<\/i> desensitises ALK-positive NB to the ALK TKIs brigatinib and ceritinib. Inhibition of <i>miR-1304-5p<\/i> decreased, while mimics increased the sensitivity of NB cells to these ALK TKIs. Furthermore, we showed that <i>miR-1304-5p<\/i> targets the RAS\/MAPK pathway, thereby decreasing cell viability via induction of apoptosis. Among the targets of <i>miR-1304-5p<\/i>, NRAS expression levels are of prognostic significance to NB patients suggesting it may drive an aggressive disease phenotype. Indeed, a combination treatment applying ALK TKIs and <i>miR-1304-5p<\/i> mimics increased treatment response. A similar effect was achieved using RAS pharmacological inhibition, which resulted in synergistic activity in MYCN Wild Type (WT) but had less effect on MYCN-amplified cells, suggesting that this pathway could be differentially regulated according to MYCN status. <i>miR-1304-5p<\/i> and <i>NRAS<\/i> expression, in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of high-risk NB harbouring ALK mutations, confirmed the relevance of this regulatory axis in NB and suggested that the reduced ALK TKI response in MYCN-positive PDXs could be due to inhibition of <i>miR-1304-5p<\/i>, and the combination of ALK and NRAS inhibition showed extraordinary anti-tumor efficacy compared to single agents. These findings suggest that the <i>miR-1304-5p\/NRAS<\/i> axis alters the sensitivity of NB to ALK inhibitors and suggest that the modulation of this pathway in combination with ALK inhibition is a promising approach to improve NB treatment response and ultimately patient survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ca8a7d4c-b219-42e6-bc33-2c565081ad3f\/@x03B8ZRe\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,MicroRNA,Ras,ALK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17641"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Perla Pucci<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liam Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne Turner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leila Jahangiri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamie Matthews<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amos Burke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Reynolds<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukas Kenner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olaf Merkel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fikret Rifatbegovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Ambros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>MiaoJun Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that are potent mutagens and carcinogens, and the investigators have taken advantage of these properties to investigate the mechanisms by which chemicals cause cancer of the skin and other organs. In comparison to C57Bl\/6 strain, C3H\/HeN mice are more susceptible to the development of PAH induced tumors. Therefore, a mouse model of nevus initiation and progression was developed in C3H\/HeN mice using a modified chemical carcinogenesis protocol.<br \/><b>Experimental Design:<\/b> In the traditional two-stage skin carcinogenesis model, initiation is accomplished by the application of a subcarcinogenic dose of a carcinogen. Subsequently, tumor development is elicited by repeated treatment with a tumor promoting agent. Nevi develop due to DNA damage initiated by 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) followed by chronic promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Dysplastic pigmented skin lesions appeared in ~10 wk with 100% penetrance. Studies reported here demonstrating that inhibition or depletion of RLIP results in apoptosis and cancer regression in an exceptionally broad spectrum on neoplasia have suggested an intriguing possibility that RLIP is an anti-apoptotic mechanism required not only for the survival of cancer cells, but also for their very existence. In support of this assertion results presented here that the well-known carcinogens, DMBA and phorbol esters (PMA or TPA) are ineffective in causing neoplasia in C3H\/HeN mice treated with RLIP-targeting agent&#8217;s (RLIP antibodies and RLIP antisense). Here we demonstrate that DMBA\/PMA-induced skin carcinogenesis in C3H\/HeN mouse was suppressed completely by depletion of RLIP by antisense or inhibition by antibodies. In addition, C3H\/HeN mice treated with RLIP-targeting agent&#8217;s, p53, P38, and JNK activation did not occur in response to carcinogens. These findings demonstrate a fundamental role of RLIP in chemical carcinogenesis.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We demonstrate that RLIP expression is significantly greater in cancer cells than in non-malignant cells, and RLIP-targeting agent&#8217;s (RLIP antibodies and RLIP antisense) treatment was significantly suppress the generation of melanocytic nevi and their progression to melanoma.

Metastatic BC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States, annually accounting for more than 40,100 deaths and 266,000 new cases of invasive BC. Amongst individual BC subtypes, those classified as TNBCs are especially lethal due to their highly metastatic behavior and propensity to recur rapidly. As a group, TNBCs lack expression of hormone receptors (ER-&#945; and PR) and ErbB2\/HER2, which has prevented the development of FDA-approved targeted drug therapies that are effective against this BC subtype. Likewise, recurrent TNBCs frequently acquire resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin, cyclophosphamides, and taxanes) through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. We established Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein-3 (WAVE3) as a novel promoter of TNBC development and metastatic progression. Our recently published studies have shown that WAVE3 phosphorylation regulates the interplay between PI3K, TGF-&#946;, and EGF signaling pathways. In this study, we show that WAVE3 phosphorylation promotes chemotherapy-resistance and cancer stemness in TNBC, both in vitro and in in vivo mouse models. CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated inactivation of WAVE3 resulted in inhibition of 2D growth and 3D tumorspheres&#8217; invasion of TNBC cells in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. In addition, while re-expression of phospho-active WAVE3 in the WAVE3-deficient TNBC cells restored the oncogenic activity of WAVE3, re-expression of phospho-mutant WAVE3 or the pharmacologic inhibition of WAVE3 phosphorylation did not. Further studies revealed that dual blocking WAVE3 expression or phosphorylation with chemotherapy treatment inhibited the activity and expression of &#946;-catenin. Importantly, a combination of WAVE3-deficiency and chemotherapy suppressed the oncogenic behavior of chemo-resistant TNBC cells, both in vitro and in vivo. This study suggests that a targeted therapeutic strategy against WAVE3 could be effective for the treatment of chemoresistant TNBC tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fc05530c-db68-45cf-884d-d39c15c74bdb\/@x03B8ZRe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),chemo-resistance,cancer stemness,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17643"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wei Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priyanka Rana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akram Alkrekshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vesna Markovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khalid Sossey-Alaoui<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the present study, we aimed to identify crucial genes in HCC cells that affect sorafenib resistance by a CRISPR\/Cas9 genome-scale screening. Among the candidates, two miRNAs, miR-15a and miR-20b, were finally identified as the essential sorafenib-sensitizing genes of HCC cells. In parallel, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay,colony formation assays and flow cytometric analysis were carried out to assess cell proliferation and survival, whereas tumor growth <i>in vivo <\/i>was assessed using xenograft models. The results indicated that the deficiency of miR-15a and miR-20b contributed to sorafenib resistance of HCC cells. By combination of various bioinformatics tools, Cell division cycle 37 like 1 (CDC37L1) was identified as a common target gene of miR-15a and miR-20b. Further cellular and molecular biology experiments demonstrated CDC37L1 was negatively regulated by the two miRNAs, and CDC37L1 could enhance sorafenib resistance of HCC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Mechanistically, we carried out SDS-PAGE and silver staining assays followed by mass spectrometry to analyze the immunoprecipitated proteins of CDC37L1. Our findings indicated that CDC37L1, as a cochaperone, effectively increased the expression of PPIA through strengthen the binding between HSP90 and PPIA. Additionally, CDC37L1 and PPIA expression were examined in a tissue microarray containing 80 pairs of HCC and normal tissues derived from patients who received sorafenib treatment via immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, the results revealed a positive association between CDC37L1 and PPIA expression, and high expression of CDC37L1 and PPIA predicted worse prognosis of HCC patients after sorafenib therapy. Taken together, our findings suggest that both miR-15a and miR-20b play sorafenib-sensitizing roles in HCC by facilitating the complex of CDC37L1\/HSP90\/PPIA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0d7ae96-5497-4992-87b5-979f0d1fd4c2\/@x03B8ZRe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Sorafenib,miR-15a,miR-20b,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17644"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Li Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shijun Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingde Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming Quan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yandong Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

The therapeutic potential of Wnt inhibitors appears promising in preclinical studies. However, they have uniformly failed clinical trials. How cancer cells develop Wnt inhibitor resistance is poorly understood. Current Wnt inhibitors are designed targeting either ligand or receptor. We hypothesized cancer cells will bypass ligand-receptor interaction through an unknown mechanism. We focused on the neurodevelopmental signaling program of Semaphorin 3C (Sema3C) that is upregulated in 85% of GBM and regulates glioma stem-cell-driven tumor progression.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed the expression of Sema3C and TCF1 expression pattern in 32 human GBM samples by immunohistochemistry. GSC self-renewal was assessed by extreme limiting dilution, Edu incorporation, tumorsphere formation and cell survival assays in Sema3C silencing GSCs. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence studies were performed to assess &#946;-catenin sub-cellular localization in GSCs. GSC-derived mouse models were assessed for survival.<br \/>Results: Porcupine inhibitor LGK974 reduced TCF1 expression in the GBM tumor mouse models, suggesting successful target engagement in vivo. However, it failed to prolong the overall survival. Sema3C expression strongly correlated with TCF1 expression in human GBM samples by immunohistochemical analysis. Genetic inhibition of Sema3C and TCF1 together prolonged animal survival more than either alone, indicating better control of Wnt pathway signaling with dual pathway blockade. Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation studies revealed that Sema3C signaling drove &#946;-catenin nuclear accumulation. Sema3C regulates transactivation of Wnt target genes including TCF1, c-Myc and c-Met. Sema3C pathway activates Rac1. It is reported that Rac1 activates &#946;-catenin and promotes &#946;-catenin nuclear accumulation. In GSCs, constitutively active Rac1 restored &#946;-catenin nuclear localization and rescued TCF1 and c-Myc down-regulation in the setting of Sema3C silencing. Sema3C can drive canonical Wnt signaling even when Wnt ligand secretion is blocked. Together, the data support that GSCs can escape Wnt inhibition through Sema3C and Rac1.<br \/>Conclusions: Sema3C signaling drives canonical Wnt signaling, providing an escape mechanism for cancer cells despite Wnt ligand-receptor interruption. Sema3C-&#946;-catenin signaling promotes GSC self-renewal and tumor progression. Upstream Wnt pathway inhibition alone is insufficient to control tumors. Our data provide a therapeutic strategy of dual blockade of Wnt and Sema3C pathways to provide clinically significant tumor control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b5fcc98c-8893-4e57-8816-39bb2e9d36cb\/@x03B8ZRe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,Semaphorin,Drug resistance,&#946;-catenin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17645"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jing Hao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In our current study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the longitudinal transcriptomic dynamics of lung cancer cells during the pyrotinib treatment, unraveling the potential resistance mechanisms. We treated a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, H358, with pyrotinib at doses of 100nM, 200nM, 500nM, and 1000nM every four days, respectively. Then, the untreated cells (P0) as well as longitudinal samples after each administration (P4, P8, P12, P16) were harvested for further analysis. After quality control, a total of 41,804 cells were sequenced and included for further analysis. The differentially expressed genes were determined using MAST and the differentially enriched cancer hallmark signatures based on single-sample Gene Set Variation Analysis (ssGSVA) were identified. The single-cell data revealed that the untreated cells (Sample P0) and persistent cells (Sample P16) had stable and distinct gene expression patterns, while cells during the course of treatment shared similar expression features at a transitional state. Several cancer driver genes were found to be aberrantly regulated during the administration, like <i>EPHA2<\/i>, <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, <i>CDK4<\/i>, <i>PTEN<\/i>, and <i>MYC<\/i>. Also, some pathways related to immune response were suppressed after pyrotinib treatment, including interferon alpha response, interferon gamma response, TNFA signaling via NF-&#954;B, and inflammatory response. Intriguingly, <i>CD274<\/i> (the gene encoding PD-L1) and <i>LGALS9 <\/i>were found to significantly decrease after pyrotinib treatment, suggesting that pyrotinib may be associated with outcomes of immunotherapy. With the large cell numbers analyzed, we distinguished an isolated, small subpopulation of cells characterized by the enriched expression of <i>MGP<\/i>,<i> COL1A1<\/i>,<i> COL1A2<\/i>,<i> SPARC<\/i>, and<i> COL3A1<\/i> along with the elevated EMT and angiogenesis scores, suggesting its critical role in pyrotinib resistance. Collectively, our study for the first time reveals the transcriptomic evolution of NSCLC cells in response to pyrotinib administration at the single-cell resolution, providing new insights into potential mechanisms of resistance to this novel regimen in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/08df2fe8-6d08-4ba7-8b47-eacfb7458676\/@x03B8ZRe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Drug resistance,Gene expression profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18576"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xinfeng Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Runsen Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie He<\/i><\/presenter>.

Importantly, Dara combination therapies can achieve high frequency and extent of response in both relapsed\/refractory and newly diagnosed MM. However, relapse of MM is commonly observed due, at least in part, to downregulation of CD38 on MM cells. Here we utilize genome-wide CRISPR-cas9 knockout (KO) screening to identify novel regulators mediating CD38 expression and Dara sensitivity in MM cells. We identified 46 different sgRNAs to be positively correlated with MM cytotoxicity triggered by Dara and NK cells treatment. We further performed second round screening using the cell population with lowest 5% CD38 expression after CRISPR lentiviral library transduction. Importantly, KDM6A was the top ranked of the overlapping genes from these two screenings. Next, we individually KO of <i>KDM6A<\/i> in MM cells and found that both mRNA and protein levels of CD38 were significantly decreased, as well as the cell surface CD38 expression detected by flow cytometry. Re-introduction of KDM6A into <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells restored the expression level of CD38 and Dara-induced cytotoxicity, indicating that KDM6A positively regulates CD38 expression in MM cells. Since KDM6A regulates demethylation of lysine 27 at histone H3 (H3K27) to activate gene expression, we next examined whether CD38 expression was altered by methylation status of H3K27. From our ChIP-seq and ChIP Q-PCR data, we identified that H3K27me3 level was highly enriched on the promotor area of CD38 in <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells compared to control cells. These data indicate that KDM6A modulates CD38 expression by regulating H3K27me3 level on the CD38 promotor, thereby mediating sensitivity of MM cells to Dara-induced cytotoxicity. H3K27me3 is regulated by the balance of demethylase (KDM6A) and methyltransferase (EZH2). However, downregulating H3K27me3 on the CD38 promoter by enhancing KDM6A activity is challenging. Therefore, we next explored whether EZH2 inhibitor can restore CD38 expression and overcome Dara resistance in <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells. Indeed, H3K27me3 level on the CD38 promotor area was significantly decreased by EZH2 inhibitor. Moreover, EZH2 inhibitor treatment upregulated both CD38 mRNA and protein levels in <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells. Importantly, EZH2 inhibitor also restored sensitivity of <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells to Dara-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that KDM6A regulates H3K27me3 level on CD38 promotor area and CD38 expression in MM. Moreover, we validate that combination treatment with EZH2 inhibitor and Dara can overcome Dara resistance in preclinical MM models, providing the rationale for combination clinical trials to overcome Dara resistance and improve patient outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c72db661-ddad-450e-b682-bd676d866910\/@y03B8ZRf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),CD38,Histone methylation,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18579"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiye Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lijie Xing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teru Hideshima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Carl Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>.

High response rates to osimertinib are observed in patients with activating EGFR mutations. However, there is variability in duration of response and patients eventually develop acquired resistance.Preclinical validation of potential acquired resistance mutations identified in relapsed patients treated with osimertinib is a key challenge to develop new strategies to improve outcomes for patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC. Tissue and ctDNA NGS analysis from relapsed patients treated first-line with osimertinib in the FLAURA and ORCHARD trials identified PIK3CA gain of function (GOF 11%) and PTEN loss of function (LOF 5%) mutations.To test whether PIK3CA activating mutations can drive resistance to osimertinib we introduced PIK3CA activating variants (PIK3CA-H1047R and PIK3CA-E453K) or knocked-out PTEN in NSCLC lung cancer cell lines harbouring EGFR activating mutations and WT PIK3CA\/PTEN using CRISPR\/Cas9 technology. Our results show that PIK3CA GOF and PTEN LOF mutations conferred resistance to osimertinib in vitro. Resistance was associated with increased EC50 for osimertinib and diminished apoptotic response in NSCLC PIK3CA GOF and PTEN LOF mutant CRISPR cell lines when compared to parental cells. Protein analysis by western blot also showed an increase in the basal and osimertinib treated levels of pAKT and pS6 in PIK3CA\/PTEN CRISPR engineered cell lines, indicating activation of downstream PI3K\/AKT and MAPK signalling pathways in the osimertinib-resistant cells. Importantly, our in vitro experiments from multiple cell line models indicated that PIK3CA-mediated resistance to osimertinib could be partially reversed by co-treatment with AKT (capivasertib, AstraZeneca) and PI3K alpha (alpelisib, Novartis) inhibitors; PTEN-mediated resistance could be rescued by co-treatment with capivasertib and PI3K beta (AZD8186, AstraZeneca) inhibitors. We next examined the in vivo efficacy of osimertinib + AKT\/PI3K inhibitors therapies in NSCLC xenograft models. Our in vivo analysis show that PIK3CA GOF CRISPR engineered cells displayed diminished response to osimertinib when implanted in mice; importantly, combination with AKT (capivasertib) or PI3K alpha (alpelisib) inhibitors enhanced response on treatment and delayed outgrowth after withdrawal treatment. In addition, we observed that combination treatment with capivasertib induced tumour stasis in a PIK3CA-E454K and two PTENloss PDX models.Altogether our in vitro and in vivo data provide evidence of PIK3CA mutants and PTEN loss-driven mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib and offer possible therapeutic combination strategies for those patients that develop resistance or experience a sub-optimal response to osimertinib through PIK3CA\/PTEN mutations","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4006f5cb-dfcc-48a1-b1b7-eca29aae7792\/@y03B8ZRf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PIK3CA,PTEN,EGFR TKI resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18580"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ursula Grazini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel J.

We developed osimertinib-acquired resistant H1975-OSIR (T790M\/L858R mutant) isogenic cells and TC386-OSIR isogenic PDXs. Neither H1975-OSIR nor TC386-OSIR PDXs developed additional mutations in EGFR. The H1975-OSIR clone showed 100 fold higher resistance to osimertinib compared with H1975 cells. TC386-OSIR PDX was developed through continuous in-vivo treatment for 8 months and the residual PDXs were passaged for several generations under continuous osimertinib treatment. TC386-OSIR fourth resistant generation (RG4) showed significantly higher resistance than initial generations (RG1). H1975-OSIR xenografts were developed in non-humanized and humanized NSG mice under osimertinib pressure. H1975-OsiR tumors were significantly less sensitive to osimertinib than their parental counterparts in both mouse models. Dose dependent antitumor activity of osimertinib (5mg\/kg and 10mg\/kg) was observed in H1975-parental tumors, whereas no treatment effect was observed for H1975-OsiR tumors with increasing doses. The tumor microenvironment was enriched with higher infiltration of tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and lower numbers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in H1975-OSIR vs H1975 tumors. RPPA analysis of residual tumor tissues showed a distinct set of proteins upregulated in H1975-OsiR vs H1975-parental, among which PDK1 was the most upregulated. PDK1 was also significantly upregulated in H1975-OsiR tumors treated with osimertinib vs controls. PDK1 was not altered in any treatment groups in H1975-parental tumors. PDK1 and pPDK1 expression was many-fold higher in both H1975-OSIR cells and TC386-OSIR PDXs as compared to their parental counterparts by western blot and mass spec proteomics. Selective inhibition by the PDK inhibitor, BX 795, and CRISPR knock-out (KO) restored osimertinib sensitivity in resistant cells. Colony forming assays showed that the PDK1 KO clone was as sensitive as H1975-parental cells whereas a PDK overexpressing clone (OE) restored resistance. In-vivo inhibition of PDK1 by treating mice with BX-795 in both H1975-OSIR xenografts and TC386-OSIR PDXs significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of osimertinib. PDK1 KO dysregulated PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling by downregulating Akt and mTOR phosphorylation and promoted cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. NCI-H1975-OSIR and PDK1 OE cells showed a high level of nuclear localization of the activated Yes-associated protein pYAP(Y357). PDK1 KO cells significantly reduced nuclear localization of pYAP(Y357). The level of YAP and pYAP was upregulated in osimertinib resistant xenograft tumors and residual tumor biopsies. Taken together, we identified PDK1 as a drug able target to treat osimertinib acquired resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/59120b61-e622-41b1-8888-4477c89f5bc7\/@y03B8ZRf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Osimertinib,EGFR TKI resistance,PDK1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18581"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ismail M.

NSCLC with <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 20 insertions is resistance to conventional epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as osimertinib. CLN-081 is a novel EGFR-TKI which shows promising anti-tumor activity for <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 20 insertions in an ongoing clinical trial. However, previous studies of other EGFR-TKIs prompted us to hypothesize that tumors would acquire resistance to CLN-081 over time. Investigation of the mechanisms of resistance to CLN-081 will provide novel therapeutic strategies for patients with CLN-081-resistant NSCLC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We first generated Ba\/F3 cells stably expressing <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 20 insertions (Ba\/F3-A767_S768insSVD and Ba\/F3-Y764_V765insHH) and human patient-derived cells (PDCs), BID007 and BID019 harboring A763_Y764insFQEA and N771_P772insH, respectively.

About half of melanomas have the presence of the BRAFV600E oncoprotein, which leads to hyperactivation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The MAPK pathway is known to crosstalk with the PI3K\/Akt pathway. Treatment with the BRAF inhibitor, Dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor, Trametinib is limited as patient responses begin to drop due to acquired resistance to these kinase inhibitors. High concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accompany this resistance. ROS-induced drug release (RIDR)-PI-103 is a novel prodrug with a self-cyclizing moiety linked to PI-103, a PI3K inhibitor. Under high ROS conditions, RIDR-PI-103 releases PI-103, which inhibits conversion of PIP<sub>2<\/sub> to PIP<sub>3<\/sub>. We have generated Trametinib and Dabrafenib resistant (TDR) cells for 3 BRAF-mutant cell lines: A375, WM115 and WM983B from parental (drug sensitive) cell lines. Studies in our lab demonstrate that TDR cells maintain p-Akt levels compared to parental counterparts and have significantly higher ROS. This is a rationale to explore the efficacy RIDR-PI-103 in TDR cells. We tested the effect of RIDR-PI-103 on cell viability for 1789C melanocytes, 1788B melanocytes, A375 TDR, WM983B TDR, and WM115 TDR using an MTT proliferation assay. RIDR-PI-103 exhibited less toxicity as compared to PI-103 at 5 &#181;M in normal melanocytes. While RIDR-PI-103 significantly inhibited TDR cell proliferation at 5 and 10 &#181;M compared to cells treated with vehicle DMSO and melanocytes. This effect was consistent when TDR cells were treated with RIDR-PI-103 in long-term crystal violet cell proliferation assays. WM115 TDR and WM983B TDR cells were highly sensitive to RIDR-PI-103 at 5 &#181;M, while A375 TDR cells had only ~50% inhibition at 5 &#181;M in both cell proliferation assays. 24 hour treatment with RIDR-PI-103 inhibited p-Akt (S473) along with downstream p-S6 (S240\/244) and p-S6 (235\/236). To examine the mechanism of action of RIDR-PI-103 and to test that the drug release is ROS induced, we assessed the effect of glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant on the TDR cells in the presence or absence of RIDR-PI-103. GSH alone did not affect proliferation of TDR cells. Addition of GSH to RIDR-PI-103 significantly rescued the cell proliferation in all three TDR cell lines. We next tested the effect of t-butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP), a ROS inducer on TDR cells with lower concentrations of RIDR-PI-103. Addition of TBHP to RIDR-PI-103 significantly induced proliferation in TDR cells. Ongoing experiments are focused on assessing the effect of RIDR-PI-103 on the mTOR pathway. Examining the efficacy of RIDR-PI-103 on BRAF and MEK inhibitor resistant cells will expand possible treatment options and open up avenues for the development of new treatment therapies for BRAF-mutant melanoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ce6cc164-3857-4de6-be22-a567ff935f08\/@y03B8ZRf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Reactive oxygen species,Resistance,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18583"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hima Patel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosalin Mishra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Wier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nazanin Mokhtarpour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edward J.

However, classic allosteric mTOR inhibitors rapamycin only exerts limited clinical benefits. It has been shown that prostate cancer are able to acquire resistance after rapamycin treatment for a period of time. Such secondary resistance remains as major concerns in rapamycin-based anti-cancer therapies that may inevitably lead to therapeutic failure. In the current study, we evaluated treatment effects of ATP-competitive dual mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 on cancer cells that have acquired resistance to rapamycin, and underpinning molecular mechanisms. To establish cells with acquired rapamycin resistance, PTEN-<i>mt<\/i> prostate cancer PC-3 cells were gradually treated with increasing concentrations of rapamycin (up to 10 &#956;M) until the cells were completely unresponsive to rapamycin (PC-3RR). Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay and clonogenic survival was tested by colony formation assay. m<sup>7<\/sup>G pull-down assay was employed to detect the cap-dependent translation. mTOR downstream pathways, including p-S6K (T389)\/p-S6 (S235\/236), p-4EBP1 (T37\/S46) and p-Akt (S473) were detected by Western Blotting. PC-3RR cells essentially failed to respond to rapamycin, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values greater than 1 &#956;M. However, AZD8055 suppressed PC-3RR proliferation in a dose dependent manner, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 30 nM. Similarly, clonogenic capacity was impaired by AZD8055 to a greater extent than was the case for rapamycin. At the molecular level, AZD8055, but not rapamycin, strongly prevents the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E. Further, while the p-S6K and p-S6 pathway was potently inhibited by both agents, AZD8055 displayed more striking inhibition on p-4E-BP1 and p-Akt than rapamycin. Interestingly, similar to rapamycin, AZD8055 slightly increased p-Akt (T308), suggesting the existence of the PI3K-mediated feedback loop. These findings indicate that AZD8055 significantly inhibits malignant functions in cancer cells that are highly resistant to rapamycin. Such effects are likely to be associated with the deactivation of rapamycin-insensitive mTOR downstream pathways. These data provide preliminary evidence for future evaluation of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors in cancer models that are resistant to rapamycin analogs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2cbda4d-4d3c-4d1c-b327-606313688efd\/@y03B8ZRf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,Resistance,Rapamycin,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18584"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yao Dai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dietmar Siemann<\/i><\/presenter>.

Approximately, 60% of patients receiving enzalutamide show initial remission followedby disease relapse with the emergence of highly aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer.Solute carrier (SLC) transporters play a critical role in cancer drug resistance by altering cellularmetabolism. We have recently reported the predominance of SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 duringenzalutamide resistance (Cells 9(12):2535, 2020) by generating enzalutamide resistant (C4-2B-Enzu) cells exposing human prostate cancer C4-2B cells in the presence of increasingconcentration of enzalutamide (1-20 &#181;M) and maintained in the same condition for six months.However, the role of these molecules during metabolic reprogramming have not beenelucidated. Knockdown of SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 gene by sgRNA transfection suppressedcell proliferation, and migration in C4-2B-Enzu cells. Analysis of cell cycle showed that in theabsence of SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 there is induction of G1\/S cell cycle arrest and reductionin the protein expression of checkpoint factors viz. Cyclin D1, CDK6, CDK4, and CDK2.SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 knockdown resulted in downregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase(ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and Acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 5(ACSL5) with simultaneous decrease in the levels of lactic acid, triglyceride and citric acid in C4-2B-Enzu cells. In addition, SLC25A17 knockdown resulted in marked increase in apoptosis asevident by increase in protein expression of RIPK3 and BAX, compared to SLC27A6 knockdownin C4-2B-Enzu cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that solute carriers SLC25A17and SLC27A6 play an important role in the development of enzalutamide resistance throughmetabolic reprogramming and loss of these molecules results in cell death. Thus, SLC25A17and SLC27A6 may serve as a therapeutic target for enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d14b6049-450e-4d07-9601-bd78b41f6d8b\/@y03B8ZRf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate,Metabolism,Signaling,Androgen deprivation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18585"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Prem P.

Development of resistance to platinum (Pt) is a major clinical problem and understanding its underpinnings will help find new approaches to overcome it. Fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) is a N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6<\/sup>A) demethylase and plays an important role regulating how the messenger RNA is processed translating into functional proteins. We recently showed that m<sup>6<\/sup>A modifications induced by FTO play a suppressive role in tumorigenicity and survival of OC stem cells. Here we hypothesized that RNA modifications caused by FTO regulate the response of OC cells to Pt.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To study the mechanisms related to FTO implicated in response to Pt; we used OC cells in which FTO was knocked down (KD) via shRNA or overexpressed (OE). Additionally, Pt-resistant (Pt-R) OC cells were obtained through repeated (3-4) exposures to Pt. Cell viability assay determined the IC<sub>50<\/sub> (half maximal inhibitory concentration) to Pt. Pt response in vivo was assessed in FTO expressing vs. FTO KD xenografts. Induction of DNA damage was assessed by immunofluorescence (IF) for &#947;-H2AX. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V staining in the IncuCyte system. To identify potential targets of FTO-mediated m<sup>6<\/sup>A modifications in Pt induced response, RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq were integrated.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>FTO was significantly downregulated in Pt-R vs. sensitive OC cells. Forced expression of FTO increased sensitivity to Pt in <i>vitro<\/i> and in <i>vivo, <\/i>while FTO KD<i> <\/i>increased Pt resistance<i> (p&#60;0.05)<\/i>. A catalytic mutant FTO did not appreciably alter responsiveness to Pt. Increased &#947;-H2AX foci and increased apoptosis were observed after exposure to Pt in FTO OE vs. control cells. Through integrated RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq, we identified and validated several potential targets involved in response to Pt including IER5, IER5, ST3Gal, and the enzyme nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). NNMT was upregulated and significantly hypomethylated in FTO OE cells and was downregulated in Pt resistant cells. Treatment with an NNMT inhibitor rescued the FTO induced sensitivity to Pt in OC cells demonstrating that its function is necessary in the response to Pt.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We identified a new function of FTO-dependent m<sup>6<\/sup>A RNA modifications in regulating response to Pt through NNMT, a novel RNA methylated target.

NRF2 is an important transcript factor involved in chemotherapy resistance due to its ability to regulate genes related to the antioxidant response and to prevent cell death processes, such as ferroptosis. However, the relation between NRF2 and iron-dependent cell death is contradictory and poorly understood. This study aimed to analyze the role of NRF2 in ferroptosis modulation in glioblastoma cells. To this end, it was analyzed two human glioblastoma cell lines (U251MG and T98G) after treatment with TMZ, ferroptosis inducers (Erastin, RSL3, and Sorafenib), and ferroptosis inhibitor (Ferrostatin-1). Also, we performed gene expression analysis of glioma patients. Our results demonstrated that T98G compared to the U251MG was more resistant to chemotherapy and showed elevated levels of NRF2 expression and its targets xCT, HMOX1, and ABCC1. Interestingly, T98G cells revealed higher sensitivity and lipoperoxidation levels after ferroptotic treatment. Next, we established T98G NRF2 silenced cells and we observed a significant reduction in cellular viability after TMZ treatment when compared to wild-type cells. On the other hand, T98G-shNRF2 was more resistant to ferroptosis induction, indicating that NRF2 plays a key role in the modulation of chemoresistance and ferroptosis. After, we showed that NRF2 controls levels of ABCC1\/MRP1 in glioblastoma cells, and ABCC1 silencing promotes sensitivity to TMZ and resistance to Erastin. These results support a possible mechanism of ferroptosis modulation by NRF2 on TMZ-resistant gliomas through ABCC1, which has been recently associated with ferroptosis induction by promoting efflux of glutathione out of the cell. Furthermore, we confirmed that NRF2 has a positive correlation with ABCC1 in glioma patients, and higher ABCC1 expression was associated with tumor aggressiveness. Also, we validated ABCC1 as an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival on glioma. Finally, we observed that T98G cells have sensitivity to the ferroptosis inducer FDA-approved, sorafenib. Altogether our data suggest that high levels of NRF2 may result in ferroptosis sensitivity on glioblastoma through the high levels of expression of its pro-ferroptotic target ABCC1, once the xCT system is blocked by Erastin. Thus, glioblastoma cell vulnerability to ferroptosis by NRF2 and ABCC1 high expression can be an Achilles&#8217; heel to reverse drug resistance on glioblastoma through the treatment with ferroptosis inducers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e3bc1fa0-e432-4da2-a7a0-847d45794854\/@y03B8ZRf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Drug resistance,Temozolomide,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18587"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Izadora De Souza<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linda Karolynne Seregni Monteiro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camila Banca Guedes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcela Teatin Latancia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Tomaz Andrade<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matheus Molina Silva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruna Contieri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruna Felício Milazzotto Maldonado Porchia Ribeiro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariana Lazarini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luciana Rodrigues Gomes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clarissa Ribeiro Reily Rocha<\/i><\/presenter>.

The poor prognosis of this disease is due in part to tumor recurrence and temozolomide (TMZ) resistance, for which PI3K\/AKT pathway overactivation has been implicated. Our work is to demonstrate that p110&#946; inhibition could represent a therapeutic target in sensitizing recurrent tumors to TMZ therapy, and demonstrate the utility of personalized GBM treatments.<br \/><b>Objective: <\/b>We aim to develop a more effective treatment for TMZ resistant GBM patients. We hypothesize that a p110&#946; inhibitor will sensitize resistant GBM cell lines to TMZ therapy. We intend to support this hypothesis by demonstrating that the p110&#946; inhibitor TGX-221 in combination with TMZ will provide a significantly greater level of cytotoxicity on TMZ resistant GBM cell lines than TGX-221 or TMZ monotherapy alone. We also intend to provide further evidence for this therapy by utilizing it to overcome TMZ resistance in glioblastoma stem cells (GSC&#8217;s).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We compared the cytotoxicity of TMZ, TGX-221, and a TMZ\/TGX-221 combination therapy on p110&#946;-high\/TMZ resistant and p110&#946;-low\/TMZ sensitive GBM cell lines. Cell viability was determined using the MTS assay. We then tested these reagents on normal human astrocytes to determine any potential dose-limiting off-target effects. Lastly, we tested these reagents using human-derived GSC&#8217;s.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A statistically significant difference (p &#60; 0.01) in cell viability was found using the TMZ\/TGX-221 combination therapy as compared to either TMZ or TGX-221 alone in our TMZ resistant SF295 cells, and a significant different was found between the combination therapy and TMZ monotherapy in our TMZ resistant U87MG cells. No significant difference was found between treatments in our TMZ sensitive A172 cells or normal human astrocytes.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The results of our GBM cell line experiments provide support that combination TMZ\/TGX-211 is superior in cytotoxicity to either monotherapy alone in TMZ resistant cell lines. This indicates that TGX-211, through p110&#946; inhibition, is able to sensitize resistant cell lines to TMZ therapy. More experiments are ongoing to determine if this effect will also be demonstrated in human-derived GSC&#8217;s.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b27c7aed-ea33-4b91-ab75-911957b59daf\/@y03B8ZRf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Temozolomide,PI3K,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18589"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marc R.

The major effectors of the Hippo pathway are the TEAD transcription factors, which become transcriptionally activated upon YAP\/TAZ binding. Genetic alterations of pathway components have been reported in a variety of human malignancies, resulting in YAP\/TAZ constitutive nuclear localization and TEAD activation. The TEAD transcription factors have been shown to autopalmitoylate, and palmitoylation is required for its interaction with YAP\/TAZ and hence activation of transcriptional activity. We have identified potent, selective, and orally available small molecule compounds that directly interact with TEAD and block its autopalmitoylation (Tang <i>et al<\/i>, 2021, <i>Mol Cancer Ther<\/i>. 20(6):986-998). These TEAD inhibitors disrupt YAP\/TAZ-TEAD protein interaction, suppress TEAD transcriptional activity, and selectively block proliferation of <i>NF2<\/i>-deficient mesothelioma <i>in vitro<\/i> and inhibit <i>NF2<\/i> mutant xenograft tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Nuclear YAP accumulation and functional requirement have also been linked to resistance to targeted therapies and cancer relapse in <i>BRAF<\/i>-mutant, <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant, <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant, and <i>ALK<\/i>-rearranged non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Hence, as TEAD transcription factors are the main drivers for YAP\/TAZ recruitment to chromatin, we evaluated the effect of our TEAD inhibitor VT3989, currently in clinical testing, on emerging drug tolerant persistent cancer cells and drug resistance during EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib treatment in combination studies.

Drug repositioning is being pursued as an attractive approach due to its potentially lower overall development costs and shorter timelines. The purpose of this study is to investigate the preclinical efficacy and mechanism of action of nicardipine, an FDA-approved hypertension drug, as a new treatment against chemoresistant prostate cancer.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A panel of FDA-approved non-oncology drugs was screened for their selectivity and potency to inhibit chemoresistant PCa cells using a two-tier phenotypic screening platform (Theranostics, 2021, 11(14): 6873-6890). The mechanism of action of potential candidate(s) was evaluated using in silico docking, cellular and molecular assays in ARCaP<sub>E<\/sub>-shEPLIN and C4-2B-TaxR, two independent chemoresistant PCa cell lines. The<i> in vivo <\/i>efficacy was evaluated in clinically-relevant xenograft models of PCa.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Nicardipine exhibited high selectivity and potency against chemoresistant PCa cells via effectively inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> of nicardipine was determined as 0.5 &#956;M and 2.1 &#956;M in ARCaP<sub>E<\/sub>-shEPLIN and C4-2B-TaxR cells, respectively. Mechanically, nicardipine targeted a novel non-canonical enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) signal pathway in chemoresistant PCa cells. Specifically, nicardipine might bind embryonic ectoderm development (EED), interrupt the integrity and stability of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), reduce the phosphorylation and expression of EZH2, and subsequently inhibit downstream effectors including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), ATP binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) and survivin. In animal models, as a monotherapy, nicardipine significantly suppressed the intratibial growth of chemoresistant C4-2B-TaxR xenografts, with an average PSA level of 43.47 ng\/ml, 36.63 ng\/ml, and 28.78 ng\/ml for the vehicle control, docetaxel, and nicardipine groups at the endpoint, respectively (<i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.05 between the nicardipine group and the vehicle control or docetaxel groups).

Unfortunately, only ~50% of treated patients will respond to therapy. While FDA approved for first-line therapy, these agents are seldom used, significantly limiting their utility. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop additional biomarkers to identify EGFRi sensitive patients. Using an innovative hybrid approach fusing gene expression and DNA sequencing, we recently reported that combined mutations in <i>APC<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i>, two major tumor suppressor genes, were strongly correlated with a validated gene expression signature measuring cetuximab sensitivity (CTX-S) in 468 CRC human tumors (Yang et al. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. <\/i>2019). Further analysis reported that <i>APC<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> mutations predict cetuximab sensitivity across consensus molecular subtypes (CMS1-4) (Thota et al. <i>Cancers.<\/i> 2021). While <i>APC<\/i> truncated mutations are known to mediate WNT pathway activation, one of key features of CMS2 CRCs reported to be associated with cetuximab response, little is known about <i>TP53<\/i> mutations with cetuximab sensitivity. To investigate a contributive role of mutant <i>TP53 in vitro<\/i>, we stably transfected expression plasmids of three hotspot mutations (R175H, R248W, R273H) of <i>TP53 <\/i>in <i>APC<\/i>-mutated CRC cells such as SW48<i> <\/i>cells harboring WT <i>KRAS\/NRAS<\/i>. Multiple stable clones for each of three <i>TP53<\/i> mutations (empty vector as a control) were selected for biochemical and RNASeq analyses. We found that the three oncogenic mutations of <i>TP53<\/i> enhanced cetuximab-mediated apoptosis under low serum culture conditions (2% FBS). Interestingly, the enhanced drug effect was associated with altered p53 pathway signatures as assessed by RNASeq. In support of the role of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations, siRNA-knockdown of <i>TP53<\/i> in SW48 cells also demonstrated an increased sensitivity to cetuximab treatments.

Initially, most patients diagnosed with SCLC respond to platinum + etoposide (PE)-based therapy, but relapse occurs in nearly all patients and is fatal. SCLC is a cancer with a heavy mutational burden, and loss-of-function mutations of the tumor suppressor genes <i>RB1<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> are nearly ubiquitous in SCLC tumors. Amplification and overexpression of the <i>MYC<\/i> of oncogene occurs in a subset of SCLC tumors that are associated with tumor progression, treatment resistance, and poor outcomes, therefore we pursued the inhibition of the <i>MYC<\/i> activation. The purpose of this study is to inhibit a novel pathway of <i>MYC<\/i> transcriptional activation via DNA-PKcs-mediated phosphorylation of OCT4 at its Ser93 residue in SCLC, a <i>MYC<\/i> transcriptional activation pathway that we discovered. We identified OCT4 being a transcription factor that primarily induce <i>MYC<\/i> activation. Subsequently, Serine 93 residue of OCT4, a new OCT-4 binding site, was phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs that was a critical step for OCT4-induced <i>MYC<\/i> activation. In a panel of 19 small cell lung cancer, DNA-PKcs, phosphorylation of OCT4 at Ser93, and c-MYC were positively correlated. We confirmed the binding of DNA-PKcs to OCT4 and identified novel OCT4-binding sites in the <i>MYC<\/i> promoter\/enhancer region that regulated <i>MYC<\/i> expression via phosphorylation by DNA-PKcs, and DNA-PKcs or OCT4 knockdown decreased c-MYC expression. DNA-PKcs inhibitors also reduced phosphorylation of OCT4 at Ser93 leading to decreases in c-MYC and showed cytotoxic effects via inducing apoptosis by DNA-PKcs inhibitors. DNA-PKcs inhibitors augments antitumor activity of Bcl-2 inhibitors cell lines and xenograft models of small cell lung cancer. In conclusion, report here that DNA-PKcs-mediated phosphorylation of OCT4 at Ser93 is a novel mechanism for activating the <i>MYC<\/i> oncogene in SCLC, and that DNA-PKcs is a viable target to decrease c-MYC expression in these highly aggressive tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/60a0ed7c-f5a4-493b-8d74-2ba20bc54d4e\/@z03B8ZRg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"c-Myc,DNA-PKcs,OCT4,Small cell lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18594"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Inhyoung Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ismail Mohiuddin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung-Jen Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martinez Gloria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min H.

We found that this metabolic switch happens primarily in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs), an &#8220;activated&#8221; phenotype associated with bad outcomes in cancer. We show that spatially distinct CAFs harvested from the tumor edge (Tumor-Adjacent-Fibroblasts; TAFs) of LUAD specimens vs the tumor core (Tumor Core Fibroblasts; TCFs) successfully protect cancer cells from erlotinib treatment, as measured by proliferation (ki67), migration (podoplanin) and resistance (Multidrug Resistance 1; MDR1) markers. However, while TCFs increase O-GlcNAcylation in cancer cells, a type of dynamic O-glycosylation, TAFs decrease O-GlcNAcylation in a subpopulation of cells. Interestingly, this subpopulation of cancer cells shows an increase of partial EMT features, as well as proliferation. In addition, we find this population of cancer cells to overexpress the MDR1 transporter, known to actively export erlotinib outside the cell. These results were reproduced in a novel in vitro assembloid model using patient-derived organoids and primary fibroblast mixtures that allow us to characterize cancer and spatially distinct stromal cells in response to erlotinib treatment. Overall, our preliminary results show that TAFs from the invasive leading edge of lung tumors decrease O-GlcNAcylation in cancer cells, which promotes erlotinib resistance. In summary, O-GlcNAcylation represents a potential avenue to mitigate resistance induced by tumor-stroma crosstalk and improve cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/de6ae245-7c8a-4811-907c-cf12c7d70ab7\/@z03B8ZRg\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Erlotinib,Glycosylation,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18595"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gina Bouchard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvia K.

About 85% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TP53 is an important tumor-suppressor and about 50% of human lung NSCLCs contain a mutant TP53. Targeting of mutant p53 is very limited due to the lack of drugs. PRIMA-1 is a first in class anti-mutant TP53 molecule with the ability to induce apoptosis by restoring the wild-type function of TP53 through covalently binding and modifying thiol groups in the central domain of the mutated protein. Recently, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to the PRIMA-1 methylated analog, APR-246 in combination with azacytidine for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and a TP53 mutation. The major setback of targeted therapy today continues to be resistance. Herein, we report our findings related to resistance to PRIMA-1 targeted therapy in spontaneous P53 mutant driven NSCLC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We have previously reported the generation of a line of transgenic mice with a human mutant p53(273H) expressed in a lung-specific manner. Human mutant TP53 expression was regulated under the transcriptional control of the human surfactant protein C (SP-C) promoter. After the age of 12 months, the mice developed spontaneous lung adenocarcinomas. We treated SPC-p53-273H lung tumor mice via intraperitoneal injection (i.p) with PRIMA-1 at a dose of 100 mg\/kg in 0.2 mL PBS every other day for two weeks. The tumors were identified using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) system and pre-and post-treatment diameters were estimated based on the CT image. K-ras status was analyzed by PCR-based Sanger sequencing.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of the 10 lung tumor-bearing mice treated with PRIMA-1, micro-CT derived sum of the largest diameters indicated that six mice (60%) experienced tumor volume reductions whereas four mice experienced tumor volume increase. Sequencing analysis showed five tumors contained K-ras mutations (two p.G12D, one p.G12F, one p.G12V and one p.Q61L). On average, lung tumor diameter had a 31% reduction post-treatment of PRIMA-1 for the lung tumors containing wild-type K-ras gene. Whereas it increased 18% on the average post-treatment of PRIMA-1 for the lung tumors containing a mutant K-ras gene. There is a significant difference statistically (p = 0.016) in the response to the treatment of PRIMA-1 between the mutant K-ras cohort and the wild-type K-ras cohort.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> PRIMA 1 therapy results in antitumor activity against P53 mutant lung tumors. However, the presence of K-ras co-mutation is a significant resistance factor. Combination of APR-246 and K-ras inhibitor therapy would be needed to overcome this resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bef9c18e-f380-4006-8403-f0ec66bfa2ff\/@z03B8ZRg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,KRAS,Resistance,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19018"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David T.

However, resistance to PARP inhibitor occurs frequently in patients with advanced stage and recurrent. The receptor tyrosine kinase cMET, which is frequently overexpressed in EOC associates with PARP1 activity and cell survival pathway. Therefore, we investigated whether the combination of olaparib and savolitinib, a novel cMET inhibitor, could overcome PARP inhibitor resistance on resistant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Tumor tissues were obtained from patients with EOC operated at department of obstetrics and gynecology, Asan medical center, Seoul, South Korea. BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated and cMET overexpressed tumors were selected and used for animal experiments. The tumor tissues were subcutaneous transplanted into right flank of NOD-scid IL2Rgamma<sup>null<\/sup> (NSG) mice. 60~90 days after transplantation, olaparib was administrated (80~100 mg\/kg, daily, P.O.). Tumors were inhibited until volume decreased to 0~50 mm<sup>3<\/sup>. When the tumor volume was reached under 50 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, administration was stopped and tumors were allowed to regrowth. After tumor regrowth, to confirm resistance, administrated concentration of the olaparib was gradually increased 40 to 100 mg\/kg (daily, P.O.). The resistant tumors were harvested and re-transplanted into 40 NSG mice. When tumor volumes reached at 100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were divided into 4 groups (Vehicle, Olapairb, Savolitinib, Combination) and olaparib (100 mg\/kg, daily, P.O.) and savolitinib (25 mg\/kg, daily, P.O.) were administrated. We established acquired resistant and innate resistant PDXs, which have BRCA mutation and cMET overexpression. These resistant models were used for evaluation of combined treatment of PARP inhibitor and cMET inhibitor. In case of the olaparib sensitive PDXs, tumor growth was suppressed to a similar level in combination group and olaparib single treatment group. Single treatment of cMET inhibitor also showed little inhibition in tumor growth. In case of the acquired resistant PDXs, tumor growth rate were highly increased in vehicle group than the sensitive PDXs. Contrary to sensitive group, combination treatment was more efficient to inhibit tumor growth rather than olaparib single treatment. The innate resistant PDXs were more tolerated to olapairb than the acquired resistant PDXs. Similar to acquired resistant PDXs, innate PDXs also showed rapid tumor growth in vehicle. As the acquired resistant PDXs, combination treatment was most efficient to inhibited tumor growth. In this study, cMET inhibition sensitized the resistant tumor to PARP inhibitor. These results indicated that savolitinib, novel cMET inhibitor, could have synergy with the PARP inhibitor for patients with PARP inhibitor resistant ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0bd988f-aac5-4ade-b717-d1eeaee3b086\/@z03B8ZRg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Resistance,Ovarian cancer,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19019"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Min-Je Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shin-Wha Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young-Jae Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Su-Bin Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Woo Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong-Man Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is one of the anti-cancer drugs used as first-line treatment for GC. As with other anti-cancer drugs, although acquired resistance to L-OHP is a major problem, no biomarkers are clinically available for L-OHP response. Recently, cancer stem cells (CSCs) were shown to be involved in the acquisition of drug resistance. Hence, the major goal is to discover novel predictive biomarkers and overcome L-OHP resistance in GC in relation to CSCs.<br \/>Methods: We used the organoid model; a culture method that allows 3D in vitro culturing of tissue-like structures and is presumed to contain many stem\/progenitor cells. We established three independent L-OHP-resistant gastric cancer organoids (GCOs) by adding increasing doses of L-OHP in the culture medium over time. Gene expression profiles of the pairs of parental and resistant organoids were evaluated using microarray analysis. We analyzed the microarray data of L-OHP-resistant GCOs with our previous study from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant GCOs (GSE154127). We validated the upregulated genes in the L-OHP-resistant GCOs by qRT-PCR. To confirm the use of upregulated genes as a novel biomarker, we immunohistochemically evaluated the expression levels in GC tissue samples. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of knockdown using both GC cell lines and GCOs.<br \/>Results: Through the comparison of the data, we detected myoferlin (MYOF) to be a candidate gene responsible only for L-OHP resistance. qRT-PCR results confirmed the results of the microarray and found that high expression of MYOF correlated significantly with the IC50 of L-OHP in GCOs. Immunohistochemistry analysis for MYOF using 132 GC cases showed that high expression of MYOF was significantly associated with poor prognosis, T grade, N grade, and lymphatic invasion, and showed MYOF to be an independent prognostic indicator, especially in the GC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The knockdown or inhibition of MYOF by WJ460 in GC cell line and GCOs enhanced L-OHP sensitivity while it reduced cell growth, spheroid\/organoid formation, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenesis.<br \/>Conclusion: We highlight that MYOF is highly involved in L-OHP resistance and tumor progression in GC. Our results indicate that MYOF could be a promising biomarker in GC to predict L-OHP sensitivity and tumor progression and a potential candidate gene as a therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/56b43caa-6383-4c8a-9d14-c32c5b527ab1\/@z03B8ZRg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Cancer stem cell,Oxaliplatin,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19020"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"72ffddbf-2866-4e0e-8d6e-6ac39dca1d3a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72ffddbf-2866-4e0e-8d6e-6ac39dca1d3a\/@z03B8ZRg\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kenji Harada<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naoya Sakamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shoichi Ukai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tsuyoshi Takashima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryota Maruyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daiki Taniyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuaki Tanabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideki Ohdan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wataru Yasui<\/i><\/presenter>.

ALT has been associated with resistance to DNA damaging agents, p53 loss-of-function (p53LOF), <i>ATRX <\/i>mutations, and very poor survival. ATM kinase, which activates functional p53, is constitutively activated in ALT cancers (<i>Science Translational Medicine<\/i> 18:eabd5750, 2021). We hypothesized that the constitutive activation of ATM kinase in ALT cancers would confer high sensitivity to pharmacological reactivation of p53 function.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We used patient-derived ALT (telomeric DNA C-circle positive) and TA+ neuroblastoma, sarcoma, colorectal, and breast cancer cell lines and xenografts treated with the clinical-stage p53 reactivator eprenetapopt (APR-246) and irinotecan. In vitro cytotoxicity was assayed by DIMSCAN digital imaging microscopy, ATM activation by immunofluorescence microscopy, and protein expression by western blotting.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> ALT p53LOF cell lines were significantly (p&#60;0.05) less sensitive to DNA-damaging agents relative to TA+ p53LOF comparators. Constitutive phosphorylation (activation) of ATM kinase and the DNA damage marker 53BP1 were observed at telomeres in ALT but not TA+ cell lines. APR-246 induced p53 targets p21 and NOXA and was significantly more cytotoxic (p&#60;0.001) for ALT relative to TA+ cell lines, regardless of <i>TP53<\/i> status. Overexpression of p53 in a <i>TP53<\/i>-null ALT cell line increased sensitivity (p&#60;0.0001) to APR-246. Knockdown of p53 or ATM kinase in ALT <i>TP53<\/i> mutated and wild-type cell lines antagonized (p&#60;0.0001) APR-246 activity. Induction of telomere dysfunction in a TA+ p53LOF neuroblastoma cell line using dominant-negative TRF2 (a shelterin protein that blocks ATM activation at telomeres) activated ATM and sensitized cells to APR-246 (p&#60;0.01). APR-246 enhanced the cytotoxicity of irinotecan (as SN38) in ALT cell lines <i>in vitro <\/i>to a higher degree than in TA+ p53LOF cell lines (p&#60;0.05). Single-agent APR-246 significantly (p&#60;0.0001) increased event-free survival (EFS) of mice with ALT xenografts relative to controls. APR-246 enhanced (p&#60;0.0001) the activity of irinotecan in 3 neuroblastoma, 2 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1 colorectal, and 1 triple-negative breast ALT xenograft models with most mice (47\/56) achieving complete responses and an EFS of &#62;100 days (45\/56) compared to no complete responses (median EFS ~ 34 days) in mice treated with only irinotecan (p&#60;0.0001). APR-246 + irinotecan had no significant effect relative to irinotecan alone (p=0.08) on EFS of mice with TA+ p53LOF xenografts (median EFS ~ 40 days).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> ALT cancers of a variety of histologies are highly resistant to DNA damaging agents, have p53LOF, and constitutive activation of ATM kinase, which confers high sensitivity to p53 reactivation by APR-246.

We used in vivo experimental systems to determine the effect of combination use of gemcitabine with Vitamin D analogue on pancreatic tumorigenicity. Additionally, we used ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to analyze the relative abundance of intracellular dFdCTP in tumor tissue samples.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified that MUC1 protein expression was significantly reduced in AsPC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells after treatment with vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> or its analogue calcipotriol (Cal) by the RPPA analysis, which was further confirmed in MiaPaca-2 and Colo357 pancreatic cancer cells. VDR negatively regulated MUC1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells in both gain- and loss-of-function assays. We established gemcitabine (Gem) resistant AsPC-1-Gem<sup>R <\/sup>and Colo357-Gem<sup>R<\/sup> cells and found that AsPC-1-Gem<sup>R<\/sup> and Colo357-Gem<sup>R<\/sup> cells had much lower levels of VDR but higher levels of MUC1 protein expression compared to their parental cells, Vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> or its analogue significantly induced VDR and inhibited MUC1 expression in AsPC-1-Gem<sup>R<\/sup> and Colo357-Gem<sup>R<\/sup> cells, and sensitized the resistant cells to gemcitabine treatment. The results of siRNA knockdown experiments indicated that inhibition of MUC1 expression was essential for Cal&#8217;s sensitization of PDA cells to Gem treatment in vitro. In keeping with these findings, administration of the Vitamin D3 analogue, paricalcitol (PA) significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of Gem compared to chemotherapy alone in xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of pancreatic cancer without any significant systemic toxicity. The improved combination treatment correlated with increased intratumoral concentration of dFdCTP, the biological active metabolite of gemcitabine.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This study reveals a previously unidentified vitamin D\/VDR-MUC1 signaling pathway involved in the regulation of gemcitabine resistance of PDA.

LEF1<i> (<\/i>Lymphoid Enhancer Factor 1<i>)<\/i>, a key mediator of Wnt signalling, functions as an interacting partner with &#946;-catenin. Previous studies have shown that LEF1 is associated with leukemic transformation and is an independent prognostic factor in normal karyotype AML. Through high throughput transcriptome profiling between the parental and acquired cytarabine resistant cell lines, we identified that LEF1 to be a potential target mediating this resistance. Here we evaluated the role, of molecular and pharmacological inhibition of LEF1 in overcoming acquired cytarabine resistance. The differential expression of LEF1 in THP1, MV4-11 and U937 parental and Ara-C resistant AML cell lines was checked by quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblot and immunofluorescence. LEF1 knock-out (KO) cells were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 in the THP1 cytarabine resistant cell line. Lentiviral based over-expression of LEF1 was carried out in THP1 parental cell line to ensure that LEF1 promotes Ara-C resistance. For nuclear translocation of LEF1, the small molecule CHIR99021 was used in over-expressed cells.The knock-out and over-expressed cells were characterized by analysing proliferation, cell cycle and cytotoxicity assay. The effect of pharmacological inhibition of LEF1 using niclosamide was examined by in-vitro-cytotoxicity assay.Although LEF1 transcript expression was high in all the three cytarabine resistant cell lines compared to the parental cell lines, THP1-araC-R cell line showed around &#8776; 500-fold change in expression and hence was used for further experiments. THP1-araC-R was marginally cross resistant to both DNR (IC50 Parent -0.19&#181;M, AraC 0.26&#181;M) and ATO (IC50 Parent -2.1&#181;M, AraC &#62;4&#181;M). LEF1 knock-out showed complete absence of LEF1 protein, decreased rate of proliferation and improved sensitivity to Ara-C (Ara-C IC50- 1430 &#181;M in the untransduced vs. 387.4 &#181;M after LEF1 KO). Over-expression of LEF1 with a fold change of &#8776;1000 followed by enforced nuclear translocation using the small molecule CHIR99021 in parental cell line resulted in increased resistance to Ara-C (IC50 Parental- 50.7&#181;M vs OE CHIR treated 240.05&#181;M). Further, niclosamide, the pharmacological inhibitor of LEF1 was able to re-sensitize the THP1 AraC -resistant cells (IC50: 1430 &#181;M for UT vs 516.8 &#181;M treated with niclosamide). <b><\/b> Our results suggest that inhibition of LEF1 by molecular and pharmacological means showed considerable increase in cytarabine sensitivity in-vitro while we are testing its effect in-vivo using a transplantable AML mouse model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2d7debf9-9b73-4e50-8d85-3a97b7579f26\/@A03B8ZRh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,LEF1,cytarabine resistance,WNT pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21571"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Saswati Das<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raveen Stephen Stallon Illangeswaran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Zechariah Paul Jebanesan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakhi Thalayatta Vidhyadharan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nayanthara Karpillymoola Bijukumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bharathi Murugan Rajamani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Michaelis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jindrich Cinatl jr.<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vikram Mathews<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaji Ramchandran Velayudhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Poonkuzhali Balasubramanian<\/i><\/presenter>.

Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting MET have been developed, but durable response is invariably limited by the emergence of acquired resistance. In this study, we examined the preclinical activity of a MET x MET biparatopic antibody to a novel maytansinoid payload, REGN5093-M114, in MET-driven patient-derived models.<br \/>Experimental Design: We had previously established patient-derived models from EGFR-TKIs resistant patients with MET-amplified or -overexpressed EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs), patient-derived cells (PDCs), or ATCC cell lines were used for cell viability, apoptosis assay and western blots to investigate the activity of REGN5093-M114. In order to explore the predictive biomarker correlates of REGN5093-M114 and MET status, we investigated whole MET expression, surface MET expression by flow cytometry, MET amplification by copy number analysis. We evaluated the antitumor activity of REGN5093-M114 in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models from EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to osimertinib plus savolitinib, including acquired MET p.Y1230C mutation. Finally, we determined whether REGN5093-M114 is able to overcome acquired resistance to the MET-TKI, tepotinib, using PDC from METex14 mutant NSCLC patients.<br \/>Result: In acquired MET-amplified EGFR-TKI resistant PDCs, PDOs, ATCC cell lines and PDX models, REGN5093-M114 alone exhibited a significant antitumor efficacy compared to MET-TKI or the MET x MET biparatopic antibody (REGN5093), but had no effect on some models with same MET copy number as the sensitive models. On the other hand, regardless of MET CNV, MET-overexpressed TKI-na&#239;ve EGFR mutant NSCLC cells showed a sensitive response to REGN5093-M114. Thus, we calculated the area under the curve plot for REGN5093-M114 by quantifying whole MET expression, surface MET expression, and MET CNV values for each cell line. As a result, the surface MET expression had the most predictive power on determining the efficacy of the REGN5093-M114. Notably, REGN5093-M114 potently reduced tumor growth of EGFR mutant NSCLC with PTEN loss or MET Y1230C mutation after progression on prior TATTON study. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the combined treatment of MET-TKI and REGN5093-M114 shows synergistic antitumor efficacy with a marked reduction of MET downstream signals and increased apoptotic proteins in the METex14 mutant NSCLC. Altogether, REGN5093-M114 is a potent candidate to overcome the current challenges faced in targeting MET pathway.<br \/>Conclusion: REGN5093-M114 has the potential to be a novel therapeutic option in NSCLC harboring MET genetic alterations, and further clinical application is highly warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/21b507fb-393b-4284-942d-7d9d10b601f9\/@A03B8ZRh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Resistance,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),MET exon 14 skipping mutation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20028"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Seung Yeon Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sun Min Lim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>You Won Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun Ji Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Hwan Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seong Gu Heo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mi Ra Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hee Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hye Ryun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John DaSilva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Daly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mi Ran Yun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byoung Chul Cho<\/i><\/presenter>. &#61548;\u0009Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Rep. of Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Rep. of Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc, New York, NY, Division of Medical Oncology, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5e2e7ddf-e433-4a96-a323-9235863be3b5","ControlNumber":"8008","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

FF-10101 is the first irreversible, covalent inhibitor of FLT3 and has shown activity against <i>FLT3<\/i> F691L and D835 mutations. We evaluated FF-10101 against an expanded panel of <i>FLT3<\/i> resistance mutations and activating mechanisms of MAPK signaling associated with FLT3 TKI resistance in AML cell lines and patient samples.<br \/>Results: FF-10101 was uniformly active against a series of previously unevaluated FLT3 TKI resistant D835 mutations (sensitivity = IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60;10X of FLT3-ITD alone in Ba\/F3 cells). FF-10101 was more active against F691L than gilteritinib (8-fold vs 14-fold increase in IC<sub>50<\/sub> vs. FLT3-ITD, respectively). K429E and N676K mutations associated with clinical resistance to crenolanib and midostaurin, respectively, were also both FF-10101-sensitive. G697S and Y693N mutations, previously identified by random saturation mutagenesis screening to confer resistance to gilteritinib, also conferred moderate resistance to FF-10101 while Y693C conferred a high degree of resistance to both (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62;50X higher than <i>FLT3<\/i>-ITD). D698N, however, was FF-10101-sensitive and gilteritinib-resistant. Using a cell-based model, we confirmed C695 as the lone residue covalently bound by FF-10101. Moreover, a mutagenesis screen for FF-10101 resistance identified only C695Y\/R mutations. Structural modeling showed an aromatic &#960;-&#960; interaction between FF-10101 and Y693 that orients an electrophilic acrylamide portion for covalent bonding of FLT3 at C695, likely explaining resistance conferred by Y693C. Confirmatory mutagenesis experiments showed that Y693F, by recapitulating the native aromatic interaction, retained FF-10101 sensitivity while the non-aromatic Y693S mutation conferred a high degree of resistance. Finally, FF-10101 exerted generally greater cytotoxicity than gilteritinib in <i>FLT3<\/i>-ITD+ AML cell lines (MOLM-14 and MV4-11) and three <i>FLT3<\/i>-mutant AML patient samples cultured in HS5 stromal cell conditioned media that models bone marrow microenvironment (BME) induced TKI resistance. In MOLM-14s, FF-10101 more effectively suppressed rebound ERK re-activation after 24h drug exposure than gilteritinib, potentially explaining this enhanced activity. Nevertheless, MOLM-14 and MV4-11s with <i>NRAS<\/i> G12C and Q61K co-mutations exhibited significant resistance to FF-10101 and gilteritinib.<br \/>Conclusions: FF-10101 is active against nearly all mutations associated with FLT3 TKI resistance except for C695 mutations (site of FF-10101 binding) and the gilteritinib\/crenolanib-resistant Y693C mutation (which has yet to be identified clinically). FF-10101 potentially overcomes resistance associated with the BME but likely remains vulnerable to RAS activating mutants. In report of phase 1 study of FF-10101 in relapsed\/refractory AML (NCT03194685), 8\/30 evaluable patients exhibited response (27%) with five responding patients previously receiving a FLT3 TKI, including one CRi after progression on gilteritinib. These results and our findings show that FF-10101 has potential to benefit AML patients that acquire certain FLT3 TKD resistance mutations or exhibit progression with other FLT3 TKIs, including gilteritinib.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/507e0278-5cad-466f-96c9-2c0dc1daf796\/@A03B8ZRh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Kinase inhibitors,FLT3,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20395"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy T.

Given the increasing clinical use of Tuc, resistance will likely soon emerge as a challenge. Here, we explore the yet unknown mechanisms of resistance to Tuc and identify treatment strategies to overcome it. Our recently developed models of BT474 (AZ and ATCC) with acquired resistance to Tuc (TucR) and their sensitive parental (P) were used. DNA-seq, RNA-seq, and RPPA\/western blot were performed. Knockdown studies were performed using EGFR siRNA. Drug efficacy studies involved cell growth assays by imaging-based or methylene blue assays. We recently reported (SABCS 2021) that our BT474 TucR models acquired <i>EGFR<\/i> amplification. The TucR cells displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated (p) and total (t) EGFR, pHER2, pHER3, and downstream pAKT and pS6, which were substantially suppressed by the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib (Gef) or even further when combined with Tuc. Our new results demonstrate that EGFR knockdown selectively inhibits the growth and pHER2 levels in TucR vs P cells, supporting our hypothesis that heterodimerization of amplified EGFR with HER2 leads to higher pHER2 levels in TucR cells. We have recently also shown that TucR models were hypersensitive to Gef and this inhibition was further enhanced with Gef+Tuc, implying their survival dependence on EGFR. Here, we demonstrate that the TucR cells made resistant to 200nM Tuc maintain their resistant growth and elevated EGFR-dependent signaling even when exposed to 500nM, and can begrown as xenografts in the presence of clinically relevant dose of Tuc, emphasizing their true resistance via amplified EGFR. Importantly, both TucR models vs P cells were cross-resistant to trastuzumab but maintain partial sensitivity to TDM1. While the EGFR-specific antibody cetuximab (Cet) was partially effective as a single agent only in the ATCC model, it potently inhibited growth and induced cell killing in combination with Tuc in both models. A significantly greater inhibition in cell growth and survival was also observed when trastuzumab or TDM1 was combined with either Gef or Cet. Taken together, our results suggest that the activation of HER2 and the resistant growth and survival in the TucR models is completely dependent on the amplified EGFR, which we are currently further corroborating by additional mechanistic and xenograft studies. Whilst we have previously reported that resistance to lapatinib and neratinib confer cross-resistance to Tuc, our recent findings show that resistance to Tuc may be overcome using dual\/pan-HER TKIs or the combination of potent EGFR and HER2 inhibitors. Overall, our novel findings hold crucial implications in light of the current treatment landscape of HER2+ BC and biomarkers of resistance, and places a particular emphasis on considerations to sequence currently available TKIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9f76f6a5-7662-424a-b348-c6c97ffa15d8\/@A03B8ZRh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2\/neu,Breast cancer,EGFR,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20402"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jamunarani Veeraraghavan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fu-Tien Liao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tia Gordon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pier Selenica<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarmistha Nanda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lanfang Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingjie Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juber A.
