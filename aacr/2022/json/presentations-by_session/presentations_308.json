[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable plasma cell malignancy, has a relative 5-year overall survival (OS) of 48.5% for newly diagnosed patients. Prospective real-world data reveals that 23% of transplant eligible MM patients relapse within 12 months of starting first-line bortezomib based therapy with a median OS of only 16.8 months (high-risk - HR). Genomic studies for these HR patients could inform rational secondary therapeutic options and prolong survival. Bone marrow (BM) genomic analysis in MM has methodological and conceptual shortcomings owing to the spatially and genomically heterogeneous nature of MM that can be largely overcome with circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis.<br \/><b>Objective: <\/b>To determine whether ctDNA analysis can define the mutational spectrum of patients with HR MM.<br \/><b>Design: <\/b>Phase II, multicentre single arm study of carfilzomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (KTd) in 50 transplant-eligible newly diagnosed MM patients from September 2016 to April 2018 (Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) - MM17 trial) who were refractory (REF) to or demonstrated a suboptimal response (SOR) to bortezomib-based induction therapy. A total of 186 peripheral blood plasma and BM samples were obtained at baseline, at Cycle 3 day 1 (C3D1), end of the study (EOS) and\/or at relapse. Somatic variants were identified with an ultra-sensitive targeted amplicon sequencing (TAS) assay incorporating 22-genes known to be mutated in MM. The mutational spectrum was correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and OS.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>TAS of 31 BM samples and 48 ctDNA samples revealed that in BM, <i>KRAS <\/i>mutations were detected in 42% of patients followed by <i>ATR<\/i> in 29% while in ctDNA, <i>ATR<\/i> mutations were prominent (36%), followed by <i>FGFR3<\/i> and <i>ATM<\/i> (27% and 26.8%). We compared the ctDNA mutational spectrum at baseline between non-relapse and relapse patients on KTd and identified a significant difference in the proportion of patients with specific mutations - <i>RAS\/RAF<\/i>: 3% vs 25%; <i>ATM\/ATR\/TP53<\/i>: 17% vs 41%, respectively (p&#60;0.0001). Patients with <i>RAS\/RAF<\/i> and\/or <i>ATM\/ATR\/TP53<\/i> ctDNA mutations at baseline had significantly shorter PFS and OS (p=0.003 and p=0.02, respectively). Comparative ctDNA TAS for baseline, C3D1, EOS\/relapse, demonstrated that in 87.5% of patients, one or more dominant mutations driving relapse in KTd were already present prior to starting salvage therapy. We also performed ctDNA analysis to compare patients who were REF or SOR to front-line therapy and identified 62% of REF patients had <i>RAS\/RAF <\/i>or <i>ATM\/ATR\/TP53 <\/i>mutation compared to 35% of SOR patients (p=0.0002, Fisher&#8217;s exact test).<br \/><b><\/b><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our results demonstrate that <i>RAS\/RAF <\/i>and <i>ATM\/ATR\/TP53 <\/i>mutations in ctDNA are prognostic biomarkers of outcome to secondary salvage therapy in HR patients thus enabling design of targeted therapeutic approaches to improve survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7a07a2d9-2920-4c11-8702-87f6190f3ad7\/@v03B8ZB5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,High-risk,Circulating tumor DNA,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12568"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sridurga Mithraprabhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Reynolds<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Kalff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krystal Bergin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rose Turner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hang Quach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noemia Horvath<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Kerridge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Flora Yuen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kawa Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malarmathy Ramachandran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley George<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiffany Khong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Durie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Andrew Spencer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, especially in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), numbers of CTCs detected and isolatable from peripheral blood samples using standard EPCAM-based techniques are too low to perform robust multi-omics analyses. Recent data suggested that diagnostic leukapheresis (DLA) can be used to increase CTC numbers by enriching them from larger blood volumes. Here, we present single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNAseq) from 3172 NSCLC CTCs isolated by DLA.<br \/>Between 3.1 and 8.0 liters of blood volume was processed with DLA and mononuclated cells were collected from six stage IV NSCLC patients. A total of 80x10<sup>8<\/sup> cells (&#8776;33% of the DLA) were used for magnetic depletion of CD31<sup>+<\/sup>, CD3<sup>+<\/sup>, CD16<sup>+<\/sup>, CD235a<sup>+<\/sup> and CD45<sup>+ <\/sup>cells followed by FACS sorting for CD45 negativity. Sorted cells were subjected to scRNAseq analysis using 10X Genomics. CTC transcriptomes were identified by marker gene expression (Satija Lab, US and R package SingleR). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on hallmark gene sets were performed to compare CTC transcriptomes and sc transcriptomes from primary NSCLC tumors.<br \/>Unsupervised dimensional reduction and clustering revealed 7 distinct CTC cluster. Inferred copy number variation (CNV) analyses confirmed greater CNV variability compared to hematopoietic cells and a high degree of heterogeneity consistent with tumor cells. Also, CTC transcriptomes showed significantly higher expression of cancer-associated genes like Cyclin D1 and metastasis-associated protein 2 compared to normal hematopoietic cells. CTC clustering was independent of patient or histology, thus indicating a potential function-based clustering. Pseudotime analyses of all scCTC transcriptomes revealed three principal CTC phenotypes: (i) epithelial-like (expression of E-Cadherin), highly proliferative (expression of KI67 and E2F targets pathway) and immune responsive (enriched for IL1B, Interferon-&#945;\/&#947;-response pathways), (ii) mesenchymal\/invasive (expression of Vimentin, mTORC1, hypoxia and glycolysis pathways) and (iii) mesenchymal\/cancer stem cell-like (enrichment of genes including ALDH1A3 and oxidative phosphorylation and adipogenesis pathways). Compared to a set of scRNAseq data from primary NSCLC tumors (n=46), GSEA revealed an enrichment of pathways involved in cell cycle, anti-apoptosis and invasion in CTCs suggesting higher malignant potential compared to tissue-resident NSCLC tumor cells.<br \/>Performing CTC enrichment using DLAs resulted in generation of an unprecedented number of transcriptomes from individual CTCs derived from NSCLC patients. Our data should lead to a better understanding of the heterogeneity of blood circulating CTCs and their associated biology and may allow rational design of CTC-targeting drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0c04379-f79e-4506-8e43-4017f9e4a0d1\/@v03B8ZB5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12569"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lisa-Marie Rieckmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Spohn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ekaterina Selbuz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Schubert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Agorku<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Becker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alina Borchers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenny Krause<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Ruff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarina Heinemann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Franca Kobus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jurek Hille<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andia Louisa Tehrany<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janna-Lisa Velthaus-Rusik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sören Franzenburg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petros Christopoulos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hauke Winter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Riethdorf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicola Gagliani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carsten Bokemeyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian F.

These molecular subtypes may confer differential biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities, however, studies to date have been constrained by the paucity of available longitudinal tumor biopsy samples obtained from patients with SCLC. Herein, we utilized circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to characterize subtype marker heterogeneity at the time of diagnosis and evaluate the dynamic nature of marker expression during treatment in patients with SCLC.<br \/>Methods: Informed consent was obtained from patients with SCLC using an IRB approved protocol (IRB#030763). We have collected blood samples from 32 patients, including treatment na&#239;ve samples from the entire cohort as well as on-treatment samples (median of 4 collections per patient). We utilized the RareCyte rare-cell analysis platform to isolate and quantify CTCs, which were defined as CK\/EpCAM positive and CD45 negative. Each sample was also evaluated for expression of neuroendocrine markers (ASCL1, NEUROD1) and non-neuroendocrine markers (YAP1, POU2F3). Each set of neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine markers were co-stained along with the CTC markers. Mean fluorescence intensity of each marker was extracted using a python program.<br \/>Results: To date, we have analyzed 22\/32 (69%) treatment na&#239;ve samples, including n=6 patients with early stage disease and n=16 patients with advanced\/metastatic disease. We detected CTCs from 16\/22 (73%) patients, with quantities ranging from 1 - 3406 (median = 66) per 7.5ml of blood. CTCs were positive for the neuroendocrine markers ASCL1 in 16\/16 (100%) and NEUROD1 in 10\/16 (62%); all NEUROD1 positive CTCs were also positive for ASCL1. The non-neuroendocrine markers YAP1 and POU2F3 were detected in 6\/16 (37%) and 11\/16 (69%) samples, respectively, including YAP1\/POU2F3 double positives in 6\/16 (37%). Analysis of on-treatment samples is ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: We have developed a protocol for monitoring expression of subtype markers on CTCs isolated from patients with SCLC. We found CTCs expressing both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine markers at the time of diagnosis. Ongoing work will attempt to delineate the dynamic nature of subtype marker expression during therapy, to correlate with clinical outcomes. These studies have the potential to offer critical insights regarding the heterogeneity and evolution of SCLC, a tumor type in which novel disease insights and innovative treatment strategies are urgently needed to improve patient survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9988eec0-3477-4947-bdc0-b0f234ab6ea3\/@v03B8ZB5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Lung cancer: small cell,Neuroendocrine tumors,ASCL1, NEUROD1, YAP1, POU2F3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12571"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"0a1dc544-1894-4a12-94c4-a03e96d99c92","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a1dc544-1894-4a12-94c4-a03e96d99c92\/@v03B8ZB5\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Prasad R.

Methylation is an important epigenetic modification that influences cellular differentiation and gene expression. Recently, liquid biopsies have started to incorporate analyses of epigenetic modifications for screening purposes to detect cancer-derived DNA in the blood. Additionally, epigenetic modifications are being used to also assign a tissue of origin to the cancer to direct confirmatory diagnostic procedures. Obtaining sufficient amounts of ccfDNA for assay development, validation, and proficiency testing is difficult. Furthermore, methods of analyzing the epigenetic modifications, such as bisulfite conversion, can damage a significant fraction of the input material; but, failing to carry them out to completion can result in an over-estimation of methylation. To address the challenges associated with assessing the methylation of ccfDNA, we created and characterized three types of RMs. The first type of RM is a fragmented genome of the GM24385 reference cell line that is used to create a set of RMs with different degrees of methylation (0 %, ~25 %, ~50 %, ~75 % and close to 100 %). The exact degree of methylation was assigned by digital PCR using assays for heterozygous SNPs, where one allele is both a site for CpG methylation and a recognition site for a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme while the other allele is not. The second type of RM is an amplified ccfDNA sample that has been methylated similarly but also reproduces the fragment lengths and genomic representation biases of ccfDNA. The degree of methylation was assigned by digital PCR, but only a subset of assays was useful because not all SNPs were heterozygous. The third type of RM is an amplified ccfDNA sample that has been processed to mimic the methylation found in the original ccfDNA. Analyses of the RMs by whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that, while bisulfite conversion and\/or the amplification of the resulting dU-containing DNA appeared to lead to significant biases in genomic representation, the resulting data was generally in agreement with the amount of methylation assigned by digital PCR. Additionally, it was possible to prepare an RM that generally reproduces the methylation found in ccfDNA; although, this was limited to individual molecules having either no or close to full methylation, which is unlikely to be the case for all molecules of ccfDNA in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/74787099-5e7a-416e-87fe-dee44228d8c7\/@v03B8ZB5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,Screening,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12743"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jayanthi Ramprakash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Matthew G.

The immunosuppressive and inflammatory background of lung cancer (LC), led us to hypothesize that the tumour and the circulating immune cell profiles could be source of biomarkers for LC risk assessment. In this respect we already developed a plasma microRNA-signature classifier (MSC) that stratifies LC screening patients in high, intermediate and low risk groups. To get insight we investigated tumour tissues and peripheral blood immune cell profiles of these patients. The possibility to develop molecular tests reflecting an immunosuppressive status for prognostic and diagnostic purposes was also explored.<br \/>The immune cell composition of 40 frozen LC tissues collected during screening trials from patients with a different MSC risk profile were assessed by deconvolution analysis using CIBERSORT software. Results were validated by RT-qPCR and IHC, as well as using RNAseq data from the 1000 lung cancer patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. From a training set composed by 20 LC patients and 20 matched controls, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by flow cytometry using a 24 marker panel to encompass monocyte and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) subsets, regulatory T cells, cytolytic NK cells and activated\/exhausted\/hyperexausted T cells. Gene signatures of relevant immune cell subsets were then validated and employed to define a RT-qPCR based algorithm using plasma samples collected from an independent set of 40 LC patients and 40 matched controls.<br \/>At the tumor tissue level, CIBERSORT analysis indicated a significant reduction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and a concomitant increase of regulatory T cells in MSC high risk patients, characterized by worse prognosis compared to intermediate\/low risk patients. A 168 gene signature able to discriminate these two groups was identified. Furthermore, within the LC TCGA datasets the identified signature stratified two groups of patients with different 5-years overall survival (p&#60;0.01). Flow cytometry analysis of PBMC samples confirmed the lower number of lymphocytes at systemic level measured in tumor specimens of MSC high risk patients. This was paralleled by an increase of exhausted T cells as well as classical, inflammatory and monocytic MDSCs. By comparing LC cases and controls an algorithm composed by four immune cell subsets resulted in 0.91 and 0.72 AUC values in the training and validation set, respectively. Based on these results a 14 immune related gene signature was finally developed and tested on samples of the validation set, where an AUC of 0.75 was observed.<br \/>Overall, these findings suggest that immunosuppressive features at tumour and systemic discriminate LC patients with worse outcome. Molecular-based tests able to recapitulate these features could be easily moved into the clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ebe35b6-90b7-4efe-8c6c-ef8b7d22057b\/@v03B8ZB5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Lung cancer,Microenvironment,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12744"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mattia Boeri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Huber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Orazio Fortunato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ugo Pastorino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Licia Rivoltini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriella Sozzi<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, early stage HCC is difficult to detect without invasive surgical procedures. Additionally, current blood-based biomarkers have low sensitivity and specificity in detecting HCC. Human data and animal models support a functional role for the TGF-&#946; pathway in HCC initiation and progression. The goal of this study is to determine whether TGF-&#946; pathway markers can predict HCC in cirrhotic patients that are at high risk for HCC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We used an aptamer-based high-throughput proteomics assay to detect a selected set of proteins associated with fibrosis or TGF-&#946; signaling in serum samples from 101 patients with only cirrhosis and 33 patients with cirrhosis and HCC.<b> <\/b>We applied multivariable logistic regression modeling to identify a biomarker panel predictive of HCC and then integrated this model with clinical variables to develop and a final predictive HCC model. The predictive power, sensitivity, and specificity of the final model were determined.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified a protein signature in patient serum that differentiated patients with only cirrhosis from those with HCC. We also identified a potential high-risk cirrhosis patient group (n = 14) with a similar signature to that of HCC patients. The logistic regression model identified that a panel of 15 proteins was independently predictive of HCC. By adding clinical predictors into the model, we developed a model that required only 5 of the proteins to achieve high predictive power. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the final model showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96. The mean predicted probability of having HCC was 8.3% in the non-HCC group [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.6 - 11.1%] and 75% in the HCC group (95% CI 63 - 86%). At a threshold of 0.30, sensitivity was 0.88, specificity was 0.88, and positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.71. At a threshold of 0.04, the sensitivity increased to 1.0 at the expense of specificity (0.64) and PPV (0.48).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The final 5-protein model that includes clinical variables represents a potential non-invasive method to detect early HCC. Furthermore, follow up studies of patients with the 15-protein signature that resembles the signature of HCC patients is warranted to determine if this signature represents patients in the earliest stages of HCC or who subsequently are diagnosed with HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd691874-7ea0-4184-82d6-bd7a24f4ad2c\/@w03B8ZB6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Serum marker,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12745"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shuyun Rao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Amdur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiyan Xiyan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirti Shetty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Herbert Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linda L.

A serum-based biomarker used along with mammography to identify lesions that need to be biopsied may improve the sensitivity of mammography and reduce the number of biopsies needed. We have identified a panel of autoantibodies found in early breast cancer. An autoantibody biomarker is ideal because antibody immunity can be detected with very low levels of antigen with direct antigen recognition by B cells resulting in clonal amplification of antigen specific plasma cells. Work in our laboratory has identified tumor-associated proteins present in pre-malignant tumors that are necessary for survival of human breast cancer cells across breast cancer subtypes. Increased autoantibodies to seven of these early tumor-associated proteins (PDIA6, KRT8, SERBP1, ARPC2, RRM2, AURKA, and NDC80) were present in the sera of women with DCIS and invasive breast cancer in two independent serum collections but not in control women with no known breast lesions.<br \/>The presence of autoantibodies in the discovery set was evaluated in 185 individuals: 42 control women, 12 women with hyperplasia, 36 patients with fibroadenoma, 59 patients with ductal carcinoma <i>in situ<\/i> (DCIS), and 36 patients with invasive breast cancer (IBC). The validation set was evaluated in 228 individuals: 50 control patients, 50 patients with fibroadenoma, 18 patients with hyperplasia, 50 patients with DCIS, and 60 patients with IBC, 20 with hormone receptor positive (HR+) HER2 negative, 20 with HER2+, and 20 triple negative (TN). We defined a positive autoantibody response as over 2 standard deviations above the mean found in control women. All seven autoantibodies could predict patients with hyperplasia, fibroadenoma, DCIS, and IBC in both the discovery and validation sets. For example, the seven-antibody panel could identify DCIS from control women with AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.912 to 0.995, p&#60;0.0001) and validation set AUC 0.63 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.74, p=0.026). The seven-antibody panel could identify IBC from control women with AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.97, p&#60;0.0001) and validation 0.70 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.79, p&#60;0.0001). Furthermore, the seven-antibody panel could identify women with each of the breast cancer subtypes as compared to control women. Women with HR+HER2- breast cancer could be detected with AUC 0.69 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.83 p=0.014), women with HER2+ breast cancer could be detected with AUC 0.69 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.90, p=0.02), and women with triple negative breast cancer could be detected with AUC 0.69 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.83, p=0.002) in the validation set. Future studies will evaluate this panel in a prospective study at the time of mammography to identify a serum biomarker that will improve sensitivity of mammography.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58b76d69-993a-4f3b-8400-34825cd1d2a3\/@w03B8ZB6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Screening,DCIS,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12746"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sasha Elizabeth Stanton<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Schlumbohm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik Ramos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Drescher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Marks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary L.

Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are fluid-filled protrusions either on or inside the pancreas and can either be benign or pre-malignant. Current clinical guidelines to risk stratify PCL patients are imperfect. Multi-omic profiling of pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF) could aid in the identification of a novel biomarker panel to improve PCL risk stratification.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Methods:<\/b> PCF was collected from 40 patients by EUS-FNA, with matched serum collected prior to EUS. Patients were stratified using the 2018 European evidence-based guidelines into low-risk (n=15), high risk (n=15) and no-risk or pseudocyst (n=10). PCF was sonicated and subsequently processed using an SP3 paramagnetic bead protocol prior to LC-MS. MS-generated LFQ intensity data were analyzed in Perseus (v1.6.13.0) and STRING (v11.5). HTG microRNA whole transcriptome sequencing was run on whole PCF. MiRNA sequencing data were analyzed using HTG EdgeSeq Reveal (v3.1.0). Spearman correlations were generated using R packages &#8216;Hmisc&#8217; (v4.5-0) and &#8216;corrplot&#8217; (v0.90).<b><\/b><br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> MS-analysis of PCF revealed 8 proteins to be significantly upregulated in high-risk compared to low-risk (p&#60;0.05, FDR=0.05, s0=0.1). All 8 proteins had significantly positive correlations with patient risk and expression of the other seven. LCN-2, REG1A, LGALS3, PIGR and S100A8 have been shown to be elevated in the blood of pancreatic cancer patients. PRSS8 is known to be elevated in the serum of ovarian cancer patients, while MUC6 and TCN1 have not been shown to be differentially expressed in the circulation of cancer patients. STRING analysis revealed 11.8% and 6.8% of the proteins identified to be involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses, respectively. Significant positive correlations were found between 11 immune-associated proteins and patient risk classification (p&#60;0.05). Whole transcriptome sequencing revealed 3 miRNA (miR-216a-5p, miR-216b-5p and HK_SKORA66) to be significantly upregulated in high-risk PCF compared to low-risk, and 5 miRNA (miR-197-5p, miR-6741-5p, miR-3180-3p, miR-3180 and miR-6782-5p) to be significantly upregulated in matched high-risk serum compared to low-risk (adj-p&#60;0.05, FDR=0.05, s0=0.1). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of patients using the 8 differentially expressed proteins and 3 miRNA from the PCF gave a clustering accuracy of 95.8%, with just 1\/24 patients being misclassified.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Conclusion:<\/b> We have identified a putative multi-omic biomarker panel for PCL patient risk stratification.

Although liquid biopsy provides a new option for early cancer detection, the limitations of detecting a few molecules of blood-based biomarkers naturally shed by the cancer remain. Earli is developing a highly sensitive, orthogonal approach that uses a genetic construct that usurps dysregulated pathways and actively forces cancer cells to drive the expression of a detectable &#8216;synthetic&#8217; biomarker. We previously used murine xenograft models to validate the tumor detection properties of EARLI-001, a circular DNA containing a human derived cancer-activated promoter to drive the transient expression of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), a protein normally expressed only during fetal development. Biodistribution following intravenous (IV) administration of EARLI-001 shows a broad tissue tropism, enabling the potential to monitor multiple tissues for malignant cells. A single dose of EARLI-001 administered in a pulmonary metastatic cancer mouse model resulted in a 95-fold increase in serum SEAP compared to healthy controls.<br \/>Recognizing the inherent limitations of murine models, we evaluated EARLI-001 in canines diagnosed with cancer. Dog cancers share many features with human malignancies including spontaneous tumor formation, heterogeneity, growth kinetics, histology, and comparable dysregulated genetic pathways. Furthermore, the use of dogs allows the study of EARLI-001 in an immune competent setting and with substantially increased size (up to 65 kg) comparable to scaling into human subjects.<br \/>EARLI-001 was first tested for safety and biodistribution in 54 purpose-bred beagles in MTD and GLP toxicology studies which reveal that<b> <\/b>it is safe and well tolerated across a broad range of clinical doses. Biodistribution analysis in 12 tissues showed nanoplasmid levels peaking in the first days post dose and rapidly decreased to background levels by 60 days. These non-tumor bearing dogs showed no serum SEAP signal at all doses. Following IACUC approval and informed owner consent, EARLI-001 was administered to companion dogs in a standard 3 x 3 dose escalation study, with an expanded mid-range cohort. These companion dogs harbored a wide variety of spontaneous tumors in different tissues of origin. In tumor bearing dogs, EARLI-001 elicited a clear and discernable cancer-activated SEAP signal in 1 of 3 dogs dosed at 0.01 mg\/kg, 3 of 6 dosed at 0.03 mg\/kg, 2 of 2 at 0.07 mg\/kg and 8 of 8 dogs dosed at 0.1 mg\/kg. Furthermore, the MTD was not reached, and no significant dose-limiting toxicity was observed in these older, disease-burdened animals.<b> <\/b>These results show the utility of the platform to interrogate tumor biology and detect the presence of malignancies in relevant <i>in vivo <\/i>models<i> <\/i>and provided the critical safety and efficacy data towards a first-in-human clinical study in lung cancer initiated in 2021.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dfab761a-051e-4a02-9b87-7ed9796527cd\/@w03B8ZB6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Cancer activated expression,Synthetic biomarker,Dog,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12748"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Regina Nieu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Phenix<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Hauss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hadley Hanson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nga Ho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Harwig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shireen Rudina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Badri Ananthanarayanan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bijee George<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Maggie C.

The disease is largely indolent in nature and treatment of low-risk prostate cancer is not always necessary. However, a fraction of the patients will progress to aggressive disease which accounts for most of the cancer related mortality. Detection methods accurately differentiating between high- and low-risk patients for lethal prostate cancer is a critical need and currently, prostate biopsies and subsequent histopathology and molecular profiling are the most definitive way to differentiate between these two patient populations. But biopsies are invasive procedures associated with significant morbidity. Hence, there exists a critical need to develop non-invasive and highly sensitive diagnostic biomarkers to avoid unnecessary biopsies. Here, we propose to develop a novel biomarker panel which constitutes of a class of RNA molecules called circular RNA (circRNA) to be detected in liquid biopsies. Circular RNAs are covalently closed RNA structures, which are resistant to degradation by exoribonucleases because of the absence of free termini in their nucleotide chain. Due to their increased stability compared to their linear counterparts, circRNAs are ideal candidates for biomarkers, especially in non-invasive liquid biopsies. Using MiOncoCirc, a circRNA compendium from &#62;2,000 primary and metastatic cancer tissues representing 40 cancer types, we first identified 9 circRNAs that are specifically expressed in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) compared to all other cancer types. Next, we examined if these candidates are differentially expressed between PRAD and normal prostate tissues. Based on higher levels of expression which were statistically significant in the PRAD compared to normal prostate tissues, we promoted 4 circRNAs to our biomarker panel. In addition, our panel also includes 2 circRNAs that we predicted to arise from PRAD specific lncRNAs. To study the expression of the novel 6-circRNA biomarker expression in high-risk prostate cancer patients we developed a capture-based RNA sequencing assay. For the initial round we used this assay to test our pilot post-DRE patient urine sample EDRN cohort and detected expression of the prostate cancer-specific circRNAs in a subset of these post-DRE urine samples. We are in the process of expanding our test cohort which will also contain additional clinical annotations such as Gleason score. Post cohort assembly we intend to run our 6-circRNA capture assay on these samples to determine whether the expression levels of candidate circRNAs are correlated with disease stage and other clinical parameters. Our results will facilitate the rapid development of a diagnostic test using non-invasive urine samples for the early detection of high-risk prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6b775b82-e3d7-46dc-bba4-710cb71bdefe\/@w03B8ZB6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Prostate cancer,Liquid biopsies,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12750"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Palak Shah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pushpinder Bawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lanbo Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yelena Kleyman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josh Vo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saravana M.

However, effective screening tools for early cancer detection is currently limited to a subset of cancer types. Profiling cell-free DNA (cfDNA) patterns has emerged as a prominent non-invasive biomarker for detection and subtyping of cancers. However, owing to difficulties in observing the early development of human malignancies as cancers are often detected once they become symptomatic, most cancer biomarker and evolution studies to date have primarily examined the genomics from solid tumour or liquid biopsies following a diagnosis. Utilizing cfDNA as a screening tool for early cancer detection requires profiling of blood plasma samples collected from asymptomatic individuals prior to the diagnosis of cancers to enable assessment of the earliest detectability and predictive performance of potential biomarkers. Here, we leverage the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow&#8217;s Health Project (CanPaTH), to profile blood plasma collected prior to the clinical detection of underlying cancers. Specifically, we use cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq), a highly sensitive assay for profiling cfDNA methylomes, to profile over 300 blood plasma samples collected up to seven years prior to the detection of a breast, prostate or pancreatic cancer, in addition to matched controls with no history of cancer free through follow-up. We identified differentially methylated signatures in pre-diagnosis cfDNA that discriminated cancer-free controls from pre-diagnosis cancer cases up to seven years before diagnosis, and demonstrated that these markers were reflective of differentially methylated in cancer tissue relative to normal tissue and peripheral blood leukocytes. Further, predictive modelling reveals that cfDNA methylation markers in blood are predictive of pre-diagnosis breast cancer cases, achieving an average test AUROC of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70 - 0.80). Predictive models trained solely with pre-diagnosis cfDNA methylation samples were also predictive of prostate and pancreatic cancer samples collected following diagnosis, achieving an average test AUROCs of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.97) respectively. In our current studies, we focus specifically on breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer cases, and are extending this to further pan-cancer applications in subsequent investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8206e613-82f0-4926-8d5d-484b5af3e48e\/@w03B8ZB6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Pancreatic cancer,Prostate cancer,Cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12752"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicholas Cheng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Soave<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Skead<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Ouellette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Bratman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel De Carvalho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Awadalla<\/i><\/presenter>.

Lynch Syndrome) as well as for monitoring response to cancer treatment. The frameshift mutation is associated with micro satellite instability (MSI) and is found in 80% of MSI-colorectal cancers (MSI-CRC) and in over 90% of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Here we show that cell free mutant (a9) TGF&#946;R2 DNA is present in liquid biopsies from MSI-CRC patients and that the a9 micro satellite of mutant TGF&#946;R2 can be selectively detected by using specially designed PCR primers modelled after the a9 microsatellite. PCR and primers defining a fragment of TGF&#946;R2 comprising the a10\/a9 microsatellite was used to amplify cfDNA extracted from MSI-CRC and microsatellite stable-CRC (MSS-CRC) patients. The resulting PCR products were analysed and confirmed by DNA sequencing after gel electrophoresis. In addition, primers modelled after the shorter a9 microsatellite was designed and tested using synthetic DNA of both TGF&#946;R2 variants. Despite the naturally established mismatch between the a10 sequence and primers modelled after the a9 sequence, conventionally designed primers could not differentiate enough for specific annealing to the a9 sequence. A further mismatch with the a10 sequence was introduced at the 3&#8217; end of the primer, which, in combination with the already established mismatch, denied the primer tail-end annellation with the a10 sequence that is necessary for polymerase amplification of this sequence. Experiments to optimise PCR conditions and buffer solution were conducted prior to analysing the cfDNA extracted from the patient samples. It was found that TGF&#946;R2 DNA was present in cfDNA from all (10\/10) CRC patients tested and that TGF&#946;R2 a10&#8594;a9 frameshift was present in all (5\/5) MSI-CRC patients and none (0\/5) of MSS-CRC patients tested, shown by sequencing. PCR using the selected a9 modelled primer yielded a PCR product that was clearly detectable on the electrophoresis gel only for cfDNA from the MSI-CRC patients (5\/5). The results show that TGF&#946;R2 a10&#8594;a9 frameshift DNA is present in cfDNA of liquid biopsies from MSI-CRC patients which establishes cell free TFG&#946;R2 frameshift DNA as a potential biomarker for early detection of hereditary CRC (Lynch Syndrome) as well as for monitoring cancer progression and remission of sporadic MSI-CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d73f3565-fa88-4bab-a614-7f4057ebfafa\/@x03B8ZB7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Cell-free DNA,Mutation detection,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12753"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Henrik K.

To reduce the incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer, it is crucial to timely identify and optimally treat its precursors. One such precursor is intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) as some of these cyst lesions have potential to progress to invasive cancer. Current clinical guidelines for predicting and treating malignant IPMN have a satisfactory sensitivity (&#62;90%) but a dismal specificity (25-30%), leading to a number of unnecessary pancreatic resections in benign IPMN. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to identify molecular biomarkers to improve malignant IPMN prediction. The present study was thus conducted to identify metabolomic biomarkers that can preoperatively differentiate malignant IPMN from benign IPMN. A global plasma metabolomic analysis of 607 metabolites was performed on Xevo GS-X2 quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers (MS) using a 2D column configuration in 125 cases of low\/moderate-grade IPMN and 50 cases of high-grade\/invasive IPMN, confirmed by surgical pathology. Of the 607 metabolites, 19 were selected based on their p values for the differences between the two groups compared (all p&#60;0.005). All potential combinations (1 to 8 metabolites) of the 19 metabolites were examined by 3-fold cross validation. The training and test sets included 67% and 33% of total samples, respectively, while keeping the same ratio of low\/moderate-grade IPMN to high-grade\/invasive IPMN. We repeated such cross validation 100 times by random selection of the training and test sets. The metabolite combination that can distinguish malignant IPMN from benign IPMN with the highest average AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristics<b> <\/b>curve) (=0.70) consisted of four lipid-related metabolites. AUCs (95% CIs) were 0.63 (0.53 - 0.72), 0.64 (0.55 - 0.73), 0.65 (0.56 - 0.74), and 0.64 (0.54 - 0.73) for the metabolites 1-4, respectively. CA19-9 is the only established biomarker for pancreatic cancer. As shown above, AUCs for the four individual metabolites and for their combination were greater than the AUC of CA19-9 [0.58 (0.47 - 0.69)]. Adding the four metabolites and CA19-9 to the model that contained clinical and imaging variables (including age, sex, BMI, main pancreatic duct diameter, and radiographic main duct involvement) yielded an AUC (95% CI) of 0.82 (0.75 - 0.90). In summary, we identified a plasma signature of four metabolites that outperformed CA19-9 in the discrimination of malignant IPMN from benign IPMN. If replicated in other independent patient populations, the findings of the present study can aid in the risk stratification of IPMN patients prior to surgery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b82cb0b4-8069-4ff7-9f8e-3fe737c9a6bc\/@x03B8ZB7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Predictive biomarkers,Metabolomics,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12754"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Johannes Fahrmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Yip-Schneider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huangbing Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ziyue Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Wan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheng Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samir Hanash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>C.

Most of the PDAC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, and less than 20% of patients are resectable at the time of diagnosis. The current imaging tools and blood markers (e.g. CA 19-9), are inadequate for early disease detection due to their poor specificity and sensitivity. This highlights the need to develop robust, noninvasive biomarkers for early detection of PDAC. While a large body of literature supports the use of cell-free miRNAs (cf-miRNAs) as potential diagnostic biomarkers in cancer, their tumor specificity is often debatable. Given the emerging evidence that exosomal cargo is a more robust representation of individual tumor types, in this study we sought to explore the diagnostic potential of cf-miRNAs along with exosomal miRNAs (exo-miRNAs), to establish a non-invasive miRNA signature for the early detection of PDAC.<br \/>Methods: As part of the NCI&#8217;s Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC) funded project, in this study, small RNA-sequencing was performed in exosome and cell-free (cf) samples from a cohort of 57 PDAC cases and 57 non-disease controls. Using rigorous bioinformatic and biostatistical approaches, we prioritized a panel of cf- and exo-miRNAs and evaluated its diagnostic performance in the sequencing-based discovery and validation cohorts. Subsequently, the performance of the discovered miRNA panel was validated using qRT-PCR assays in an independent clinical validation cohort of PDAC patients and non-disease controls (n=48\/each group). The results were examined by ROC curve analysis to determine the diagnostic power of the biomarker panel individually and in combination for their ability to discriminate PDAC from controls.<br \/>Results: The genomewide transcriptomic analyses led to the identification of a panel of 13 cf-miRNA and 17 exo-miRNA candidates. Sequencing validation in an independent cohort revealed that a combined panel of cf and exo-miRNAs exhibited an area under curve (AUC) of 0.89. Subsequent risk score analysis demonstrated that our biomarker signature was also robust in the identification of PDAC patients with early-stage cancers (stage I &#38; II) vs. controls (p &#60;0.001). Moreover, when we combined the miRNA biomarker panel with CA19-9 values, the diagnostic performance was significantly superior when compared to the biomarker panel alone. Finally, the validation efforts in clinical cohorts by qRT-PCR revealed that the combined miRNA panel yielded an impressive accuracy with an AUC of 0.91, and a sensitivity of 0.88 and specificity of 0.87.<br \/>Conclusions: In conclusion, we report a novel, exosome-based miRNA signature for the early detection of patients with PDAC; which could potentially improve early-detection efforts for this fatal malignancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d6b2b13d-723b-42fc-9cf8-676c3ef6ee7d\/@x03B8ZB7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Exosomes,Liquid biopsies,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12758"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kota Nakamura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Souvick Roy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhongxu Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunsung Jun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiyong Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruben M.

Previous studies have presented sensitive methods for detection of ctDNA in early-stage cancer, but very few have been validated in asymptomatic individuals e.g. a true screening setting. Furthermore, many methods rely on expensive sequencing-based approaches that may not be cost-effective for population-based screening. Recently, we developed TriMeth, a simple CRC-specific ctDNA detection test based on three DNA methylation markers, which showed a sensitivity of 85% (stage I: 80%, stage II: 85%, stage III: 89%, stage IV: 88%) and a specificity of 99% when evaluated in CRC patients and controls (n=434).<br \/><b>Objective:<\/b> This study aimed to assess the performance of TriMeth cell-free DNA methylation analysis in asymptomatic individuals.<br \/><b>Methods and materials:<\/b> TriMeth was evaluated in 727 average-risk, asymptomatic individuals from the Danish population-based CRC screening program aged 50-74 years. This cohort included 105 CRC patients (stage I: n=53, stage II: n=24, stage III: n=19, stage IV: n=9) and 622 age and gender-matched controls enriched for comorbidities common to the screening population, such as, diabetes (n=47), arthritis (n=9), hypertension (n=279), arteriosclerosis (n=90), inflammatory bowel disease (n=6), adenomas (n=49), and other cancers (n=91). For comparison, TriMeth was also applied to a cohort of 43 symptomatic CRC patients and 42 cancer-free controls.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In the asymptomatic cohort, the specificity was consistently high (99%) despite the enrichment for controls with comorbidities in this cohort. The sensitivity was 36%, and was reduced for all disease stages compared to symptomatic cancers, though most markedly reduced for stage I CRC (stage I: 9%, stage II: 67%, stage III: 53%, stage IV: 78%). For a subset of asymptomatic individuals (n=91), an additional aliquot of plasma was analyzed, revealing a very high reproducibility of TriMeth (Spearman corr.coeff. r=0.95, p=7.6e-14). However, merging data from the paired samples did not significantly increase sensitivity. TriMeth showed consistently high accuracy in the symptomatic cohort (sensitivity: 84% and specificity: 100%).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> TriMeth is highly specific and not affected by comorbidities commonly found in 50-74 years old individuals invited for CRC screening. TriMeth showed high sensitivity for all stages when evaluated in symptomatic CRC patients, but the sensitivity was significantly decreased in asymptomatic cancers, also when stage-stratified. This indicate that asymptomatic cancers, independent of stage, shed less ctDNA than symptomatic cancers and highlights the importance of evaluating methods for early cancer detection in asymptomatic individuals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0cc50fe-ad60-43dc-9d31-12652a775e3d\/@x03B8ZB7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Early detection,DNA methylation,Cancer markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12761"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah Østrup Jensen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadia Øgaard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mai-britt Worm Ørntoft<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mads Heilskov Rasmussen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesper Bertram Bramsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Therkildsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claus Lindbjerg Andersen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Time consuming, custom dissociation protocols performed on fresh tissue by experts are often utilized to obtain high quality single cell data. However, these complex protocols result in low sample throughput and high variability driven by logistical challenges and user variability. Additionally, many samples that are of interest for clinical and translational studies arrive in research labs snap frozen, leaving nuclei extraction as the only viable path to generate single cell\/nuclei data. To overcome these challenges, we present a scalable, easy to use, spin column-based nuclei isolation platform that generates single nuclei that are ready for input into downstream 10x Genomics single cell assays in under an hour.<br \/>We processed eight unique human tumors in parallel (skin melanoma, breast, ovary, prostate, lung, kidney, colorectal, and pancreas). Starting from snap frozen tissue, we were able to generate single nuclei suspensions for all samples, in parallel, within 90 minutes. The resulting single nuclei were run through the 10x Genomics Single Cell Gene Expression, Single Cell Immune Profiling, and Single Cell ATAC workflows.<br \/>Single cell gene expression data retained high data complexity across all tumor types tested. Expected cell type clusters, including tissue-specific tumor cells, surrounding\/infiltrating immune cells and stromal cells were easily identified and profiled via gene expression analysis. Even fragile cell types often missing in single-cell data (e.g. mature adipocytes) were preserved and profiled in this experiment. Additionally, epigenetic changes as measured by Single Cell ATAC profiling were consistent with both general and tissue-specific epigenetics of each cancer type analyzed.<br \/>In summary, this platform streamlines sample preparation for single cell studies from snap frozen tissue, enabling these samples to be used much more routinely and unlock biobanked sample cohorts. The findings presented here demonstrate that this fast and easy to use nuclei isolation system provides a consistent platform for generating high quality single nuclei data at scale for clinical, translational and basic research studies alike.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e9b547ee-4602-413b-a495-15a92d8b62de\/@x03B8ZB7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Sequencing,Differential gene expression,Solid Tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12817"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Gibbons<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alaina Puleo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jill Herschleb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Taylor<\/i><\/presenter>. 10x Genomics Inc, Pleasanton, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a949889c-df3a-4c1e-9ce4-92f041799e01","ControlNumber":"5697","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.
