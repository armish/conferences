Despite the advancements in neurosurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, one-year survival of metastatic brain tumor patients still within a single digit such that brain metastases constitute about 20% of annual cancer deaths. These facts clearly indicate a critical need for better understanding of mechanisms that promote the growth of brain metastases. Emerging data, including ours, indicate that different types of metastatic cancer cells leverage dissimilar sets of neurotransmitters to favor their outgrowth in the brain. However, there are over sixty types of neurotransmitters in the brain being synthesized and released by various types of neural cells, we need a systemic investigation of how they mediate the pathogenesis of brain metastases in concert. Since neurotransmitters, gliotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, and neural cytokines, called neuroactive substances, are the most abundant and key intercellular communication signals in the brain, we hypothesize that tumor cells leverage these neuroactive substances to assimilate into neural circuitry via communicating with neural cells including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte, and others, in promoting the vicious circle of tumor-neural crosstalk during brain metastasis development. By performing spatial transcriptomics analysis on mouse brain sections bearing metastatic tumors, we found that tumor lesions at different locations and even tumor-surrounding areas in the brain regions could be differentiated into different cellular clusters based on gene transcriptomic expressions. We further predicted several paracrine and autocrine signaling between and within tumors as well as tumor-surrounding neural niches in different tumor locations (e.g., centers or edges), of different tumor sizes, and at various tumor development stages, using our Cell-Cell Communication Explorer (CCC-Explorer) modeling software. Functional experiments were conducted to demonstrate that cell type-specific depletion of the secreted NSs deactivated the activities of corresponding receptors and downstream signaling in co-cultured metastatic brain tumor cells. Characterizing spatiotemporal tumor-neural crosstalk in the brain metastatic niche would provide a new strategy in the development of novel and effective therapeutics of brain metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Spatial transcriptomics,computational modeling,Cell-cell interaction,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianting Sheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Hong Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Wong<\/i><\/presenter>.

At present, CHIP is diagnosed using peripheral blood where putative driver point mutations and small insertions\/deletions whose variant allele frequency is greater or equal to two percent. Generally, the prevalence of CH increases as an individual ages and conveys a risk for progression to a malignancy. Previously, we developed a method using fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites to serve as a fluctuating methylation clock to uncover stem cell dynamics in glandular tissues and orthogonally validated our method using publicly available datasets of human blood from normal cohorts and malignant cohorts. Here we expand on this work by presenting 38 new patients with distinct VAF groups from 1-2% VAF up to greater than 10% VAF for putative drivers with corresponding DNA methylation profiles using the Illumina EPIC array platform. We identify fCpG from our normal and CHIP cohorts to train and validate a machine learning method that allows us to diagnose CHIP without DNA sequencing. This method allows for the identification of patients who may have CH driven by structural variants such as copy number variants. We use this method to examine a cohort of 656 normal patients without evidence of CHIP based on mutation showing that we identify the presence of CHIP roughly a third of these patients. Clonal hematopoiesis is driven by the underlying hematopoietic stem cells of an unknown quantity, with estimates for stim cell numbers differing by orders of magnitude.Finally, using a mechanistic model of clonal hematopoeisis and fCpGs we examine the temporal ability to diagnose CHIP given single and multiple expanding clones. We illustrate that multiple driver mutations within the same clone leads to an increased detection ability with an increased expansion rate (i.e. fitness) and in cases where drivers are found in separate, competing clones.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Diagnosis,Methylation,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan O.

In this presentation we explore similarities found across species when associating cancer biomarkers and outcomes. Our findings validate concordance across the cancer journeys. This is important to deepen the field of comparative oncology and affirming spontaneous cancer in dogs as an ideal &#8216;model&#8217; for precision oncology, building upon recent work in tumor biology concordance. Our machine learning analysis prognosis and predictive effect of genomic alterations in 1303 client-owned tumor-bearing dogs identified TP53 and PTPRD as prognostic markers for poor survival in dogs with an overall survival hazard ratio (OS HR) of 1.732, 1.914, respectively (P&#60;0.001 and P=0.023). These results are aligned with non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic breast cancer and pancreatic cancer in people correlated with poor survival when carrying TP53 mutation, and PTPRD also correlated with poor survival in gliomas. Besides that, we also identified ALB1 and PIK3CA prognostic markers for poor survival in canine tumors with an overall survival hazard ratio (OS HR) of 1.707, 1.689, respectively (P=0.01, and P=0.002). This data reaffirms the similarity between canine and human cancers not just in the genomic profiles but also the tumor biology and treatment strategy for both species. Among tumor types, lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma showed the worst survival times (N=32, OS HR=1.929, P=0.002, and N=202, OS HR=1.743, P&#60;0.001). Interestingly, we also identified that dogs with RET mutations respond better to toceranib, a veterinary oral multikinase inhibitor against RET, VEGFR2, PDGFR, FLT3 and c-KIT; this is in concordance with sunitinib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that target RET used in humans thyroid carcinomas and other tumors carrying RET mutations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest canine tumor clinical genomic dataset analysis. Applying real-world evidence and data tools in the FidoCure&#174; dataset, we successfully identified associations between gene mutations and survival associated with response to target therapy treatment. These associations can benefit dogs by enabling better therapeutic recommendations and also benefit human cancer research since canine models recapitulate human disease with intact immune systems and similar tumor genomic profiles, confirmed by the FidoCure&#174; database, accelerating clinical studies of novel treatments that currently have significant barriers to study at scale.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anticancer therapy,Genomics,TP53,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kevin Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucas Rodrigues<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerald Post<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Garrett Harvey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aubrey Miller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsay Lambert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Lopes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Lewis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Zou<\/i><\/presenter>.

One continued challenge is to build models that are not only predictive but also provide mechanistic explanations. Directly incorporating explainability into the model&#8217;s design has emerged as a possible solution. Recently, we reported several &#8220;visible&#8221; machine learning systems - DCell and DrugCell - which predict cellular growth based on genetic perturbations. In these visible models, the structure of the underlying neural network mirrors known aspects of cell biology. Here we designed a cancer-specific model of therapeutic response. First, we selected NeST (Nested Systems in Tumors; Zheng et al., Science 2021), a data-driven hierarchy of tumor cell systems under selection in cancer, as the structure for our visible neural network. Second, we restricted input features to genes currently assayed on clinical cancer gene panels. We considered training schemes that assess the model&#8217;s ability to generalize to novel genotypes. Most importantly, we assessed performance on patient data from the AACR Project GENIE clinical trial where we discriminated between patients who are likely to respond to selected drug treatments. Finally, we examined model explanations within the visible NeST architecture to highlight cellular mechanisms of response to drug therapy. Overall, we found that by considering a tumor cell architecture optimized for clinical application, we can design an interpretable deep learning model that both accurately stratifies patient responses and explains the drug mechanism in cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Deep learning,Data-driven hierarchy,Explainable AI,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erica N.

We apply this technology to deliver an approach to examine pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) to identify intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that are associated with the progression of these pre-malignant lesions to invasive carcinoma. Currently, most pancreatic cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage that reflects in dismal survival rates and a better understanding of PanINs biology will provide valuable insights for early therapeutic interventions. Thus, we used PanINs as our model system to implement the FFPE ST workflow. Our workflow for FFPE ST analysis facilitates sectioning of small regions (5mm in diameter) from a paraffin block that are stained and imaged with H&#38;E and concurrently measured for genome-wide transcriptional profiling. Subsequently, the image is used for automated cell annotation using an algorithm, CODA, trained to identify normal and neoplastic pancreatic cell types. CODA identified the normal pancreatic histological regions (ducts, acini, islets of Langerhans, stroma), as well as the neoplastic cells. This automated analysis enables isolation of specific spots for differential expression analysis to pinpoint the transcriptional changes that occur within neoplastic cells along ducts in PanIn and their changes between high-grade and low-grade lesions. The spatial gene expression analysis identified clusters that mapped to the cell types annotated by CODA and the marker genes of each cluster matched known markers for the correspondent cell type. Although PanINs are very small in size (&#60; 1mm), we found specific clusters accurately mapped to these lesions in each sample. Overall, the spatial sequencing data presented enough depth and complexity to allow differential expression and pathway analysis. We observed a significant number of deregulated genes in PanINs compared to normal ducts. Some deregulated genes are known PanIN markers, but potential new markers were also identified. Moreover, the integration of CODA with gene expression changes enables us to verify that unique stromal regions annotated with CODA and associated with PanIns are in fact heterogeneous and formed by distinct cell subtypes. Altogether, our workflow combining automated cell annotation with STA from the same section provides a methodology to precisely examine the sample architecture while measuring heterogeneity at the transcriptional level. This combined approach can be applied to different FFPE tumor types to leverage the use of large bioarchives of samples not previously accessible to genome-wide spatial methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Premalignancy,Gene expression,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Alexander T.

However, existing model development approaches require long periods of culture time during which evolutionary pressures reduce heterogeneity. It also remains difficult to create long-term models of many cancers, greatly limiting the share of patient samples that can be studied. These limitations make it challenging to create large and diverse datasets for the discovery and validation of biomarker-vulnerability relationships. To enable high-throughput genetic and pharmacological screens in primary, including nondividing, cells without an intermediate model generation step, we are developing a label-free imaging-based platform of early living tissue perturbation. Here, we describe our efforts to establish an<i> ex vivo<\/i> cell-preservation and imaging system for malignant ascites from patients with advanced gastroesophageal (GE) cancer, whose prognosis remains poor and there is an urgent need for rapid evidence-based therapeutic discovery. First, we optimized a workflow to acquire and perturb cells within 24 hours of sample collection. We observed that incorporating microenvironmental factors by mixing ascites fluid with organoid media extends the preservation of cellular composition and viability. We next hypothesized that label-free microscopy can be a substitute for fluorescence-based labels which fade over time in live-cell imaging. To test this, we created a dataset consisting of over 1.0M cells from 14 samples (10 unique patients). Before seeding, we added fluorescence labels to annotate cell type and viability during imaging. We then trained predictive models to infer cell annotations based on brightfield morphological features only and observed an overall accuracy of 92% and 82% for cell identity and viability, respectively. Prediction of tumor cell fraction from label-free images alone showed strong correlation with tumor fractions estimated by flow cytometry. We also integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data to generate a candidate panel of 28 compounds which are predicted to exhibit antitumor activity via different mechanisms that are of relevance to our study cohort. We observe that label-free inference of compound activity showed strong correlation (R<sup>2<\/sup> &#62; 0.8) with fluorescent-based methods. We are now expanding the scale of our rapid screens and utilizing transcriptomics to link the molecular profile with response. Since our approach couples the timing of drug or genetic perturbation with the preservation of subcellular heterogeneity, it will serve as a strong foundation for preclinical studies. Importantly, our method substantially expands the fraction of samples that can be interrogated and will have application in other areas of need where material is limited or long-term model generation remains unsuccessful as is the case in many rare diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Drug sensitivity,Tumor heterogeneity,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mushriq Al-Jazrawe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Csaba Molnar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niklas Rindtorff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Blum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Colgan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Alimova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean Misek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Rios<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moony Tseng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James M.
