[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Active duty military service members and the general US population differ in several ways related to cancer occurrence. This study aimed to update and expand our previous study which compared incidence of six cancers between the U.S. military and general populations.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Cancers included in this study were pathologically confirmed malignant lung, colorectal, testicular, prostate, cervical and breast tumors diagnosed 1990-2013. The study populations were men and women aged 20-59 in the US active duty military and the population in nine areas covered by the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry program. Military data were from the Department of Defense&#8217;s Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR) and Defense Manpower Data Center. Age adjusted rates in ACTUR and SEER and incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) comparing ACTUR to SEER were calculated. Comparisons were made by sex, race, and cancer stage.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Age adjusted incidence rates of colorectal cancer were significantly lower in ACTUR than SEER among White (IRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.72-0.84) and Black men (IRR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-1.00), respectively. Lung cancer incidence was lower in ACTUR than SEER among White (IRR 0.55; 95% CI 0.49-0.62) and Black men (IRR 0.34; 95% CI 0.26-0.42) and White women (IRR 0.74; 95% CI 0.53-0.98). Whites in ACTUR had significantly lower incidence of testicular cancer (IRR 0.92; 95% CI 0.88-0.96). Lower incidence of cervical cancer in ACTUR was observed among both Whites (IRR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69-0.97) and Blacks (IRR 0.39; 95% CI 0.27-0.54). Incidence of prostate cancer was higher in ACTUR than SEER among both Whites (IRR 2.31; 95% CI 2.18-2.45) and Blacks (IRR 2.35; 95% CI 2.13-2.58). Results by tumor stage showed similar results between the ACTUR and SEER populations for regional and distant tumors, while no differences between the two were observed for localized tumors, except in the case of prostate cancer. Incidence of localized and regional prostate tumors was higher in ACTUR than SEER, while there was no significant difference in distant tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Active duty service members had lower age adjusted incidence rates of colorectal, lung, testicular, and cervical cancers, but higher rates of prostate cancer than the general US population. While these findings may result from the combined effects of many factors, the lower incidence in the military may be associated with healthier status of service members. In addition, universal health care for active duty military may lead to earlier diagnosis of some tumors, such as prostate cancer, in the military.<br \/><b>Disclaimer:<\/b> The contents of this publication are the sole responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions or policies of USUHS, HJF, the DoD or the Departments of the Army, Navy or Air Force.

Several studies have found that most Southern urban women lacked knowledge of <i>Human papillomavirus <\/i>(HPV) and had never been screened for cervical cancer, however, no studies have been conducted in Southern rural areas. We therefore conducted a cross-sectional study aimed at exploring awareness of HPV and attitudes toward and experience with cervical cancer screening among rural women in Southern Vietnam. We were particularly interested in whether HPV self-sampling was acceptable in this population.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In October and November 2021, 198 women aged 28-65 living in the rural Can Gio district of Ho Chi Minh City were recruited for the study. Participants were asked to complete an HPV awareness questionnaire in Vietnamese. They then watched four short Vietnamese dubbed and subbed videos demonstrating cervical cancer screening methods (Pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid application [VIA], HPV sampling by a physician, and HPV self-sampling) before answering questions about their views and experience with each screening method. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate differences in HPV awareness and screening history by age, marital status, religion, education level and household income. Logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between and trends in HPV awareness and screening experience with age, education level and income.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of the 198 participants, 67 (34%) had ever heard of HPV. Women with higher education levels and higher income were more likely to have heard of HPV (p-trend&#60;0.001 and 0.027, respectively). There was no difference in having heard of HPV by marital status (p=0.99), religion (p=0.20), or age (p-trend=0.51). Less than half of the participants (n=85; 43%) had ever been screened for cervical cancer; the was no association between being screened and age, marital status, religion, education level or income. Among women who had been screened for cervical cancer (n=85), the most common method was Pap smears (n=69; 81%), followed by HPV testing with a sample collected by a physician (n=20; 24%), VIA (n=15; 18%), and HPV self-sampling (n=2; 2%). Some women had been screened with multiple methods. Among all women, 84% reported being willing to have a Pap smear (n=167) whereas only 40% indicated they would be interested in HPV self-sampling (n=79). The most common concerns regarding HPV self-sampling included: self-collecting incorrectly (n=158; 80%), pain (n=106; 54%), and fear of the test revealing that they had cancer (n=91; 46%).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Rural women in Southern Vietnam lacked knowledge of HPV, however 43% had been screened for cervical cancer. Education programs are needed to increase awareness of HPV, and address the concerns regarding HPV self-sampling given its potential to increase screening uptake in low-resource areas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0cc2071-594d-4da4-b270-1d825491b2e7\/@x03B8ZCY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-21 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Low-middle income country,cervical cancer screening,screening barriers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13509"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Minh Tung Phung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong H.T.C.

Given the significantly higher emotional difficulties among SGM cancer patients and adverse impact of psychosocial vulnerabilities on patient outcomes, understanding of unique concerns related to physical\/emotional health and QoL among SGM cancer patients is an unmet need. The current study analyzed the association between psychosocial concerns and QoL by SGM status.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Participants (N=70,312) were cancer patients who completed a standard-of-care electronic patient questionnaire (EPQ) during their initial visits at the Moffitt Cancer Center. The EPQ captures patient-reported information on demographics (including sexual orientation and gender identity [SOGI]), medical history, family cancer history, lifestyle factors, use of complementary and alternative medicine, and QoL. The SOGI questions were used to identify SGM and non-SGM patients. The outcome variables were concerns in (1) having someone who can help the patient during treatment, (2) interference with ability to seek care (e.g., transportation, financial), (3) problems with work or other regular activities due to physical\/emotional health and pain over the past 4 weeks, and (4) perceived general health. Pearson&#8217;s Chi-Square test and ANOVA were utilized; significance was determined by <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Approximately 2.3% of the population self-identified as an SGM.

These results add to the existing literature by elucidating potential difficulties in cancer treatment and preexisting interference due to emotional difficulties and pain among SGM cancer patients with heterogeneous cancer types. Further research is warranted in the short- and long-term impact of such concerns on cancer outcomes and potential need for early intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a4fff78-ab9e-400f-ab90-342c5048bd85\/@x03B8ZCY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-19 Psychosocial and behavioral epidemiology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stress response,Epidemiology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13506"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Min-Jeong Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaileene Pérez-Morales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jarred D.

Puberty is a well-established sensitive period in women when breast cancer (BC) risk is increased by the physical environment for example exposure to chemical carcinogens, synthetic estrogens, endocrine disrupters, radiation, etc. However, relatively little is known about effects of exposure to chronic psychological stress from the social environment during this time period (puberty and early adulthood). In previous studies using the Sprague-Dawley rat model of spontaneous mammary cancer, chronically heightened glucocorticoid stress reactivity arising from imposed social isolation after weaning increased duration of glucocorticoid release in response to everyday stressors, impeded mammary gland ductal development, and caused earlier and more aggressive mammary gland cancer incidence during adulthood. However due to the period of isolation lasting from weaning to death, a critical time period in which these changes occurred was not established. Here we found that chronic social isolation only during puberty and early adulthood results in alterations in mammary gland gene expression patterns and preservation of mammary stem\/progenitor cells. We have observed that social isolation beginning at five weeks and ending at 21 weeks leads to a 4-fold increase in the key metabolic lipogenic enzymes ATP citrate lyase (ACLY; p-value = 0.008), 2-fold increase in acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acaca; p-value=0.01), and 1.88-fold change in stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1; p-value = 0.50). Interestingly, we have also observed that social isolation during this time period, leads to a slight decrease (0.70-fold change) in hexokinase 2 (HK2; p-value= 0.007). Regarding mammary stem\/progenitor cell preservation, we found that social isolation beginning at five weeks and ending at 17 weeks leads to a significant increase in the number of mammary gland stem\/progenitor cells (isolated by FACS sorting). This correlation was only observed in response to corticosterone reactivity, and null to exposure to estrogen or progesterone. In summary, our findings suggest that social isolation during puberty and early adulthood correlates to increased glucocorticoid exposure resulting in metabolic reprogramming in the mammary gland and inappropriate preservation of mammary stem\/progenitor cells. Altogether these factors may increase the risk of mammary cancer occurrence later in adulthood.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a14cb955-8399-495c-a552-d9d4569a2793\/@y03B8ZCZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-10 Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Gene expression,Epigenetics,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13584"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Briana Banks<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianna Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joscelyn Hoffmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannah You<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matt Piron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne Conzen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martha McClintock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Brady<\/i><\/presenter>.

Firefighters have been shown to be occupationally exposed to PFAS through aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used during difficult-to-suppress fires, and in the textile liners of their safety turnout gear. PFASs have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical structures, giving them strong thermal stability and making them resistant to environmental and physiological degradation. Studies of human exposures to PFAS have observed associations between some PFAS and increased risk of obesity or elevated body mass index (BMI). Given the unique occupational exposures of firefighters to PFAS, we examine the association between obesity and PFAS in a sample of Florida firefighters.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods: <\/b>A cross-sectional study design was used to collect a health survey and a blood sample from a non-probabilistic sample of career Florida fighters between June and October 2021. The health surveys, administered on REDCap using tablet devices, assessed information on firefighter socio-demographic and work characteristics. We quantified 7 distinct PFASs using a solid-phase extraction-high-performance liquid chromatography-isotope dilution-tandem mass spectrometry approach; the limit of detection was between 0.5 and 0.05 ng\/mL, depending on the analyte. All 7 PFASs, including Perfluorobutanesulfonic Acid (PFBS), Perfluoroheptanoic Acid (PFHpA), Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid (PFHxS), Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFNA), Perfluorononanoic Acid (PFNA), Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid (PFOS), and Perfluoroctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), were detected in the blood samples; concentrations below the limit of detection were replaced by the limit of detection\/&#8730;2.35.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among the 208 firefighters who completed the survey and provided a blood sample, 92.8% were male, 16.2% Hispanic\/Latinx, 81.7% White, 89.8% used AFFF at their fire department, with a group mean age 40.2&#177;10.3 standard deviation. Approximately 15.8% of firefighters were of healthy weight, 51.5% overweight, and 32.7% obese. Firefighter body mass index was positively correlated with serum concentrations of PFHxS (r<sub>s<\/sub>=.17;p=.020) and PFBS (r<sub>s<\/sub>=.60;p=.26). Group geometric mean of each PFAS congener (in ng\/mL): PFBS (0.09), PFHpA (0.08), PFHxS (2.17), PFOA (1.38), PFNA (0.42), PFOS (2.69), and PFOSA (0.10). Total serum PFAS concentrations was highest among obese firefighters (7.62 ng\/mL) and lowest in healthy weight firefighters (6.55 ng\/mL).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Firefighters who were overweight and obese, based on body mass index, had higher total serum PFAS concentrations than those firefighters of healthy weight.

Though often pooled in epidemiological analyses, the U.S. Hispanic population is very diverse, and registry-based analyses may mask incidence and survival differences associated with geographic\/ancestral origins.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> County-level glioma incidence data in U.S. Hispanics from 2000-2017 were retrieved from the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, and survival data from the CDC&#8217;s National Program of Cancer Registries was obtained for 2001-2017. American Community Survey data were used to determine county-level proportion of the Hispanic population of Mexican\/Central-American origin and of Caribbean origin (Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican). State-level estimates of European and African admixture in Hispanics were obtained from published 23andMe data. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) quantified the glioma incidence differences across groups. County-level incidence was modeled using linear regression to control for potential confounding factors (<i>e.g.<\/i>, county size, median socioeconomic status), and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations between individual-level survival, county-level origin percentages, and state-level admixture.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Compared to Hispanics living in predominantly Caribbean-origin counties, Hispanics from predominantly Mexican\/Central-American-origin counties had lower age-adjusted risks of glioma (IRR=0.83; P&#60;0.0001), glioblastoma (IRR=0.86; P&#60;0.0001), diffuse\/anaplastic astrocytoma (IRR=0.78; P&#60;0.0001), oligodendroglioma (IRR=0.82; P&#60;0.0001), ependymoma (IRR=0.88; P=0.012), and pilocytic astrocytoma (IRR=0.76; P&#60;0.0001). Associations were consistent in children and adults, and using more granular geographic regions. Despite having lower glioma incidence, Hispanic glioblastoma patients from predominantly Mexican\/Central-American-origin counties had poorer survival than Hispanics living in predominantly Caribbean-origin counties. Incidence and survival differences could be partially explained by state-level estimates of European and African admixture in Hispanics, with European admixture associated with higher incidence and African admixture associated with improved survival.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS: <\/b>Glioma incidence and outcomes differ in association with the geographic origins of the Hispanic community, with residents of predominantly Mexican\/Central-American-origin counties at significantly reduced risk and those of Caribbean-origin counties at comparatively greater risk. Although typically classified as a single ethnic group in registry data, appreciating the cultural, socioeconomic, and genetic diversity of U.S. Hispanics will help advance cancer disparities research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0828c3af-b1f0-4ebf-9ad7-05fc0ac6ec4a\/@y03B8ZCZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Glioblastoma,Epidemiology,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13450"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kyle M.

Immunosuppression and dysregulation of the immune system promote the development of certain cancers, particularly hematological malignancies. There is also evidence on an increased risk of several types of solid tumors among individuals with an AD. The aim of this population-based cohort study was to evaluate the risk of any cancer, except non-melanoma skin cancer, in 31 different ADs. We explored associations between both common (such as rheumatoid arthritis) and rare (such as Behcet&#8217;s disease) ADs and cancer.<br \/><b>Material and methods: <\/b>The data consists of a population-based random sample of 2.5 million individuals who lived in Finland on January 1, 2000. It includes information on hospital diagnoses between 1970 and 2017 for each individual, with a total of 92 million hospital care records. There were 70 694 individuals with prevalent AD and 68 002 individuals with prevalent cancer. Those with prevalent cancer were removed from the analyses. Participants were followed up for subsequent occurrence of cancer, based on data from the nationwide cancer registry. We estimated relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using piecewise constant hazard regression models, adjusting for age, sex, and calendar period. Time since AD diagnosis was treated as a time-varying covariate.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>During the follow-up, 222 211 primary cancers were diagnosed, 18 409 with and 203 802 without a pre-existing AD. Overall, the risk of cancer was 2.02 (95% CI 1.93-2.12) for &#60;1 year since any AD diagnosis and 1.05 (1.03-1.07) for &#8805;10 years since diagnosis. The largest increase in cancer risk was observed for individuals with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and there was evidence of a persisting risk even after 10 years since diagnosis (RR 8.53 (6.76-10.77) for &#60;1 year since diagnosis and 1.62 (1.18-2.24) for &#8805;10 years since diagnosis). Long-term impact on cancer risk was also observed for autoimmune vasculitis, Crohn's disease, discoid lupus erythematosus, pemphigus, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis. For individuals with these ADs, cancer risk was still elevated after 10 or more years after AD diagnosis.<br \/><b>Discussion: <\/b>Cancer incidence was greatly dependent on AD duration. Cancer risk was increased soon (&#60;1 year) after AD diagnosis in 24 different ADs and elevated risks were still observed after &#8805;10 years in 8 ADs.<br \/>Cancer and comorbid diseases may have partly shared etiologies. Many lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity are established causes of many common diseases. Also, AD treatments may in some cases be tumorigenic. In conclusion, many ADs were associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer long after diagnosis, and this should be considered in patient counseling and monitoring. The findings also encourage search for shared risk factors underlying both diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ab4de1c-6123-49ce-86ae-407b0211a0f2\/@y03B8ZCZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Comorbidity,Epidemiology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13459"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanna Heikkinen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomas Tanskanen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauri Sipilä<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janne Pitkäniemi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Novel approaches to risk variant discovery are needed to detect variants that have not been uncovered by linkage analysis or genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We approach risk variant discovery using Shared Genomic Segment analysis (SGS), a novel statistical genetics method that enables risk variant discovery in extended high-risk pedigrees.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The Utah Population Database (UPDB) is a population-based resource of over ten million individuals connected to the state of Utah, five million of whom are linked to a minimum of three generations of genealogy data. By linking this genealogy data with cancer data from the Utah Cancer Registry, we identified pedigrees with an excess risk of EOC. We generated germline genotyping data from cases (diagnosed 1983-2018) in a subset of these high-risk pedigrees, focusing on pedigrees well-suited for SGS (i.e., at least 3 cases separated by a total of at least 12 meioses). SGS identifies all runs of consecutive alleles that are shared identical-by-state by cases in a pedigree and determines which of these genomic segments are longer than would be expected by chance. These long segments are likely to be identical-by-descent, inherited from a common founder, and may harbor risk variants.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We successfully linked UPDB genealogy data to information from the Utah Cancer Registry to identify approximately 2,000 extended high-risk pedigrees with &#8805;5 ovarian cancer cases, an average of 7-10 meioses between pairs cases, and a statistically significant excess risk of ovarian cancer (&#945;=0.05). We obtained biospecimens for 141 cases in 36 of the most promising pedigrees (i.e., high familial standardized incidence ratio, <i>p-value<\/i>&#60;0.005, not attributable to known risk variants in <i>BRCA1 <\/i>or <i>BRCA2<\/i> as observed in<i> <\/i>first-, second- or third-degree relatives of EOC cases). We genotyped 96 out of the 141 cases in these pedigrees (68%). SGS analyses to identify genomic regions that may harbor risk variants are currently underway.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Using pedigrees identified in the UPBD, SGS has identified risk loci and novel risk variants for a number of diseases, including breast and hematologic cancers. We have identified a set of EOC high-risk pedigrees for SGS analysis and will leverage SGS to identify genomic regions that may harbor EOC risk variants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/481e6e3c-706b-461b-a87f-ab7a8d9a4f23\/@y03B8ZCZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Family history,Genetic factors,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13580"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mollie E.

Tumor-bearing mice when housed at standard temperature of 22&#176;Celsius (&#176;C) exhibited a pro-tumorigenic TME (with fewer CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T Cells and an increase in immunosuppressive cells) than mice housed at 30&#176;C. The incidence of cancer has been shown to be higher in colder climates. Achievement of pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for early stage breast cancer (BC) is associated with improved overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that pCR would be increased while mortality would be decreased in BC patients (pts) living in warmer climates.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A retrospective, population-based analysis was conducted utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) from 1996-2017 and National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004-2018, and average annual temperature (AAT) data from the National Centers for Environmental Information. Cut-offs for AAT were obtained using the Youden&#8217;s index (for pCR) and maximum log-rank (for OS and DSS) methods. Associations between AAT and both pCR and OS\/DSS were evaluated using logistic and Cox regression models, respectively, adjusting for confounders (age, race, education, insurance, BC subtype, treatment).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 1,209,332 and 270,496 stage I-III BC pts in the US were analyzed using NCDB and SEER, respectively. In NCDB, 52.1% were hormone receptor (HR)+\/HER2-, 8.6% triple negative (TNBC), 7.2% HR+\/HER2+ and 3.1% HR-\/HER2+ and 29% unknown. 37.7% received chemotherapy, 62.6% radiation and 94.3% surgery. 10.2% pts received NAC and 19.5% (19,021\/97,669) achieved pCR. The AAT ranged from 44.7&#176;Fahrenheit (&#176;F) to 62.3&#176;F with median 50.9&#176;F. When adjusting for covariates, pts in regions with AAT &#62; 60.9&#176;F, had a greater chance of achieving pCR compared to AAT &#60; 60.9&#176;F with odds ratio (OR) 1.12 (95% CI 1.07-1.18), p &#60;0.001. This was consistent in the TNBC and HR-\/HER2+ subgroups with OR 1.14 (95% CI 1.07-1.23) and 1.15 (95% CI 1.04-1.27), respectively. There was a 2% improvement in OS with every 5<sup>o<\/sup>F increment, HR 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99), p &#60; 0.001.

Segregation measures were calculated from census tract-level (2006-2010 American Community Survey and 2010 decennial census). We measured residential segregation using the % HL Gini coefficient, to capture variability of HL residents within the census tract, and the isolation index, to capture the probability that HL residents come into contact with other members of the same minority group. We measured racialized economic (race\/ethnicity + income) concentration using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE), to capture spatial social polarization at the extremes.

Overall prognosis for MM has improved significantly in recent decades. However, patients with MM are at risk of recurrent hospitalizations that are expensive for healthcare systems and are considered as a factor in quality-of-care indices. Nevertheless, studies on predictive factors for hospital readmissions and mortality in patients with MM are limited. Understanding these factors can expedite development of strategies to reduce readmission, healthcare costs, and mortality.<br \/>Methods: Utilizing the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD), we conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients admitted with MM between 2016 and 2018 across the United States. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the predictors of unplanned readmissions within 30 days and mortality.<br \/>Results: Of 20,362 patients hospitalized with MM, 25.5% were readmitted within the next 30 days. Mean length of stay was 10 days (95% CI 10.40-10.70). Total charge for index hospitalization was $ 120630 (95% CI 118456-122803.9). Predictors of early readmission included tumor lysis syndrome (P&#60;0.01; OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07-1.64), chronic kidney disease (P&#60;0.01; OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.28), and diabetes mellitus (P&#60;0.01; OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.19). In-hospital mortality for patients with MM was 6.54%. The predictors of inpatient mortality (Table 1) were sepsis (P&#60;0.01; OR 6.00, 95% CI 5.17-6.97), disseminated intravascular coagulation (P&#60;0.01; OR 4.05, 95% CI 2.64-6.21), acute stroke (P&#60;0.01; OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.32-4.09), and pulmonary embolism (P&#60;0.01; OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.40-3.35).<br \/>Conclusions: One in four patients admitted with MM was readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. These hospitalizations were lengthy and costly for the healthcare system. Infection, bleeding, and thromboembolic events were the leading predictors of mortality during hospital stays.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{6A865AE3-38E7-4405-85D8-787A9C74725D}\"><caption>Table 1.

There are no known etiologic or risk factors and no approved treatments for ME\/CFS. We conducted a molecular epidemiologic study to test the hypothesis that ME\/CFS may be an autoimmune disease (AID) and explore the link between ME\/CFS and cancer, specifically hematologic malignancies.<br \/>Methods: Our clinic-based study involved carefully selected cases with confirmed diagnosis of ME\/CFS (n=59) and healthy controls (n=54) frequency matched to cases on age, gender and ethnicity. During structured interviews, detailed multi-generation pedigrees, epidemiologic and medical questionnaires, and biospecimen were obtained on all subjects. Statistical analysis of pedigree data involved comparison of cases and controls with respect to the prevalence and cumulative incidence of AID and cancer among their first-degree relatives. For unadjusted analysis, risk ratios, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-values were calculated. For age-adjusted analyses, cumulative incidence estimates were compared using the log-rank test.<br \/>Results: The prevalence of AID was significantly higher among the first-degree relatives of cases compared to those of controls (OR=5.30; 95%CI: 1.83-15.38; p=0.001). The prevalence of AID among mothers was 14% for cases and 1.9% for controls (p=0.03). 11.2% of the first-degree relatives of cases had an AID compared to 3.1% of the relatives of controls (prevalence ratio=3.71; 95% CI: 1.74-7.88; p=0.0007). The cumulative incidence of AID among the first-degree relatives of ME\/CFS cases was 9.4% compared to 2.7% for those of the controls (p=0.0025). First-degree relatives of ME\/CFS cases had a significantly higher prevalence of any cancer compared to the relatives of unrelated controls (OR=4.06, 95%CI: 1.84-8.96, p=0.0005). Age-adjusted analysis revealed significantly higher (p=0.03) cumulative incidence of any cancer among the first-degree relatives of cases (20%) compared to the relatives of controls (15.4%). The cumulative incidence of hematologic cancers was also significantly higher among the relatives of cases (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: We found statistically significant increased risks of AID and cancer among the first-degree relatives of ME\/CFS cases. Our findings implicate immune dysregulation as an underlying mechanism, providing etiologic clues and leads for prevention. Given symptomatic similarities between &#8216;long COVID&#8217; and ME\/CFS, it is predicted that there will be a significant increase in incidence of ME\/CFS as the result of COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings may enable defining a subset of COVID-19 patients who could be at risk of developing ME\/CFS, and who may benefit from treatments used for certain AIDs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2220aba8-a971-494b-8458-cdc32d120143\/@z03B8ZD1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Immuno-oncology,Case-control study,Genetic susceptibility,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13582"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Roxana Moslehi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anil Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amiran Dzutsev<\/i><\/presenter>.

For example, we previously reported that Dominican pancreatic cancer patients had improved survival compared to other Hispanic groups. We sought to characterize survival differences among disaggregated Hispanic ethnic groups with the deadliest cancers in the US.<br \/>Methods: Breast, prostate, lung, liver, pancreas, colon, rectosigmoid, and rectal cancer cases among Non-Hispanic White (NHW), Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South\/Central American, Dominican or &#8220;Hispanic Not Otherwise Specified&#8221; were extracted from the National Cancer Database (2010-2015). Analysis was restricted to patients with only one primary cancer diagnosis and the most prevalent histologies. Restricted mean survival times were determined. Survival across groups was compared using Cox proportional hazard models. Multivariable analysis included socioeconomic, pathologic, comorbidity, and treatment factors.<br \/>Results: Across all cancers, Hispanic patients [54.7 months (95% CI: 54.0-55.4)] had significantly longer survival compared to NHW patients [50.5 months (95% CI: 50.5-51.0)], with Dominican patients having the longest survival [65.5 months (95% CI: 60.5-70.5)]. On univariable analysis, Dominican patients had lower risk of death across all cancers compared to NHW (HR 0.56, p&#60;0.0001). When similarly analyzed by individual cancer type, Dominican patients had the lowest risk of death among each cancer except lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). On multivariable analysis, hazard of death was even lower for Dominican patients (HR 0.48, p&#60;0.0001) compared to NHW patients across all cancer types. After adjusting for covariates, similar trends persisted for Dominican patients across all cancer types: breast (HR 0.46, p&#60;0.0001), prostate (HR 0.42, p&#60;0.0001), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (HR 0.49, p&#60;0.0001), hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 0.54, p&#60;0.0001), lung adenocarcinoma (HR 0.45, p&#60;0.0001), lung SCC (HR 0.67, p=0.008), colon (HR 0.62, p=0.0004), rectosigmoid (HR 0.39, p=0.023), and rectal adenocarcinomas (HR 0.46, p=0.005). Lung SCC was the only cancer that Dominican patients trailed another group in lowest hazard of death (Cuban patients&#8217; HR 0.64).<br \/>Conclusion: Patients of Dominican descent experience improved survival compared to NHW and other Hispanic ethnic groups across nearly all common cancer types, regardless of socioeconomic factors, cancer stage and pathology, and treatment. Genomic diversity and cultural factors may influence differential survival among Hispanic groups. It is critical to accurately record data on disaggregated Hispanic ethnicity and to promote inclusion of a diverse patients in cancer research. This may in turn elucidate differences in carcinogenesis and treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7fca5715-1167-4ab4-ac7f-744538d9907d\/@z03B8ZD1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hispanic,Mortality,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13460"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrea N.

We sought to characterize treatment patterns among older patients and identify factors for receipt of non-standard of care (SOC) treatment.<br \/>Methods: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried to describe treatment patterns in stage I-III colorectal cancer patients (2004-2017) over 65 years of age. Patients with metastatic disease and non-adenocarcinoma histology were excluded. SOC therapy was defined as any recommended treatment option listed within site- and stage-specific National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Clinicodemographic characteristics and treatment patterns were compared between colon and rectal cancer patients by ten-year age-groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with receipt of treatment, by tumor site and stage.<br \/>Results: Of the<b> <\/b>498,285 patients who met inclusion criteria, 47% were 65-75 years while 15% were &#62;85 years old (median age: 76 years). The majority were non-Hispanic White (88%), female (52%), Medicare insured (86%), colon cancer patients (76%) with a Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) of 0 (63%). Significant differences in treatment patterns by age were observed; for e.g., 11% of stage I colon cancer patients &#62;85 years of age did not receive SOC surgical treatment but rather received radiation-only treatment compared to only 2% patients 65-75 years of age who received radiation-only treatment. In logistic regression analyses adjusted for diagnosis year, sex, race\/ethnicity, CCI, insurance, income, education, hospital type, treatment facility, rurality, and geographic region, older patients were more likely to receive non-SOC treatments for colon cancer stage I [OR(95% CI) for 76-85 years 1.31(1.23,1.40); &#62;85 years 3.41(3.17,3.66)], stage II-III [OR(95% CI) for 76-85 years 1.96(1.92,2.01); &#62;85 years 3.50(3.40,3.60)], rectal cancer stage I [OR(95% CI) for 76-85 years 2.06(1.89,2.24); &#62;85 years 6.36(5.77,7.02)], and stage II-III [OR(95% CI) for 76-85 years 2.14(2.07,2.22); &#62;85 years 9.02(8.33,9.77)] compared to 65-75 year old patients. Other predictors of receiving non-SOC treatments for both colon and rectal cancers included Black race (p&#60;0.001), CCI &#62;3 (p&#60;0.001), lack of insurance (p&#60;0.001), and treatment at a community cancer clinic (p&#60;0.001).<br \/>Discussion: Compared to 65-75 year-old stage I-III colorectal cancer patients, older patients at all disease stages are more likely to not receive SOC treatment. Other predictors for receiving non-SOC treatment are Black race, presence of comorbidities, lack of insurance, and treatment at a community cancer clinic. Future observational and randomized studies are needed to define the optimal treatment paradigms in older colorectal cancer patients, identify and address disparities, and better support these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10c7dc00-0233-4c64-992b-6c7298816f4d\/@z03B8ZD1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Epidemiology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13456"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sheetal Hardikar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher R.

Our purpose was to evaluate population-based adherence to mammographic screening using criteria from major guideline-producing organizations across race\/ethnicity to understand what social determinants of mammography adherence are associated with each guideline producing institution.<br \/>Methods: Women aged 45-79 in the 2016 California Health Interview Survey were included. Self-reported mammographic screening within 1 or 2 years, according to major guideline-producing organizations (American Cancer Society [ACS], US Preventative Services Task Force [USPSTF], American College of Radiology [ACR], American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG]) was calculated with logistic regression, adjusting for demographics, health care, insurance status, and BMI.<br \/>Results: 7,551 women were included in this study. By age category, cross-sectional adherence to ACR\/ACOG (annual screening) (65 to 67%) and USPSTF guidelines (biennial screening) ranged from 82-83% and with increasing age being generally associated higher adherence. The highest proportions of women undergoing mammographic screening were seen in women ages 60-69 (67% within last year, 85% within last 2 years). Statistically significant predictors of adherence to mammography screening included Latina race (OR 1.62, 0.18 SE), full time employment (OR 0.73, 0.09 SE), and not having a usual healthcare provider (OR 0.50, 0.12 SE), adjusted for demographics, health care, insurance status, and BMI.<br \/>Conclusion: Frequency of screening increases with age with highest screening proportions in women ages 65-69 (66% within last year, 81% within last 2 years). For ACR\/ACOG screening guidelines, adherence to mammography screening remains poorer in women with no usual source of care, given that their odds of exhibiting adherence was half that of women who did have a regular source of care and nearly 65 percent lower odds of those women with USPSTF mammography adherence.<br \/>Key Words: Breast cancer, screening, race\/ethnicity, guideline-based care","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2c034141-d3ee-4156-8fa1-fd7ff12ef9e4\/@z03B8ZD1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-21 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Breast cancer,Screening,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13585"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Roman Johnson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mieke Beth Thomeer<\/i><\/presenter>.

Several dietary and lifestyle factors may influence the risk of developing lethal prostate cancer. This study evaluated to what extent differences in the prevalence of modifiable risk factors by race could explain racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality.<br \/>Methods: Our study utilized data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, N=51,529 men, 1986-2016) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES, 2000-2010). First, we used data from NHANES to estimate the prevalence of three factors among Black and White men: smoking, vitamin D, and coffee. Then, using HPFS, we generated relative risk estimates for lethal prostate cancer for each factor. To estimate the relative prostate cancer burden associated with these risk factors, we calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) for each factor by self-identified race, defined as the reduction in mortality that would be achieved if the population had been entirely unexposed, compared with the current exposure pattern. We then calculated the difference in the PAF between Black and white men to estimate the difference in mortality reduction between the two groups if all men had been entirely unexposed, assuming causality of risk factors and no effect modification by race.<br \/>Results: There were notable differences in the prevalence of several risk factors by race. For example, Black men had significantly lower levels of vitamin D[MLA1] , were less likely to drink coffee, and had a higher prevalence of smoking compared to white men. We estimated that eliminating these risk factors among Black men could lead to a reduction in prostate cancer mortality that is 4-14% larger compared to eliminating these risk factors among white men.<br \/>Conclusions: Modifiable lifestyle and dietary factors are potentially responsible for a proportion of the racial disparity in prostate cancer mortality. Our future work will expand the modifiable factors as well as incorporating more contemporary comparisons of the prevalence of these factors to predict future disparities in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/69c76e90-4706-4fc2-b5d4-135356544446\/@z03B8ZD1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Mortality,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20479"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Emily Rencsok<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Michelle Sodipo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Travis Gerke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Konrad Stopsack<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorelei Mucci<\/i><\/presenter>.
