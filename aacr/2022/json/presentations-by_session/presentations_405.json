[{"Abstract":"KIT is a well characterized oncogenic driver, mutated in up to 80% of gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Front-line imatinib is effective in many patients but durable responses in the setting of imatinib failure are rarely achieved due to complex secondary mutations that arise in the KIT ATP-binding pocket (exons 13\/14) or the activation (A)loop (exons 17\/18). Second-line sunitinib is active against exon 13\/14 mutations but not A-loop mutations and identifying inhibitors that target the spectrum of possible mutations without incurring off-target toxicities related to broad-spectrum kinase inhibition has been challenging. Bezuclastinib (CGT9486) is a novel type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor that was designed as a potent and selective inhibitor of KIT A-loop mutations to address this unmet medical need. Herein, we present nonclinical data on the differentiated selectivity profile of bezuclastinib compared with other KIT inhibitors. We show that bezuclastinib is a low nanomolar inhibitor of KIT A-loop mutants which uniquely avoids targeting closely related kinases with known liabilities (e.g., PDGFRA, PDGFRB, CSF1R, and KDR) versus other approved inhibitors. In vivo pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) relationships have been evaluated utilizing either HMC1.2 human mast cell leukemia tumors for KIT phosphorylation or a Ba\/F3-KIT-D816V splenomegaly model. In these models, plasma exposure associated with 50% reduction in splenomegaly or KIT phosphorylation was observed at 3-10 mg\/kg\/day corresponding to exposures 1.5-2.2 &#181;g&#8729;hr\/mL. This correlated well with plasma exposure required to cause significant tumor growth inhibition in a GIST patient-derived xenograft model harboring an A-loop mutation (~1.3 &#181;g&#8729;hr\/mL). Maximal efficacy in the PKPD models and tumor regression in GIST disease models was observed in exposure ranges of 19-36 or 11-44 &#181;g&#8729;hr\/mL, respectively, which corresponds to clinically reached exposures in a recent GIST combination study of bezuclastinib with sunitinib. Importantly, in nonclinical studies, we also show that bezuclastinib has minimal brain penetration, a preferred feature of an anti-KIT molecule due to CNS-related adverse events observed in this targeted class. We present a tissue distribution study which demonstrates a brain:plasma ratio &#60;0.1 following a 3-day administration at a dose that correlates with clinical exposure. This attractive selectivity and nonclinical safety profile, combined with early clinical data in advanced solid tumors, supports the potential for a best-in-class KIT inhibitor. Bezuclastinib is currently under clinical investigation in advanced SM (Phase 2, Apex NCT04996875), non-advanced SM (Phase 2, Summit), and imatinib-resistant GIST (Phase 3, Peak).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a0da8de4-4173-40ae-b809-291823dd1ac5\/@C03B8ZHH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kit tyrosine kinase,Kinase inhibitors,Blood-brain barrier,Gastrointestinal stromal tumor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13106"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Guarnieri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karyn Bouhana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>LouAnn Cable<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rob Rieger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leyla Haygood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Robinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shannon Winski<\/i><\/presenter>.

The full activation of Raf requires the dimerization of the kinase domain. The dimer interface of Raf has been regarded as an important therapeutic target against cancer. The next generation paradox breakers target the Raf dimerization. Despite the clinical importance, it remains unclear that how the <i>transverse side-to-side<\/i> dimerization promotes the OFF-to-ON transition of Raf&#8217;s kinase domain, and how the activated ON-state kinase domain can be stabilized in the dimer for Raf signaling. In this work, we uncover an atomic-level mechanism of Raf activation through dimerization, addressing these questions. The mechanism shows that the replacement of the intramolecular &#960;-&#960; stacking by the intermolecular &#960;-&#960; stacking at the dimer interface promotes the Raf activation. It releases the structural constraint of the &#945;C-helix, inducing a series of conformational changes for the OFF-to-ON transition, such as the disruption of the inhibitory hydrophobic interactions and the approach of phosphorylation sites in A-loop to HRD motif for cis-autophosphorylation. Once activated, the ON-state kinase domain can be stabilized by the N-terminal basic (NtB) motif in the dimer for Raf signaling. This work provides the high-resolution structural insights into the Raf activation, suggesting a new structural strategy for drug discovery against Raf dimerization.

Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which do not have upregulation of any of these receptors, lack directed therapies and therefore, are associated with a worse prognosis. The lack of directed therapies for TNBC and high incidence of relapse and drug resistance found in all breast cancers underscores the need for identification of additional therapeutic targets. The analysis of gene expression data revealed that PIM1 and PIM2 kinases are upregulated in triple negative breast cancer. PIM kinases are a family of serine\/threonine kinases that activate cell division, promote cell growth, and inhibit apoptosis. Due to PIM1\/2&#8217;s effect on these cellular processes and PIM1\/2 being upregulated in TNBC, we hypothesized that PIM1\/2 play an important role in progression of triple negative breast cancer. Knockdown of PIM1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells, including MDA-231, BT-20, HCC-1806, and MDA-468 cells. To study the <i>in vivo<\/i> roles of PIM1\/2 in breast cancer progression and metastasis, we crossed the highly metastatic MMTV-PyMT breast cancer mouse model with PIM1\/2 knockout mice. Deletion of PIM1 or PIM2 alone significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced lung metastasis in these mice. Dual deletion of PIM1 and PIM2 significantly reduced tumor growth and almost completely blocked lung metastasis in these mice. A major advantage of the MMTV-PyMT model over xenograft models is that the immune system is intact in these mice, and that enabled us to perform immune cell profiling on the tumors. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) have been shown to promote tumor metastasis and are a poor prognostic marker for TNBC. Deletion of PIM1 alone and combined PIM1 and PIM2 deletion resulted in a significant reduction in the number of TAMs, indicating PIM1\/2 play a significant role in regulating the immune milieu of these tumors. To understand the underlying mechanism by which PIM1 and PIM2 contribute to these processes, we performed biochemical analysis. Western blot analysis of PIM1 knockdown in MDA-231 cells showed a decrease in phosphorylation of CXCR4, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4EBP1 and increased expression of cell cycle regulator p27. Additionally, we performed RNA-seq analysis to identify which pathways were affected by PIM1\/2 deletion in MMTV-PyMT tumors. GSEA analysis showed a significant enrichment of genes related to inflammatory response, extracellular matrix, EMT and metastasis in PyMT tumors and those were significantly reduced in PIM1\/2 double knockout tumors. These results suggest that PIM1 and PIM2 play a significant role in the progression and metastasis of triple negative breast cancer and indicate that PIM1\/2 inhibition could be a useful therapeutic approach for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4e043d26-4ed4-4608-9902-326dbfa2fdf3\/@C03B8ZHH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Kinases,Mouse models,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13108"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patrick Faughnan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Golam Mohi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chandrajeet Singh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Poor prognosis of GB has limitations in current therapeutics mainly due to the development of resistance. Our results demonstrated that atypical protein kinase C-iota and zeta (aPKC-&#953;\/&#950;) levels were over-expressed in GB cells (U-87 and T-98) and tissue samples compared to normal brain cells\/tissues which is correlated with increased invasiveness. The present study shows the downstream effects of <i>si<\/i>RNA knockdown of PKC-&#953; \/&#950; on the expression of aPKCs, E-cadherin, Vimentin, p-Vimentin, 14-3-3 and p-14-3-3, BAD, p-BAD, Pdk1, Akt1, c-Raf, Tak1, Smad2\/3 and p-Smad2\/3. Downregulation of Vimentin, p-Vimentin (S33 and S56) and increased E-cadherin indicated the downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Proteolytic E-cadherin fragment of 80 kDa indicates the reduction of cancer progression. Result also indicated that SNAIL1, SLUG and PRRX1 transcriptional activities were downregulated as a result of aPKC diminution. These transcription factors are known to induce and promote EMT. 14-3-3 is known to bind Pdk1, BAD, Akt1 and c-Raf and perform various anti-apoptotic tasks. Our results indicated that total 14-3-3 levels were significantly increased as a result of aPKC attenuation along with dephosphorylated BAD. In addition, p-14-3-3, p-BAD, pAkt1, Pdk1 levels were significantly decreased. Unphosphorylated 14-3-3 does not bind with their partners: phosphorylation on conserved S259 and S621 through Tak1 which is essential for its activation. Our results indicated that Tak1 levels significantly decreased as a result of aPKC diminution. <i>In-vitro<\/i> migration\/ invasion assays, immunoprecipitation (IP), immunofluorescence and immuno-gold transmission electron microscopic techniques, real time qPCR and Western blot techniques are being used in this study to further analyze role of aPKCs in GB malignancy. Our IP and kinase activity assay data confirmed that PKC-&#953; heavily interacts with Pdk1 and PKC-&#950; interacts with Akt1, thereby activating those two kinases via phosphorylation. Data confirmed that aPKC attenuation triggers multiple pro apoptotic signaling cascades through downregulation of Akt1, Pdk1, 14-3-3 and Smad2\/3.We have used a novel PKC-&#953; specific inhibitor 5-amino-1-(2,3-dihydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (ICA-1S) and a PKC-&#950; specific inhibitor 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-naphthalenetrisulfonic acid (&#950;-Stat) to conduct <i>in-vivo<\/i> experiments on murine models. Excised tumors will be analyzed for pathways observed in <i>in-vitro<\/i> experiments. Overall results suggest that aPKCs are crucial for increased invasiveness in GB. Results suggested that aPKC can be targeted to develop customized, tailored therapies for Glioblastoma which merit further research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8fda01af-476b-4e67-b532-8bb53a1d90ec\/@C03B8ZHH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein kinase C isoforms,Glioblastoma,14-3-3,Smad,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13109"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wishrawana Sarathi Ratnayake<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khandker M.

Therefore, there is a need to identify novel molecular targets that could be exploited to overcome TNBC chemoresistance. Mixed-lineage kinase 4 (MLK4) is a member of MLK family of serine\/threonine kinases. Large-scale genomic and transcriptomic data indicated that MLK4 gene (<i>MAP3K21\/KIAA1804<\/i>) is amplified and overexpressed in approximately 50% of triple-negative tumors. We have recently demonstrated that MLK4 promotes the aggressive growth and metastatic potential of TNBC cells. However, the functional role of MLK4 in resistance to chemotherapy has not been investigated so far. In our recent study, we have shown that MLK4 contributes to TNBC chemoresistance by regulating the pro-survival response to DNA-damaging therapies. MLK4 knock-down or inhibition sensitized TNBC cell lines to doxorubicin and etoposide <i>in vitro.<\/i><i> <\/i>Moreover, loss of MLK4 enhanced sensitivity of HCC1806 TNBC cell line towards doxorubicin in a xenograft mouse model. Our data indicated that MLK4 silencing induced persistent DNA damage accumulation and enhanced apoptosis in TNBC cells treated with chemotherapeutics. To further determine cellular mechanisms responsible for the identified MLK4-dependent chemoresistance in TNBC, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of control and MLK4-depleted HCC1806 cells, either untreated or treated with doxorubicin. We found that the doxorubicin-induced phosphorylation of several core DNA damage response components, including ATM, TRIM28 (KAP-1), MDC1 and TP53BP1, was impaired in cells with MLK4 knock-down. These findings were further confirmed using HCC1806 cells with CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated deletion of MLK4, which showed markedly reduced phosphorylation of ATM kinase at Ser1981 - a site critical for ATM monomerization and activation. ATM was shown to activate NF-&#954;B transcription in response to DNA damage through the well-established nuclear to cytoplasmic signaling pathway involving NEMO. Interestingly, we observed diminished phosphorylation of NEMO and reduced expression of several NF-&#1082;B-associated pro-survival cytokines (<i>IL6, IL8, CXCL1, CXCL6<\/i>) in MLK4-depleted TNBC cells treated with doxorubicin. These data, along with the additional immunoprecipitation and kinase assay experiments, indicate that MLK4 is involved in the regulation of DNA damage response signaling and ATM-NEMO pathway activation. Moreover, our recent results suggest that MLK4 controls autocrine\/paracrine signaling loops in cancer cells and tumor microenvironment (TME) upon treatment with chemotherapy. We currently aim to further determine how MLK4-dependent crosstalk between TNBC cells and TME contributes to chemoresistance and tumor progression.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3d02773a-762e-4c28-a626-f637d671c7ef\/@C03B8ZHH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Chemoresistance,Breast cancer,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13110"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dawid Mehlich<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michal Lomiak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Sobiborowicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alicja Mazan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dagmara Dymerska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukasz M.

Disruption of its homeostasis can result in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a kinase that plays a central role in multiple signaling pathways, including cellular proliferation, where it inhibits the activity of its substrates. GSK3 dynamics can be described as a multiple input multiple output system. Numerous upstream growth factors can regulate and thus inhibit GSK3 from acting on its many substrates. Mutations in these growth signaling pathways (e.g., Wnt and KRAS) have been well established to have a role in CRC progression. Therefore, aberrantly activated signaling due to these proteins are presumed to result in the constitutive inhibition of GSK3 activity in CRC, thus making it an ideal therapeutic target. The aim of this study is to discover an allosteric GSK3 small molecule activator that can restore GSK3 kinase activity within CRC. Method: We screened 50,000 small molecule compounds using a luciferase-based in-vitro kinase assay. We are further confirming our top hits using both chemical and cell-based assays. For the cell-based assays, we test the compounds in human colonic epithelial cells (HCEC) and its three isogenic cell lines, which mimic CRC progression, and monitor changes in GSK3 kinase activity indirectly, via changes in its substrate protein levels, and directly via a live-cell GSK3 specific reporter. In addition, the top hits are also tested in both normal colon and CRC organoids. Results: Prior to running our large screen, we performed various optimization steps to determine the ideal condition for our screening assay. Our screening assay scored a Z-Score of 0.5 and higher, which indicated that it was a high-quality screening assay. Additionally, we have developed two cell-based orthogonal HTS assays. One using immunofluorescence and single-cell quantification of 24 GSK3 substrates from various pathways in our cell lines. Second, we engineered a GSK3 live-cell reporter and expressed it in the HCEC cells and three isogenic cell lines and organoid models. Impact: There is a need for advancements in preventative or therapeutic targets against CRC. Research indicates that suppression of GSK3 enzymatic activity decreases sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic and targeted therapies. Therefore, restoring GSK3 enzymatic activity in CRC may re-sensitize tumors to other targeted therapies and establish GSK3 as a potential therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7c598874-0db2-47c5-a5d1-12e606fbac50\/@C03B8ZHH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Screening,High-throughput assay,Colon cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13111"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Reeba P.

The discovery of most of the currently known driver mutations has been facilitated by their accumulation in mutation hotspots within their respective genes. However, a vast majority of mutations in cancer tissues are rare and their functional significance remains unknown. Several lines of in vitro and clinical evidence also indicate that there is a significant number of, as yet unidentified, activating driver mutations which could serve as predictive markers in oncology. Here, we performed an unbiased functional screen to identify potential activating mutations of ERBB4, a frequently mutated member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family.<br \/>Method: To identify functional driver mutations of ERBB4, the previously published pipeline, in vitro screen for activating mutations (iSCREAM) [1], was utilized. iSCREAM is a functional genetics screen based on the expression of random cDNA variants and the ability of driver mutations to promote cellular growth in vitro. The expression library encoding randomly mutated ERBB4 variants was retrovirally introduced into murine lymphoid Ba\/F3 cells, that normally require interleukin-3 (IL-3) for survival but can exploit ectopic expression of activated variants of oncogenic kinases to compensate for the deficiency of exogenous IL-3. When expressed under an appropriate promoter, the wild-type ERBB4 receptor failed to promote IL-3-independent survival in the presence of the neuregulin-1 ligand, while the cells expressing activating mutations readily proliferated. The identity and frequency of the activating ERBB4 mutations were subsequently determined from the proliferating cell pool using targeted next-generation sequencing.<br \/>Results: Ten candidate activating mutations were identified out of the over 7000 random ERBB4 missense or nonsense mutations present in the original library. The candidate activating mutations were individually characterized using functional assays both in vitro and in vivo, as well as by structural analyses. The activating mutation were sensitive to clinically used pan-ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors afatinib, dacomitinib and neratinib.<br \/>Conclusions: A subset of ERBB4 missense mutations are activating and sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0bc8ed0-63d8-45e3-853e-119dc3f33a8a\/@D03B8ZHJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),High-throughput assay,Activating Mutations,Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-4 (ERBB4),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13112"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Deepankar Chakroborty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Veera K.

The poor efficacy of PI3K\/AKT inhibitors in PC likely relate to multiple PI3K and AKT isoforms which have compensatory or even oppositional roles. Whereas PI3K-p110 isoform-specific inhibitors are being used in clinical trials, no clinical AKT isoform-specific inhibitors exist. Data from our lab and others indicate that progression to aggressive mPC is dependent on AKT2-, and possibly AKT3-specific pathways. However, previous screens could not distinguish between direct vs. indirect AKT isoform-preferred substrates, and they only focused on substrates with canonical phosphorylation motifs (RxRxxS*\/T*). We addressed this gap using a novel phosphoproteomics analysis that identifies direct AKT isoform substrates from PC lysates in which substrates are in endogenous protein-protein complexes. Scores of novel and previously known substrates were identified that are preferred by individual or combinations of AKT isoforms, conforming to both the canonical and four novel non-canonical motifs; &#62;95% of these sites exist in phosphoproteome databases. By comparing data from PC cell lines isogenic for PTEN loss or expression, we identified PTEN-influenced substrate phosphorylation or AKT isoform preference. However, most of these cases did not correlate with changes in substrate abundance, suggesting novel roles for PTEN in regulating substrate modifications or cellular compartmentalization. We hypothesize that AKT2 and AKT3 substrate phosphorylation drives parameters of <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>mPC progression, suggesting that these AKT isoforms may be therapeutic targets if specific inhibitors can be produced. Data will be shown i) confirming AKT isoform preference of specific substrates, ii) identifying novel mechanisms by which PTEN influences substrate usage or isoform preference via altering cellular compartmentalization or post-translational modification, and iii) validating our identified non-canonical AKT isoform-specific phosphorylation sites. We also show that the phosphorylation of AKT2\/3-preferred substrates drives metastatic progression <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo. <\/i> Our data identify a much broader array of AKT isoform-specific, -preferred and -shared substrates, including those encoding previously unidentified non-canonical phosphorylation motifs. We also show novel function for PTEN, namely, to influence AKT isoform substrate usage and preference.

Defects in endosomal sorting are implicated in various human pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The small GTPase Ras-related protein Rab-7a (Rab7a) serves as a key organizer of the endosomal-lysosomal system. However, molecular mechanisms controlling Rab7a activation levels and subcellular translocation are still poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase i5 (PIPKIgammai5), an endosome-localized enzyme that produces phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2<\/sub>), directly interacts with Rab7a and plays critical roles in the control of endosomal-lysosomal system. The loss of PIPKIgammai5 blocks Rab7a recruitment to early endosomes, which prevents the maturation of early to late endosomes. In this way, PIPKIgammai5 is required for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) sorting from endosomes to lysosomes, which controls the down-regulation of EGFR signaling. Furthermore, PIPKIgammai5 loss disturbs retromer complex connection with Rab7a, which blocks the retrograde sorting of Cation-independent Mannose 6-Phosphate Receptor (CI-MPR) from late endosomes. This leads to the decreased sorting of hydrolases to lysosomes. Thus, loss of PIPKIgammai5 causes lysosome dysfunction and reduces the autophagic degradation. By modulating retromer-Rab7a connection, PIPKIgammai5 is also required for the recruitment of the GTPase&#8208;activating protein (GAP) TBC1 domain family member 5 (TBC1D5) to late endosomes, which controls the conversion of Rab7a from the active state to the inactive state. Altogether, PIPKIgammai5 is critical for the modulation of Rab7a activity, localization, and function in the endosomal-lysosomal system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4026f7ec-538e-4f93-ba8f-910d9866cb8a\/@D03B8ZHJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"GTPase,EGFR,Kinases,Lysosome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13114"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ming Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gary Luong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faiz Plastikwala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yue Sun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway has been extensively investigated as a therapeutic target due to its mechanistic association with several hallmarks of cancer. Studying dynamic changes in kinase activity can be difficult, and assays to measure these changes in live cells in a physiologically relevant environment are lacking. Standard approaches to monitoring Akt kinase activity are limited to end point assays which lack the ability to monitor the effects of treatments over time. Here we demonstrate the utility of the Incucyte&#174; Kinase Akt Lentivirus Reagent, encoding a kinase translocation reporter based on a green fluorescent protein-tagged Akt substrate whose subcellular localization is phosphorylation-dependent, and a red fluorescent nuclear protein to denote the nuclear\/cytoplasmic boundary. To demonstrate inhibition of Akt, A549 cells stably expressing the reporter were treated with compounds targeting the PI3K\/Akt kinase pathway, including allosteric Akt inhibitors MK2206 and API-1, competitive Akt inhibitors AZD5363 and Ipatasertib, and upstream PI3K kinase inhibitors LY294002 and PI-103. Quantification of treatment responses using the Incucyte&#174; Live Cell Analysis System showed concentration-dependent inhibition of Akt activity for all compounds with varying kinetic profiles over 24 hours. To study activation of Akt, HeLa cells were first cultured in the absence of serum to reduce Akt activity. After 4 hours of incubation in serum-free conditions, the cells were treated with either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or recombinant insulin-like growth factor (R3-IGF-1) to activate Akt. An increase in Akt activity was observed for both treatments. While R3-IGF-1-induced activation was sustained over the 12-hour time course, activation by EGF diminished over time. Cell lines with mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN showed no response to serum starvation or activation with EGF or R3-IGF-1. In addition to monitoring Akt activity over time, the integrated red nuclear restricted protein of the reporter enables concurrent measurements of proliferation. The selective Akt inhibitor MK2206 decreased Akt activity in a similar concentration-dependent manner in both T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. In contrast, measurements of red object count from the same cells reveal differential effects of MK2206 on proliferation between the two cell lines, with concentration-dependent inhibition of T-47D cell growth but little effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall, these data highlight the utility of the Incucyte&#174; Kinase Akt Lentivirus Reagent to provide valuable kinetic measurements of Akt activity using live cells within a physiologically relevant environment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ee7580c-5c8f-4515-bd7b-1974536c3184\/@D03B8ZHJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Akt,PI3K,Image analysis,PTEN,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13115"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John N.

The highly malignant profile is mainly caused by the constitutive activation of mutant KRAS - found in approximately 90% of PDAC cases. The undruggability of genetic KRAS mutations has led to efforts to find new therapeutical targets that focus on downstream molecules in this pathway. DUSP6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase that regulates ERK1\/2 phosphorylation and, therefore, downstream RAS pathway activation. DUSP6 has been demonstrated to be differentially expressed during PDAC tumorigenesis, which we believe is critical for tumor progression and metastasis. <i>In silico <\/i>analysis on the TCGA dataset revealed that <i>DUSP6<\/i> is overexpressed in primary tumor samples compared to normal pancreatic tissue. This data was confirmed in an independent dataset (GSE71729) that further revealed <i>DUSP6<\/i> overexpression in metastatic samples compared to primary tumor samples. Additionally, patients with higher <i>DUSP6 <\/i>expression have worse overall survival than patients with low <i>DUSP6<\/i> expression (<i>P<\/i> = 0.039), reaffirming its clinical relevance. We then assessed <i>DUSP6<\/i> expression in tumor sections derived from KC and KPC mice using the RNAscope technology and observed that <i>DUSP6<\/i> was strongly overexpressed in tumorigenic lesions, and largely co-localized with <i>KRT19<\/i> expression. Using BCI - a pharmacological DUSP6 inhibitor - we observed significantly reduced viability <i>in vitro<\/i> in all the cell lines (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.0001). DUSP6 inhibition also promoted ERK1\/2 activation, as expected. Surprisingly, we observed that BCI-mediated DUSP6 inhibition increased migratory capacity in AsPC-1 (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.0001), but not on BxPC-3 cells. Furthermore, murine AKC cells presented the completely opposite phenotype, with a significant decrease in migratory capacity (P &#60; 0.0001), indicating a possible context dependent response. To further understand the molecular mechanisms behind DUSP6 in PDAC, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis using the TCGA and GSE15471 datasets and observed a strong correlation between DUSP6 and the glycolysis pathway. Therefore, we knocked down DUSP6 in K8484 cells and evaluated their proliferation in response to 2-DG, which was significantly decreased in comparison to treated parental cells (P &#60; 0.001). In accordance with that, DUSP6 knockdown cells were significantly more impacted by 2-DG treatment than the parental cells regarding migratory capacity, bringing it to the basal level. Collectively, these results suggest that DUSP6 appears to modulate the metastatic process, and this phenotype correlates with the altered glycolytic capacity of pancreatic cancer cells. We are currently expanding our studies to additional cell lines and using <i>in vivo<\/i> models to further investigate if the observed phenotype is context dependent. To assess glycolytic changes in the cells, we are currently performing Seahorse-based assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6aeeca2b-07ee-460e-b9d9-471b71f9d2d5\/@D03B8ZHJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phosphorylation,Metastasis,Glycolysis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13116"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mariana T.

Choice of treatments recommended for clear cell carcinoma and non-clear cell carcinoma are partial nephrectomy (Stage I), radical nephrectomy (Stage II and III) and chemotherapy (stage IV). Phosphatidylinositol-3- kinase (PI3K) inhibitors can be a viable candidate in the chemotherapy of ccRCC as the PI3K\/PDK1 pathway is frequently activated in RCC. Hence, PI3K inhibitors like Alpelisib (BYL 719) can be a choice of treatment. In addition, aPKCs, PKC &#943;\/&#955; and PKC &#950; are overexpressed in most cancer cells and play a central role in tumor progression and metastasis of different type of cancers. Treatment of ccRCC metastatic clear cells with a combination of aPKC inhibitor [8-hydroxynaphthalene-1, 3, 6-trisulfonic acid] &#950;-stat, or ICA-1 and BYL 719 inhibits PKC &#943;\/&#955; and PKC &#950; with the downstream inhibition of c-Myc (a major protein controlling cell survival and cell cycle progression in RCC). Inhibition of the aPKCs (PKC &#943;\/&#955; and PKC &#950;) also reduces the activation of other important proteins, for example, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1\/2). It is observed that treatment with &#950;-stat, or ICA-1 disrupts the aPKC-AKT1 association which in turns reduces the activation of AKT1 through phosphorylation. &#950;-stat, or ICA-1 treatment also disrupts association between aPKC and c-Myc. Inhibition of aPKCs and other downstream effector proteins by combination therapy is more pronounced compared to the single therapy. These effects contribute to reduced cell growth, cell survival and eventually induction of apoptosis. Boyden Chamber assay also suggested that there is decreased invasiveness of the cells when treated with the combination treatment. This can be due to the inactivation of both ERK1\/2 and AKT by the combination treatment. In addition, efflux proteins, (p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), responsible for developing cell resistance, had reduced expression<br \/>in the cells when treated with &#950;-stat as a single therapy along with the combination of Alpelisib and &#950;-stat. Hence, combination therapy of Alpelisib and an aPKC inhibitor for metastatic ccRCC can reduce expression of multi drug resistance (MDR) proteins\/efflux transporter P-gp and ABCG2. Therefore, a combination of Alpelisib and an aPKC inhibitor is an effective approach to reducing cell proliferation, invasion and resistance eventually inducing apoptosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/80e3e4b6-485f-448d-aa91-10d2a2c521bf\/@D03B8ZHJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,PI3K,Protein kinase C,ABCG2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13117"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Khandker Mohammad Khalid<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wishrawana S.

To ensure higher treatment success, it is critical to identify unique biomarkers to mitigate &#8220;off-target&#8221; effects. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers and appropriate target selection has never been more important to improve cancer immunotherapy. The DNA salvage pathway protein thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) plays an important role in DNA synthesis and repair. Normally, it is highly expressed during S phase and provides recycled nucleotides by phosphorylating thymidine to make thymidine monophosphate. Past studies have suggested that TK1 may influence cell cycle control and, therefore, provides a platform for the understanding of disease progression and possible means of mitigation.<br \/>The purpose of our study was to verify elevated TK1 levels in breast cancer cells and further investigate TK1&#8217;s potential influence over cell cycle control. We hypothesized that TK1 may be important in regulating the cell cycle and other cell checkpoint proteins. Immunohistochemistry analysis was employed to quantify TK1 expression in ductal and lobular primary and matched metastatic breast cancer samples compared to normal tissue. Bioinformatics was then used to analyze RNA-seq data of cell cycle checkpoint factors and TK1 in BRCA patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas. To demonstrate TK1&#8217;s potential effect on the cell cycle checkpoint pathway, we utilized HCC1806 breast cancer cells and generated a CRISPR-Cas9 TK1 knockdown (L133) cell line for in vitro testing. These were validated by western blotting and qPCR. Propidium iodide staining and cell cycle analysis were performed via flow cytometry on both cell lines. Immunohistochemistry results indicated that TK1 levels increase as breast cancer progresses and, thus, may correlate with breast cancer aggressiveness. Bioinformatics analysis showed that strong positive correlations exist between cell cycle checkpoint factors and TK1 in BRCA patients, such as BRCA1 and CHEK2. Flow cytometry cell cycle analysis showed that mean differences of L133 cells in S phase were significantly higher than in G1 compared to HCC 1806 cells, suggesting that TK1 levels influence cell cycle arrest.<br \/>Our preliminary results suggest that TK1 may affect cell cycle checkpoint pathways, which are essential to maintaining homeostasis in normal cells and preventing cancer progression. Further investigation to understand TK1&#8217;s potential interactions with important checkpoint factors, such as p53 or Gas6, may help elucidate other therapeutic targets for preventing disease progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae207457-131e-4d93-81c5-c4bbf0a4d353\/@D03B8ZHJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tyrosine kinase,Breast cancer,Cell cycle regulation,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13118"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Eliza E.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnoses, most of which present as advanced disease with poor prognoses. Despite existing treatment options, the overall 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients is about 17%. Many patients are diagnosed with advanced stage disease that frequently progresses after developing resistance to therapy. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control NSCLC progression is necessary to develop new therapies to improve the prognoses of patients. We recently demonstrated that dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32000 (DARPP-32), and its truncated splice variant, t-DARPP, promote NSCLC growth using functional studies, orthotopic mouse models, and patient-derived specimens. Specifically, we previously reported that DARPP-32 isoforms promote NSCLC cell migration through activation of non-canonical NF-&#954;B2 signaling by establishing a direct physical interaction with inhibitory kappa B kinase-alpha (IKK&#945;). Therefore, we first sought to determine whether IKK&#945; directly phosphorylates DARPP-32. Indeed, we observed that kinase active IKK&#945; protein phosphorylates DARPP-32 protein at the Thr-34 position using in vitro<\/i> kinase assays. Given that phosphorylated DARPP-32 acts as a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), we assessed PP1 activity upon transient overexpression of IKK&#945; in DARPP-32-overexpressed NSCLC cells. Our findings suggest phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by IKK&#945; results in decreased PP1-mediated phosphatase activity. This DARPP-32-mediated inhibition of PP1 was not observed in NSCLC cells stably overexpressing a form of DARPP-32 that cannot phosphorylated at the Thr-34 residue (via T34A mutation), suggesting IKK&#945; protein phosphorylates DARPP-32 at the Thr-34 position to stimulate DARPP-32-mediated inhibition of PP1 activity. Correspondingly, we have observed increased phosphorylation of ERK protein, a kinase regulated by PP1, upon pharmacological inhibition of PP1 as well as following overexpression of IKK&#945; protein. Ablation of IKK&#945; via lentiviral transduction reduces NSCLC cell growth in soft-agar colony formation assays. Furthermore, using an orthotopic human NSCLC cell line-derived xenograft mouse model, we have shown that depletion of IKK&#945; reduces tumor growth. Taken together, our findings suggest that IKK&#945; contributes to NSCLC growth by interacting with DARPP-32 to stimulate oncogenic kinase activity through the inhibition of PP1 phosphatase activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed4c5c54-e429-4760-85fa-5c6378ee305e\/@D03B8ZHJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IKK &#945;,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Protein phosphatase,Tumor biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13119"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sk.

To prevent this fate, cancer cells cluster their centrosomes at two poles during division to divide in a pseudobipolar manner. As the presence of supernumerary centrosomes is rare in normal cells, targeting the declustering of supernumerary centrosomes in cancer cells is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an oncogenic protein and chemotherapeutic target shown to be found at the centrosome where it has a role in facilitating centrosome clustering. Inhibition of ILK, via an anti-ILK chemotherapeutic drug QLT-0267, has been shown to increase centrosome declustering causing mitotic arrest and cell death. However, not all cancers cells are susceptible to anti-ILK treatment alone. Therefore, we investigate a combination treatment strategy targeting ILK and another oncogenic kinase, Abelson kinase (Abl). Both ILK and Abl are involved in cancer cell survival, regulated by the same signalling pathways and share common binding partners that occur at the centrosome and are critical for mitosis. The ILK inhibitor QLT-0267 induced a significant sub-G1 peak following propidium iodide FACS analysis and an increase in MTT labelling, indicating that QLT-0267 significantly decreased survival in glioblastoma cell lines. These effects were augmented in the presence of imatinib, an Abl inhibitor. Moreover, QLT-0267 and imatinib, in combination, significantly increased mitotically arrested cells over the ILK inhibitor alone. Increased levels of cytosolic Abl have been associated with its transformative abilities. The ILK inhibitor effects on survival correlated with its ability to decrease cytosolic Abl levels and inhibited Abl&#8217;s localization to mitotic centrosomes in dividing glioblastoma cells. These effects were reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (a drug that inhibits the degradation of Abl). Together these results indicate that combination treatment with QLT-0267 and imatinib are more effective then QLT-0267 alone at decreasing successful mitoses and survival in glioblastoma cells. Future studies will unravel the relationship between these oncogenic kinases at centrosomes and its effect on cancer cell cycle progression and survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ab4540c-cd00-4b40-b4cd-048bb3b39f6a\/@D03B8ZHJ\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imatinib,Glioblastoma,Cancer therapy,Centrosome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13120"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jonathan Dresselhuis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maddisen Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Robinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqueline Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael E.

The reprogrammed metabolism supports the acquisition of malignant traits, increasing cellular fitness and providing a selective advantage in tumorigenesis. Multiple signaling cascades converge to regulate cancer cell metabolism to maintain a delicate balance between anabolic and catabolic processes, with the overall goal to fuel ATP production, biosynthesis of macromolecules and maintaining redox balance. Specifically, 70% of human cancers have hyperactivated mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, the master regulator of cellular metabolism. As an important signaling node, mTOR complex 1(mTORC1) integrates upstream stimuli such as growth factors, amino acids and oxygen levels to regulate a myriad of anabolic processes including protein and nucleotide synthesis, RNA biogenesis and lipid metabolism, thereby promoting cell growth. The highly proliferative state of cancer cells, coupled with a change in energy demands, forces these cells to rewire their cellular metabolism to increase production of cellular building blocks like proteins, lipids and nucleotides. De novo lipogenesis provides lipids which act as an integral component of the plasma membrane as well as functioning as signaling molecules. In addition to promoting various anabolic processes, our lab has demonstrated that mTORC1-activated serine\/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase 2 (SRPK2) phosphorylates splicing factors that stabilize lipogenic transcripts, protecting them from nonsense-mediated decay and thereby increasing de novo lipogenesis. This is in contrast to another serine\/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase 1 (SRPK1), which is not regulated by mTORC1. Inhibition of the mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling axis blunts de novo lipogenesis and impedes tumor growth in several tumor xenograft models. SRPK2 overexpression is also observed in lung and colon cancers, suggesting SRPK2 may promote the growth of some human tumors. Despite the emerging role for SRPK2 in tumor growth, very few substrates of this kinase are known. We conducted a phospho-proteomics screen to identify novel substrates of SRPK1 and SRPK2. While some of the targets we identified are regulated in an mTORC1-dependent manner, many appear to be regulated independent of mTORC1, such as PTP1B, EGLN1 and EI24. We hypothesize that these mTORC1-independent targets could be SRPK1-dependent revealing potential distinct branches of SRPK signaling. Future studies will focus on not only validating a subset of these novel targets and their role in tumor growth, but also on exploring mTORC1-dependent and independent SRPK signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/36eb3b4b-f0e2-4c56-90cc-1a01382defa1\/@E03B8ZHK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Cancer,Phosphorylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13121"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kripa Shobana Ganesh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bethany Schaffer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gina Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jared Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomer M.

As such, there is a need to decipher molecular mechanisms that underlie tumor metastasis in ovarian cancer. Increased expression of receptor tyrosine kinase, DDR2, has been associated with worse patient survival. Identifying downstream targets of DDR2may allow specific modulation of ovarian cancer metastatic pathways with few off-target effects. Additionally, stromal cells play a critical role in metastasis. The crosstalk between tumor and stromal cells cans hift the balance between tumor progression or inhibition. We identified periostin to be highly expressed by fibroblasts expressing DDR2compared to fibroblasts without DDR2(Fold change=2.0, P=0.03).We show that DDR2regulates periostin in ovarian cancer associated fibroblast (CAFs). DDR2and periostin expression in the CAFs leads to512% increase in mesothelial cell clearance ratio(P=0.0004) and matrigel invasion(612vs 193invading cells\/hpf, P&#60;0.0001). Mice injected withCAFs expressing periostin as well as ovarian cancer tumor cells have 72% increased tumor burden compared to mice with CAFs that do not express periostin (P=0.006). High periostin expression in CAFs leads to decreased T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. We validate periostin as a marker for patient outcome in ovarian cancer patients. Patients with high periostin expression have worse overall survival thant hose with low periostin expression. Mapping regulatory networks involved in tumor initiation and progression is important for identification of novel therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e4df488d-c143-4d10-890a-7cd3b8aa4136\/@E03B8ZHK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Ovarian cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13122"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Favour A.

The expression of the disease is highly variable as in some cases lead to spontaneously regression without any medical intervention whereas in other cases the tumors become highly metastatic and therapeutically resistant. Our results demonstrated that atypical protein kinase C-iota and zeta (aPKC-&#953;\/&#950;) levels were overexpressed in NB cells (BE-2C and BE-M17) and tissues. The present study shows the downstream effects PKC-&#953; specific inhibitor 5-amino-1-(2,3-dihydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (ICA-1S) and a PKC-&#950; specific inhibitor 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-naphthalenetrisulfonic acid (&#950;-Stat) on aPKCs, 14-3-3, p-14-3-3, Akt1, NF-&#954;B p65, Smad2\/3 and p-Smad2\/3. Decreased Vimentin and increased E-cadherin levels indicated the downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Result also indicated that SNAIL1 transcriptional activity was downregulated as a result of aPKC diminution. SNAIL1 is known to induce EMT. 14-3-3 proteins have the ability to bind a multitude of functionally diverse signaling proteins, including kinases, phosphatases, and transmembrane receptors. Our immunoprecipitation (IP) data suggested that both aPKCs associate with 14-3-3 and Smad2\/3. Our data also indicated that both 14-3-3 and Smad2\/3 levels were significantly decreased as a result of aPKC inhibition. In addition, pI&#954;B, NF&#954;B p65, p-14-3-3, pAkt1, levels were significantly decreased. Our data indicates that 14-3-3 acts as a central key regulator in aPKC driven cell cycle progression in BE-2C and BE-M17 cells. In addition, we found that Smad2\/3 plays a vital role in upregulation of aPKC driven Vimentin dynamics in NB cell lines in relation to 14-3-3. <i>In-vitro<\/i> migration\/invasion assays, IP, immunofluorescence, real time qPCR and Western blot techniques were used to further analyze role of aPKCs in NB malignancy. Data confirmed that aPKC attenuation triggers multiple pro-apoptotic signaling cascades through downregulation of NF&#954;B, Akt, and Smad pathways through downregulation of 14-3-3. <i>I<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>-vivo<\/i> experiments on murine models are being conducted using ICA-1S and &#950;-Stat. Excised tumors will<br \/>be analyzed for pathways observed in <i>in-vitro<\/i> experiments. Overall results suggest that aPKCs are crucial for increased invasiveness in NB. Results suggested that aPKC can be targeted to develop customized, tailored therapies for NB which merit further research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fe685e8d-5911-470b-8f19-f1bbf9a283b8\/@E03B8ZHK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Drug discovery,Kinase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13123"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sloan Breedy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>&#8234;Wishrawana S.

Disruption of its homeostasis can result in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a kinase that plays a central role in multiple signaling pathways including cellular proliferation. Our lab previously performed an siRNA screen to investigate hundreds of kinases to identify candidates which could interact with GSK3. Among the over 500 kinases that were tested, a protein kinase called CDC-like kinase 3 (CLK3) was identified as the strongest interaction with GSK3. We found that inhibition of GSK3 and CLK3 synergized to kill cancer cells. This led us to focus on CLK3 as a potential therapeutic target kinase in colon cancer.<br \/>CLK3 is part of a four-member family of CDC-like kinases involved in pre-mRNA splicing. They are dual-specificity kinases, meaning they can target both tyrosine and serine\/threonine substrates. CLK3 is also a poor prognostic marker in colon cancer, with high expression of CLK3 leading to poor outcome of disease. In human colonic epithelial cells, we show that loss of CLK3 dampens Wnt response. This data, along with the strong genetic interaction with GSK3, suggests a role of CLK3 in the Wnt pathway. Because Wnt signaling is higher in the stem cell region of the crypt, and CLK3 shows a role in Wnt activity in human colonic epithelial cells, we hypothesize that CLK3 regulates mRNA splicing to promote Wnt signaling and stemness in colonic progenitor cells and carcinogenesis.<br \/>We are currently performing transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics in CLK3 CRISPR knockout cells to identify an mRNA-splicing and phosphorylation signature. We have found that the induction of Wnt-related pathway genes are lost in CLK3 knockout cells. Additionally, we are categorizing CLK3-dependent pre-mRNAs splicing events into functional groups controlling cell fate and validating in patient-derived normal and tumor organoid models. This work highlights CLK3 as a critical regulator of gut stem cells and potentially colorectal cancer stem cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/381a4815-01a6-4592-8d4d-5732a2239ea1\/@E03B8ZHK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Cancer stem cell,Wnt pathway,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13124"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carly Cabel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Curtis Thorne<\/i><\/presenter>.

The GRK family of kinases is known for its role in GPCR phosphorylation and desensitization upon GPCR activation by agonists. Besides its role in GPCR phosphorylation, Grk2 has been shown to phosphorylate non-GPCR receptors and cytoplasmic substrates and has also been demonstrated to play phosphorylation-independent roles in cells. Using pooled CRISPR screening we identified that Grk2 knockout inhibits pancreatic and bladder cancer cell line proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in xenografts in vivo, which has not been demonstrated before. Rescue experiments re-expressing wildtype or kinase inactive Grk2 showed that this effect is dependent on catalytically active Grk2. We developed Grk2 inhibitors with exquisite enzymatic potency and anti-proliferative activity in pancreatic cancer cell lines. On a cellular level Grk2 knockout and Grk2 inhibitors slow down G2\/M cell cycle progression in pancreatic cancer cell lines, and Grk2 inhibitor CYG-N-2278 induced a 71% tumor growth inhibition in PAXF1657 pancreatic PDX-derived xenografts. Besides its direct role in cancer cell growth Grk2 also plays a role in immune cell function. Grk2 is highly expressed in immune cells, and we have demonstrated that Grk2 inhibitors upregulate proinflammatory cytokine expression in myeloid cells. In the MC38 colorectal syngeneic tumor model implanted into immunocompetent C57BL6 mice CYG-N-2278 Grk2 inhibitor resulted in a 39% tumor growth inhibition, whereas no effect was observed on MC38 tumor growth in immunodeficient NSG mice, suggesting an immune cell mediated tumor growth inhibition. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data has showed that Grk2 is amplified across multiple tumor types, including bladder, uterine and cholangiocarcinoma cancer, and that Grk2 amplification is prognostic for tumor outcome, confirming the human relevance and suggesting a translatable patient selection strategy. In conclusion, we identified Grk2 as novel target for oncology, demonstrating a direct effect of Grk2 inhibition on cancer cells through inhibiting G2\/M cell cycle progression and an indirect effect on tumor growth through immune cell activation. Cygnal&#8217;s Grk2 inhibitors possess superior potency over previous Grk2 inhibitors and have shown promising preclinical anti-tumor efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c806421f-34d5-4fca-8aea-17bb2177c4ef\/@E03B8ZHK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Pancreatic cancer,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13125"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Alexandra Lantermann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eugene Chekler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce Lefker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Garmen Yuen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanessa Lam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Strickland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justyne Pennacchio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Fulgham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dara Bree<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Perekslis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grazia Piizzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyue Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Wagner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pearl Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

FGFR mutations, fusions, rearrangements, and amplifications have been linked to the pathogenesis of multiple tumor types. For example, approximately 10-15% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma have FGFR2 fusions, and amplification of FGFR2 is prevalent in gastric cancer and implicated in tumor growth. <sup> <\/sup><sup> <\/sup>Approved FGFR inhibitors produce responses in patients that harbor FGFR genetic alterations but show reduced activity against key mutations (e.g., V565, N550, etc.). These pan-FGFR inhibitors also frequently show dose-limiting toxicities including hyperphosphatemia which can be linked to the inhibition of FGFR1. To address these issues, a novel series of FGFR inhibitors that are potent and selective reversible inhibitors of FGFR2 with selectivity over FGFR1 have been identified. This series also maintains activity against clinically relevant mutations in the FGFR2 protein. Inhibition of cellular FGFR phosphorylation was measured using engineered cell lines to demonstrate that the inhibitors target both wild-type FGFR2 and activating FGFR2 mutations while sparing FGFR1. In addition, CDX tumor models showed <i>in vivo<\/i> target engagement and FGFR isoform selectivity.

There is a need to develop better therapies for this patient population. Solid tumors like ovarian cancer respond to hypoxia by inducing the sprouting of new blood cells. This process is called angiogenesis. Angiogenesis leads to formation of disordered and immature vessels that precludes efficient drug delivery. Prior work has shown that overexpressing DDR2 in endothelial cells leads to increased angiogenic activity, measured by tube formation and sprouting. We show that DDR2 expression in ovarian cancer tumor cells modulates angiogenic activity in endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured in conditioned media from DDR2-expressing tumor cells (ES2 shSCRM) have 20% increase in tube length and 18% increase in sprout network area than HUVECs cultured in conditioned media from DDR2-depleted tumor cells (ES2 shDDR2) (P=0.032). This difference in HUVEC angiogenesis is mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We observed a 16% decrease in VEGF levels in conditioned media from ES2 shDDR2 cells compared to media from ES2 shSCRM cells (P&#8203;&#8203;&#60;0.0001). DDR2 WT mice bearing ID8 Trp53-\/- BRCA2-\/- tumors have 53% more CD31+ microvessels than DDR2 KO mice (P&#8203;&#8203;&#60;0.0001). We also identified that DDR2&#8217;s role in angiogenesis is mediated by the Hsp70\/90 chaperone machinery. In summary, we have identified that DDR2 regulates angiogenesis in ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ecce855-3533-4cc3-9e9d-6445156b3044\/@E03B8ZHK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,Ovarian cancer,Tyrosine kinase,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13127"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Favour A.

Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylate DAG to produce PA, acting as a central switch between the various signal transduction pathways activated by these second messengers. Ten DGK isoforms (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, &#949;, &#950;, &#951;, &#952;, &#953;, and &#954;) have been identified and categorized into five classes based on their structural features. DGK&#945; is highly expressed in several cancers including hepatoma, lymphoma and melanoma, and has been shown to promote cancer survival by positively regulating proliferative activity through several signaling pathways, attracting interest to DGK&#945; as a potential therapeutic target. DGK&#945; and &#950; are expressed at high levels in T cells, and shown to promote T cell anergy, pointing to inhibition of these DGK isoforms as a means of enhancing T cell anti-tumor activity and restoring T cells function. Several DGK isoforms have also been implicated in disease contexts such as hypertension, autoimmunity, type II diabetes, epilepsy, and bipolar disorder. Current DGK inhibitor discovery efforts are focused on DGK&#945; and &#950;, but to our knowledge no compounds have proceeded to clinical trial-to date. To facilitate these efforts, we have developed a DGK screening panel including compound profiling assays for all DGK isoforms. This is an essential tool for identification of potent and isoform selective inhibitors towards therapeutically relevant DGK isoforms.

This maintenance of tissue patterning is often dysregulated during cancer development. In order to study tissue patterning, temporal and spatial resolution of communication between single cells is required. To explore how this complex process is controlled, we developed a patient-derived organoid screening platform to study both tissue patterning and kinase pathway dynamics in single cells across hundreds of conditions. Unlike normal and polyp-derived organoids, tumor organoids displayed a lack of patterning reminiscent of <i>in vivo<\/i> dysplasia. Using this system, we discovered that waves of Erk signaling induced by apoptotic cells are critical for maintaining tissue patterning in human colonic organoids. Using a small molecule-based screen, we discovered novel kinases which limit Erk activation across tissues and help maintain patterning.

Cancer Res.<\/i> 2008, 14 (4), 971-976., <i>Oncogenesis<\/i> 2019, 8 (11), 1-11). It is a highly invasive tumor that originates in the cerebellum and has the ability to metastasize throughout the central nervous system early in its course. The median age of diagnosis is 5 years, with 80% of cases being diagnosed in the first 15 years (<i>Asian J. Neurosurg.<\/i> 2015, 10 (1), 1-4). Current treatment options include maximal safe resection, chemotherapy and craniospinal radiation (<i>J. Neurosurg. Pediatr. <\/i>2019, 24(4), 353-363). Despite such aggressive therapeutic treatments, nearly 30% of afflicted patients succumb to this disease, and survivors cope with the long-term side effects of these treatments that have significant impacts on their quality of life (<i>J. Neurosurg. Pediatr.<\/i> 2019, 24(4), 353-363). This underscores the need for less invasive and more effective treatment methods to improve overall patient outcomes. We believe that oncogene expression resulting from the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is responsible for upregulating malignant cancer cell growth, cell survival, and migration. Preliminary dose curve studies, in which D341 and D283 medulloblastoma cell lines were treated with novel atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) inhibitors 2-acetyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione (ACPD) and 3,4-diaminonapthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid (DNDA) (<i>Int. J. Oncol.<\/i> 2017, 51(5), 1370-1382), have been shown to significantly decrease cell proliferation with increasing inhibitor concentration. Cell line D341 showed 44.2% inhibition when treated with 10 &#181;M of ACPD and 75.2% inhibition when treated with 1 &#181;M of DNDA while cell line D283 showed a 63.2% inhibition at 5 &#181;M of ACPD and 73.6% inhibition at 10 &#181;M. Future studies will be conducted to determine the inhibition mechanism of the Hh pathway in medulloblastoma by probing for different cell cycle and oncoprotein markers using Western blotting, employing the WST-1 assay to evaluate cell viability and cytotoxicity, and implementing migration and invasion assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8609e812-97c7-4442-ae42-58d213d82e2d\/@w03B8ZHL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell signaling,Protein kinase C,Hedgehog,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18172"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luke Lajmi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sloan Breedy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wishrawana S.
