[{"Abstract":"We have previously identified the p38 substrate MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2) as a radiation response stress pathway regulating inflammatory cytokine production that facilitates EMT pathway activation and tumor growth in head and neck cancer. Here we examine whether MK2 knockdown in bladder cancer cells alters their ability to produce immune mediators and to resist radiation.In order to study the impact of MK2 in bladder cancer (i.e., T24, HTB9), we generated both scrambled control (SCR) and MK2 shRNA using a lentiviral transduction system and selected for clones via puromycin selection. Generally, all MK2 shRNA clones demonstrated &#62;88% reduction in MK2 protein expression by immunoblot. Increased phosphorylation of MK2 (p272) compared to control was detected 48 hours after the exposure of cells to 10 Gy radiation which was not seen in shRNA cells. Gene expression analysis of the bladder cells at 48 or 72 hours after 10 Gy radiation showed an increase in the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF&#945; and genes that regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition; SNAI1 and vimentin. A reduced expression of these genes was seen in the shRNA cells following radiation demonstrating MK2 as an important signaling molecule in this response. We then examined whether MK2 also impacted tumor proliferation, radiosensitivity and the cell cycle. The proliferation rates of shRNA cells compared to SCR cells showed no difference under control conditions in both cell lines. However, in response to radiation both T24 and HTB9 shRNA cells showed a greater loss of cells compared to SCR as determined by CyQUANT DNA fluorescence at 24, 48, 72 and 144 hours. Furthermore, shRNA cells showed reduced clonogenic activity after radiation compared to SCR as determined by colony-forming assays using 0-10 Gy doses in 2 Gy increments. Analysis of cell cycle changes induced by radiation at 28 hours showed a pronounced shift of HTB9 cells from 57.8 (% G1 Phase), 19.1 (% S phase) and 22.1 (% G2\/M) phase to 7.6, 3.4, 86.7. This pattern was significantly different in shRNA cells that showed proportions of 46.2, 17.8, 32.0 without radiation which shifted to 20.6, 5.9 and 67.3 28 hours after irradiation. The percentage of cells in G1, and G2\/M phase 28 hours after irradiation was significantly different between SCR and shRNA (p&#60;0.001) suggesting that MK2 knockdown altered radiosensitivity by impacting cell cycle kinetics.In summary, we measured a significant increase in the sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to radiation following knockdown of MK2. The data suggests a reduction in survival of tumors cells exposed to radiation with MK2 knockdown through cell cycle changes and reduced production of survival and growth signals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ef51c72d-1941-4ee3-8ecd-f114a5665408\/@v03B8ZK9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Radiation-induced DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),Radiosensitivity,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13627"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Deri Morgan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Millington<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanna Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colby Spiess<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kiersten L.

Investigating the various mechanisms underlying dysfunctional DNA damage response (DDR) and heterogeneity across patients will be crucial to understand disparate responses to therapy, including to PARP1 inhibitors and to immunotherapy. In this study, we integrate genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and post-translational modification (PTM) data across 11 cancer types to elucidate the diverse functional mechanisms of DNA repair deficiencies and their therapeutic implications through an in-depth proteogenomic analysis. We first characterized the landscape of mutational signatures in 1110 patients by applying SignatureAnalyzer, a tool that uses a Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization method to discover patterns of somatic mutations. Our analysis identified 144 homologous recombination-deficient (HRD) and 60 mismatch repair-deficient (MMRD) patients. Multi-omic (mRNA, protein, PTMs) signature based hierarchical clustering revealed two distinct clusters of HRD patients defined by either (i) acute or (ii) chronic hypoxic states. The acute hypoxia cluster exhibited typical HRD phenotypes, including a preference for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and enrichment in PARP1 activity, as well as phosphorylation patterns driven by DNA-PKcs, ATM, and ATR. In contrast, tumors under chronic hypoxia exhibited a halting of replication and silencing of DDR, suggesting that patients with these tumors may respond poorly to common HRD treatments that exploit alternative error-prone repair and PARP1 activation. Notably, these tumors were enriched in signatures representative of highly active kinases involved in cellular stress responses, potentially providing additional avenues for therapy. Additional analysis of both HRD and MMRD tumors revealed groups of highly immunogenic DNA repair-deficient tumors that may respond well to some types of immunotherapy given their increased mutagenesis. Moreover, differences in inflammation-related kinase activities offer further insight into the interaction between faulty DDR and the innate immune response (e.g., alterations in the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway). Overall, our multi-omic signature analysis provides insights into the mechanisms underlying DDR and its crosstalk with other cancer-related pathways that remain unexplained by evaluating genomic and transcriptomic data alone. Our characterization of the heterogeneity within the population of patients with DNA repair deficiency shows promise for improved prediction of treatment response, as well as identifying additional potential therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/81d20923-45c7-4146-98a0-817390e17873\/@v03B8ZK9\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Mechanisms of genomic alterations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Multiomics,Mutational signatures,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13629"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yo Akiyama<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yifat Geffen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shankara Anand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomer Yaron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jared L.

The anticancer effects of PARPi are most effective in tumors with BRCA mutations and homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRD). One mechanism of PARPi resistance is through restoration of HR repair. Our group has shown that entinostat (an HDACi) potentiates the effects of olaparib (a PARPi). The objective of this study was to investigate mechanisms of intrinsic PARPi resistance by studying the combination of entinostat and olaparib in HR proficient and HR deficient mouse ovarian cancer cell lines.<br \/>We used the ID8 <i>TP53<\/i> null (HR proficient) and ID8 <i>TP53<\/i> null\/<i>BRCA2 <\/i>null (HR deficient) mouse ovarian cancer cell lines that harbor molecular features consistent with human high-grade serous ovarian cancer. To recapitulate an ongoing clinical trial using this drug combination, cells were pre-treated with 0.25 &#181;M Entinostat or control for 24 hours, followed by 24 or 72 hours of drug treatment [0.5 &#181;M Entinostat, 10 &#181;M of Olaparib, the combination of both, or control]. Clonogenicity assays were used to assess colony formation and MTS assays were used to measure cell viability and proliferation. We then performed immunofluorescence (IF) staining for RAD51 (a marker for HR repair), &#947;H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) and Ki67 (a marker of proliferation).<br \/>As expected in the clonogenicity assay, there was no statistically significant difference in cell survival between the olaparib treated ID8 <i>TP53<\/i> null (HR proficient) cells and vehicle-treated controls (p= 0.0993; paired t test). Alternatively, the ID8 <i>TP53 <\/i>null\/<i>BRCA2 <\/i>null (HR deficient) cell line treated with olaparib alone reduced cell viability compared to control (p=0.0245; paired t test). Clonogenicity assays also demonstrated that the combination of entinostat and olaparib reduced colony formation compared to control in the ID8 <i>TP53<\/i> null cell line (p&#60;0.0001; one-way ANOVA). MTS assays corroborated this treatment effect (p&#60; 0.0001; two way ANOVA). Preliminary data suggests that compared to controls and each drug alone, IF staining for RAD51 and Ki67 expression was reduced in cells treated with combination therapy. Also preliminarily, there was increased number of &#947;H2AX foci in combination treatment compared to controls and each drug alone.<br \/>Entinostat restores responsiveness to olaparib in ID8 <i>TP53<\/i> null HR proficient mouse ovarian cancer cells that molecularly resemble high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. These results suggest this drug combination can overcome intrinsic resistance to PARPi and provide additional preclinical support for clinical investigation of this combination for the treatment of HR proficient ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4b78608e-c41f-4636-82df-3cb17ff27daa\/@w03B8ZKa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,HDAC inhibitor,Ovarian cancer,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13630"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tyler Woodard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Viju Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simona Miceska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bisiayo Fashemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wendy Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dineo Khabele<\/i><\/presenter>.

While inhibitors of targets in the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway, such as DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), are available for clinical use, it remains unclear which cancers are vulnerable to these agents. In a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen with the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, we identify loss of <i>POLQ<\/i>, encoding polymerase theta, and other genes in the microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway as key predictors of sensitivity to DNA-PK inhibition, whereas loss of <i>TP53 <\/i>conferred resistance to DNA-PK inhibition. Inhibition of DNA-PK led to increased DNA double strand break end-resection, increased expression of polymerase theta, and activation of MMEJ repair. Combined DNA-PK inhibition by M3814 and polymerase theta inhibition by novobiocin resulted in synthetic lethality mediated by the accumulation of resected DNA and apoptosis. Significantly, this drug combination efficiently killed <i>TP53<\/i>-deficient human patient-derived xenografts and the corresponding tumor organoids. Taken together, our results provide a rationale for the combination of an inhibitor of DNA-PK mediated NHEJ and an inhibitor of polymerase theta mediated MMEJ in an anti-cancer trial. If DNA-PK is inhibited, cancers develop a hyper-dependence on MMEJ and an upregulation of DNA double strand break end resection and polymerase theta expression. Similarly, P53-deficiency which confers resistance to DNA-PK inhibition, also leads to a hyper-dependence on MMEJ and an upregulation of polymerase theta expression. Thus, a combination of DNA-PK and polymerase theta inhibitors may provide a precision treatment strategy for <i>TP53-<\/i>mutant solid tumors, known to account for 50% of newly diagnosed cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ecd2ceb-d230-487e-9dbe-29647158be72\/@w03B8ZKa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nonhomologous end joining,Polymerase theta,p53,DNA repair,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13631"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeffrey Patterson-Fortin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arindam Bose<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei-Chih Tsai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carter Grochala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huy Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jia Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kalindi Parmar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Bernard Lazaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joyce Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelsey McQueen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geoffrey I.

However, the role of such mutations in modulation of cell&#8217;s response to radiation therapy is poorly understood. In this study, we define the role of ESR1 mutations in altering response to radiation therapy in pre-clinical models of ER-positive breast cancer. To investigate whether ESR1 mutations influence cell&#8217;s response to radiation therapy, we employed ER-positive MCF7 and T47D cell lines which have been genome edited to knock-in two of the most common ESR1 mutations, such as Y537S and D538G, found in breast cancer patients. Clonogenic survival assays were carried out to characterize differences in radiation sensitivity of these cells. g-H2AX and Comet assays were employed to study the differences in residual unrepaired DNA damage following radiation in these cell lines. MCF7 cell line-derived xenografts harboring the wild type or mutant ESR1 were employed to study differences in radiation resistance of these tumors in vivo. We found that ER-positive cell lines harboring ESR1 mutations exhibited profound resistance to radiation therapy compared to cell lines harboring the wild type ESR1. These radioresistant cell lines also demonstrated significantly less unrepaired DNA damage following radiation therapy. We observed that mice harboring ESR1 mutant xenografts showed remarkable resistance to radiation therapy. We also observed that ESR1 mutations, which confer resistance to endocrine therapies, also confer profound resistance to radiation therapy. Our findings suggest that oligometastatic ER-positive breast cancer patients who are being treated with radiation therapy (such as those enrolled in NRG BR002 trial) may show significant differences in response to radiation therapy based on their ESR1 mutation status. Recent studies are also exploring the use of neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy in non-metastatic ER-positive breast cancer patients. It is conceivable that some of these patients may acquire ESR1 mutations under selective pressure of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and may respond poorly to subsequent adjuvant radiation therapy. Overall, our findings support potential personalization of radiation treatments in breast cancer patients based on ESR1 mutation status, heralding an era of precision radiation oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2deb50ac-ab46-4d5c-ad04-bca0501ef3d8\/@w03B8ZKa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Radiation-induced DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor,Mutations,Radioresistance,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13632"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>S.

These alterations may also identify patients eligible for treatment with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum drugs that exploit synthetic lethality; however, resistance eventually occurs. This resistance is largely the result of reversion mutations, which restore the DNA repair function of mutated HR genes.<br \/>We employed a computational approach to identify patients with breast, ovarian, pancreas, or prostate cancer who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP; Foundation Medicine, Inc.) and had reversion mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, or RAD51D genes. Reversion mutations were identified in six different categories: 1) missense mutations that occur at the same amino acid position as a deleterious alteration, 2) non-frameshift deletion mutations that encompass a deleterious alteration, 3) frameshift mutations that restore the open reading frame of another frameshift mutation, 4) splice-site mutations that occur at the same exon as a deleterious alteration, 5) copy number losses that remove a deleterious alteration, and 6) intragenic deletions that lead to loss of deleterious mutation.<br \/>Using our computational approach, we identified 483 patients who 1,112 reversion mutation pairs in both solid tissue- and liquid biopsy-derived samples. The most frequently observed category was a non-frameshift deletion of a deleterious mutation. Overall, a greater number of reversion mutations were found in liquid biopsy samples. BRCA2 was the most frequently reverted gene followed by BRCA1, PALB2, RAD51D, and RAD51C. BRCA1-mutated samples had up to six reversion mutations, and for BRCA2, we observed as many as 228 putative reversion pairs in one sample. PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D had no more than two reversion mutations. We further examined co-occurring alterations and found correlations with genes in multiple signaling pathways including the MYC signaling pathway, which contained more mutations in reversion-positive samples. Lastly, we explored real-world longitudinal data from reversion-positive samples and found that the presence of a reversion mutation was significantly associated with lower overall survival for breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer patients. In summary, we characterized the landscape of reversion mutations in patients who underwent tissue or liquid biopsy-based CGP during clinical cancer treatment. Our data provide a better perspective for the identification and treatment of cancers involving a reversion mechanism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/597639d0-a0d3-4c1f-a589-29453e942315\/@w03B8ZKa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,DNA repair,Genomics,PARP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13633"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shannon T.

MMR is the DNA repair mechanism that repairs DNA mispairs and small insertions or deletions remaining after replication. MMR is also required for apoptosis after certain types of exogenous DNA damage that result in damage-associated mispairs. MMR defects are the underlying cause of Lynch syndrome, a familial cancer predisposition syndrome that increases susceptibility to multiple cancers, specifically colorectal cancer. MMR defects are also commonly found in sporadic colorectal cancers. Model systems such as <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, <\/i>and human cell lines have been used to study the MMR proteins and pathways. The basics of the MMR mechanism are fairly well understood; however, proteins associated with MMR are still being identified, and the roles of these proteins are largely unknown. We have identified the yeast protein Rad5 as an interactor with the yeast MMR proteins Msh2 and Mlh1. Rad5 is a helicase and an E3 ubiquitin ligase<i> <\/i>which is involved in post-replicative repair and damage tolerance. However, to date, Rad5 has no known role in MMR. We have determined that these interactions are conserved through evolution to human Rad5 homologs, HLTF and SHPRH. The Rad5 interactions with Mlh1 and Msh2 appear to be split between the human homologs with human Msh2 interacting with HLTF and human Mlh1 interacting with SHPRH. We have found that loss of SHPRH induces resistance to MMR-mediated apoptosis. Current experiments are in progress to determine the binding sites between these proteins. We are also investigating what functional impact the Rad5 homologs have on mutation rate and MMR-induced apoptosis and how the interactions affect the roles of MMR. Together this will allow for a deeper understanding of how accessory proteins may influence canonical and non-canonical MMR. Since MMR status is currently used to determine patient treatment, understanding how commonly mutated accessory factors interact is critical.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d9ea3066-1aa6-4e1d-a307-2c3cbf42597f\/@w03B8ZKa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mismatch repair,DNA damage,Protein Interactions,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13634"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Kristin Miller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guogen Mao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Rahal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Putnam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Goellner<\/i><\/presenter>.

The chaotic genome of most osteosarcomas has led many to assume that this complexity must accumulate under conditions of significant genomic\/chromosomal instability. However, such conclusions have been drawn primarily from single-timepoint bulk-tumor analyses. More recent studies have questioned this assumption of chromosomal instability, hypothesizing that genomic complexity could arise from an early catastrophic event followed by faithful propagation of a highly complex, malignancy-promoting genome.<br \/>To determine whether osteosarcoma tumors show evidence of instability, we performed single-cell whole-genome sequencing of &#62;14,000 osteosarcoma cells obtained from 15 distinct lesions resected from 8 individual patients. Using the CHISEL algorithm, we inferred allele- and haplotype-specific copy numbers from this sequencing data. To evaluate how the SCNA profiles changed during the evolutionary pressures associated with metastatic dissemination and therapy, we compared the single-cell SCNA profiles of paired samples collected from both primary sites and metastases and from pre-treatment and relapsed specimens. We likewise compared profiles of patient tumors propagated orthotopically in mouse tibias to those grown within the lung to evaluate for tissue-dependent emergence of rare subclones.<br \/>Despite extensive structural variations that give rise to highly complex patterns of SCNA, the cells within each tumor showed remarkably little heterogeneity. We found similar evidence of chromosomal stability when we reconstructed phylogenetic trees to identify the evolutionary relationships of cells collected from metastatic lesions or at relapse. Despite being evolutionarily distant, nearly all variants could be assigned to the trunk of the phylogenetic tree, with only modest changes occurring in the branches. This result suggests that nearly all SCNAs were acquired in an early event, followed by selection of advantageous patterns with subsequent preservation of that particular SCNA pattern. Analysis of bulk whole-genome sequencing from serially collected patient samples supports the preservation of SCNA profiles over time.<br \/>This work demonstrates the power of combining single-cell DNA sequencing with an allele- and haplotype-specific CNV inference algorithm. Our approach clarifies longstanding questions about the genetics of osteosarcoma initiation and progression, calling into question previous assumptions of genomic instability inferred from single-timepoint bulk sequencing data. These results suggest that an isolated, early catastrophic event, rather than sustained genomic instability, gives rise to the complex genome that characterizes osteosarcoma tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/45044c27-0f32-4492-9db4-a7f257ccbf37\/@w03B8ZKa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Osteosarcoma,Single cell,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13637"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sanjana Rajan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Zaccaria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Cannon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maren Cam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Gross<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Raphael<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ryan D.

The clinical response to DNA-damaging therapies is varied within and across cancer subtypes where a robust DNA damage response (DDR) predicts recalcitrance. Replication protein A (RPA) is the predominant human single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, playing essential roles in DNA replication, repair, recombination, and the DNA-damage response (DDR). Inhibition of the RPA&#8722;DNA interaction is an approach to cancer drug discovery that holds potential to provide single-agent activity and\/or synergy with existing therapeutics. Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) based drug design presages a paradigm shift within drug discovery as PROTACs begin to carve out a space in the clinical landscape. The PROTAC platform is particularly suited for drugging overexpressed proteins such as RPA because iterative target degradation improves drug:target stoichiometry and precludes RPA&#8217;s role in protein scaffolding. Herein, we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of an RPA targeted PROTAC library conceived by conjugation of the diaryl pyrazole RPA inhibitor <b>TDRL-551<\/b> and an E3-ligand via a linker of variable length and composition. Residing within the beyond rule of five (bRo5) chemical space, careful consideration was given to minimize the liability to cell permeability imposed by the high molecular weight of PROTACs. Excitingly, cellular uptake across the compound library was broadly improved relative to the unconjugated warhead <b>TDRL-551<\/b>. Similarly, RPA engagement by the PROTAC series was widely unhindered and, in many cases, improved relative to the warhead <b>TDRL-551<\/b>.

While the BRCA proteins play a well-established role in double-stranded DNA break repair, recent studies have revealed an emerging role of BRCA1\/2 in replication stress response. While replication forks are extensively degraded by nucleases in BRCA-deficient cancer cells, activation of specialized fork recovery mechanisms enables resumption of DNA synthesis and promotes cell survival. My project aims to determine this fork recovery mechanism in BRCA1-deficient cells and to identify potential recovery factors that can be targeted to improve chemotherapeutic response in BRCA1-mutated breast and ovarian cancers. To monitor perturbations in replication fork dynamics on a genome-wide scale, we utilize a DNA fiber assay technique measuring rates of fork recovery and replication fork degradation. In parallel, electron microscopy analysis allows direct visualization of replication fork intermediates. Cell survival assays are employed to test how loss of fork recovery factors impacts cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic response in BRCA1-deficient cells. Our results reveal that RAD18 and UBC13, which catalyze ubiquitination of Proliferating Cellular Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), promote fork recovery in BRCA1-deficient, but not BRCA2-deficient, cancer cells. Previous work has also shown that PCNA polyubiquitination by UBC13 is important for reversed fork formation in BRCA-proficient cells. However, our findings show that extensive degradation of reversed fork substrates still occurs in BRCA1-deficient cells lacking RAD18 or UBC13, indicating that PCNA polyubiquitination is not essential for fork reversal in this genetic background. In addition, loss of RAD18 in BRCA1-deficient cells significantly slows cell proliferation, and UBC13 inhibition further sensitizes cells lacking BRCA1 to the replication stress inducer Hydroxyurea (HU). Based on our findings, we hypothesize that RAD18, UBC13, and PCNA ubiquitination may represent novel targets to improve chemoresponse in BRCA1-deficient cancers that rely on fork recovery mechanisms for survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40a7d2b7-27a8-4b59-895d-8f208fbe356a\/@w03B8ZKa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA replication,BRCA,Ovarian cancer,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13639"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emily Cybulla<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Jackson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Tirman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annabel Quinet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Delphine Lemacon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Vindigni<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here we have elucidated a pathway that process trapped PARP1. By exploiting wild-type or trapping-resistant PARP1 transgenes combined with either a rapid immunoprecipitation mass-spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME)-based approach or PARP1 Apex2-proximity labelling linked to mass-spectrometry, we generated proteomic profiles of trapped and non-trapped PARP1 complexes. These experiments demonstrated an increase in the SUMO1\/2 modifications upon trapping, as well as an interaction with the ubiquitin-regulated p97 ATPase (aka VCP). Subsequent experiments demonstrated that upon trapping, PARP1 is SUMOylated by the SUMO-ligase PIAS4 and subsequently ubiquitinated by the SUMO-targeted E3-ubiquitin ligase, RNF4, events that promote p97 recruitment and p97 ATPase-mediated removal of trapped-PARP1 from chromatin. Consistently, small molecule p97 complex inhibitors, including a metabolite of the clinically-used drug disulfiram, CuET that acts as a p97 sequestration agent, prolong PARP1 trapping and thus enhance PARPi-induced cytotoxicity in homologous recombination defective tumor cells and patient-derived tumor organoids. Taken together, these results suggest that p97 ATPase plays a key role in the processing of trapped PARP1 from chromatin and the response of homologous recombination defective tumor cells to PARPi.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c18c88fe-715b-41d9-98cf-3ac923270e5f\/@w03B8ZKa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,PARP,Ubiquitination,BRCA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13641"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dragomir B.

However, non-germline <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> mutated tumors and homologous recombination repair deficient (HRD) tumors with unknown etiology are probably also PARP inhibitor-sensitive. Various HRD biomarkers have been proposed and their clinical validity and utility are under investigation. We recently described the functional REpair CAPacity (RECAP) test as a real-time method to select HRD tumors based on their inability to form RAD51 foci. Here, we investigated whether this functional test defines a similar group of HRD tumors as DNA-based tests for primary and metastatic BCs.<br \/><b>Materials and<\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> A cohort (n=71; 52 primary and 19 metastatic BCs) enriched for HRD tumors was selected based on the RECAP test, consisting of 26 RECAP-HRD (37%), 9 RECAP-HR intermediate (HRi; 13%) and 36 RECAP-HR proficient (HRP; 51%) tumors. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out on matched germline and tumor DNA samples for 38 primary BCs and the 19 metastatic lesions, for which material was available. Three samples were excluded due to a low purity score (&#60;0.2), thus WGS data was present for 54 tumors. The tumors were subjected to DNA-based HRD tests: CHORD and BRCA1\/2-like classifier algorithms. Concordance between different HRD tests was reached when a tumor was classified as HRD\/HRi or HRP by both tests.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The RECAP test identified all bi-allelic <i>BRCA<\/i> deficient samples (n=15) in this cohort as HRD\/HRi. Within the remaining non-BRCA RECAP-HRD\/HRi samples, there were no pathogenic mutations in other relevant genes that could explain the HRD status of these tumors. In the RECAP-HR proficient tumors no bi-allelic <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> deficiencies were identified. The RECAP status partially correlated with the DNA-based HRD test outcomes using the HRDetect, CHORD and BRCA1\/2-like classifier algorithms (70% concordance for RECAP-CHORD and RECAP-BRCA1\/2-like classifier, and 66% for CHORD-BRCA1\/2-like classifier). However, RECAP identified additional samples unable to form RAD51 foci. The discordance among the tests were evenly distributed among the primary and metastatic BCs.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The difference between RECAP and other HRD tests in BC patients is relatively large (30-34% discordance), implying that RECAP may be identifying deficiencies in other components of DNA repair which could also result in PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Therefore, direct comparison of these HRD tests in clinical trials will be required to evaluate the optimal predictive test for clinical decision making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad76dd89-1f9c-4f13-8ad1-6d0df666d5ac\/@w03B8ZKa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,BRCA,homologous recombination deficiency,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13642"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Titia G.

Despite recent advances in cancer diagnostics, it is a cancer that is often detected late. After treatment with debulking surgery and chemotherapy, 80% of patients have tumor relapse. Early detection efforts have been largely unsuccessful and the only effective prevention strategy in high risk patients is surgical removal of the fallopian tube and ovaries. Careful pathologic studies of prophylactic risk reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) has demonstrated that the origins of HGSC is likely within secretory cells of the fimbriae in the fallopian tube. This is based on numerous lines of correlative evidence including the identification of abnormal regions in the fallopian tube called serous tubal intraepithelial cancer (STIC) in 10-15% of patients undergoing RRSO, <u>and<\/u><u> <\/u>the presence of STIC in half of patients undergoing debulking surgeries for HGSC<u>. <\/u>Finally<u>,<\/u> p53 mutations have been found to be identical in STIC and in the concurrent invasive disease indicating that HGSC and the STIC likely arise from the same clone. TCGA analysis has demonstrated that HCSC is a disease characterized by genomic and chromosomal instability harboring copy number alteration, including amplifications, deletions and more complex chromosomal rearrangements which impact multiple genes and pathways. Aberrantly segregating chromosomes that lag behind the spindle apparatus fail to become part of the primary nucleus (PN) and are instead enclosed by a self-assembled nuclear membrane, creating a structure called the micronucleus (MN). Spontaneous breakdown of the MN causes cytoplasmic DNA sensing and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway<u> <\/u>an important innate cellular defense mechanism to foreign cytoplasmic DNA. To understand the early genomic and signaling events in the development of HGSC, we are interrogating FFPE tissue from our archives from MSKCC patients who have undergone RRSO, hormone ablation surgeries or surgical debulking and were found to have benign fallopian tube, STIC lesions or invasive disease with STIC. We have performed a pilot experiment of 20 patient samples of different genetic backgrounds. Intriguingly, cGAS signaling was observed only rarely in the STICs indicating low rates of CIN in STICs, however we note that even in early invasive disease, we observe cGAS positivity. Moreover, we observe robust CD8+ T cell localization to early invasive disease. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model where CIN and subsequent cGAS\/STING pathway activation drives the transition from pre-invasive to invasive disease with early immune recognition that is lost in invasive disease. We propose a model of ovarian cancer development where fallopian tube secretory transition from a p53 WT SCOUT to p53 mutant state STIL acquire a proliferative capacity forming a STIC and then develop CIN transitioning to invasive disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/28e8e47b-ce84-4550-8c80-76e970986e9e\/@x03B8ZKb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Ovarian cancer,Fluorescence imaging,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13644"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Duaa Hassan Al-Rawi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Herman Chui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sorhab Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Bakhoum<\/i><\/presenter>.

These observations are consistent with the increase in RPA expression serving as an adaptive mechanism that allows tolerance of the genotoxic stress resulting from carcinogen exposure.

Over the last years, the clinical utility of this therapeutic concept was successfully demonstrated in ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer. Currently, the role of HRD is investigated in trials testing immune checkpoint blockers alone or in combination with PARP inhibitors. But the relationship between HRD and immune cell contexture in cancer is incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed the association of HRD with tumor mutational burden (TMB), immune cell composition and gene expression in 10,000 tumors of 32 solid cancer types from the TCGA project. For each of the tumors, the HRD sum score (HRDsum) was calculated from allele-specific copy numbers (derived from genotyping data) and the TMB was calculated from the missense mutation calls (derived from WES data). HRDsum and tumor mutational burden (TMB) correlated positively pan-cancer (R=0.42) and within most cancer types. By contrast, HRD was absent in ultra-hypermutated (TMB &#62;= 100 mut\/Mb) tumors. Ultra-hypermutation was typically associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) or POLE\/POLD1 mutation. Significant positive correlation of the HRDsum and immune cell infiltration was observed pan-cancer, but only within a few cancer types. Significant positive correlation of HRDsum and the T-cell inflamed gene expression profile was observed only in 7 of 32 cancer types: in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, low grade glioma, testicular germ cell tumors and three kinds of kidney cancer. A functional genomics analysis was carried out by correlating genome-wide gene expression data (derived from RNA-Seq) with HRDsum. The resulting lists of significantly correlating genes were analyzed for enrichment of 50 hallmark gene sets (catalog H, MSigDB). We detected simultaneous enrichment of two proliferation-related categories, E2F_TARGETS and G2M_checkpoint, for 13 of the 32 cancer types (ACC, BLCA, BRCA, KIRC, KIRP, LGG, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC, MESO, PRAD, SARC, THYM). The study shows that HRD is associated with immunological activation of the tumor microenvironment only in a minority of cancer types. Our data support further studies of immune activating therapies in combination with immune checkpoint blockade in the not intrinsically activated cancer types and advocate to combine different genomic and transcriptomic biomarkers (including HRD and TMB) for comprehensive molecular diagnostics and therapy guidance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/709e026d-63e3-49e3-920f-d86def30759f\/@x03B8ZKb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,Immuno-oncology,PARP inhibitors,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13649"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jan Budczies<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Klaus Kluck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susanne Beck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iordanis Ouralidis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Allgäuer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Menzel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eugen Rempel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Kazdal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukas Perkhofer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Kleger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Schirmacher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Seufferlein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albrecht Stenzinger<\/i><\/presenter>.

Clinical translation of these agents in combination with radiotherapy (RT) has been limited due to concerns for increased normal tissue toxicity. Pharmacologic Ascorbate (P-AscH-) radiosensitizes cancer cells via generation of a H2O2 flux while acting as a radioprotector in normal tissue via free radicle scavenging. We hypothesized that P-AscH- could open a therapeutic window for the combination of RT and ATM inhibition in colorectal cancer (CRC).<br \/><b>Materials\/Methods: <\/b>Multiple human and murine CRC cell lines were used <i>in vitro<\/i>. Clonogenic survival was assessed after combinations of RT +\/- P-AscH and DNA Repair Inhibitors (DRIs). Catalase expression was induced using HCT116 cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible catalase transgene. DSBs were quantified using neutral comet assays. Cell cycle distribution were assessed using flow cytometry. ATM localization\/activation were assessed using IF. Normal tissue toxicity <i>in vivo<\/i> was assessed using IHC following whole-abdominal RT. Survival and tumor growth delay was assessed following 5Gyx3 +\/- drug treatment to unilateral flank tumors in syngeneic\/xenograft models.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>DRIs were potent radiosensitizers in most CRC cell lines and the addition of P-AscH<sup>-<\/sup> further reduced clonogenic survival. In contrast, P-AscH<sup>-<\/sup> did not radiosensitize HUVEC or FHs-74int normal cell lines. P-AscH<sup>-<\/sup> significantly increased the number of DSBs in tumors after RT <i>in vitro<\/i>.

RAD51 plays an essential role in homologous recombination with BRCA2. Recently, RAD51 has been highlighted to play a role in resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors. We hypothesized that RAD51 as a prognostic and predictive biomarker of drug sensitivity in breast cancer.<br \/><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:<\/b> Total of 4500 primary breast cancer patients from three independent cohorts were examined. High and low expression of RAD51 were divided by median RNA expression. Response to treatments were assessed in total of 3000 patients across 11 independent cohorts of breast cancer patients that received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> RAD51 was upregulated in cancer compared to normal tissues in the TCGA cohort and was positively correlated with HRD. Cancer with high RAD51 group enriched DNA repair gene set in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in all cohorts and had high expression of HRD-related genes including BRCA1 and BRCA2. Histological grade and Ki67 expression were positively correlated with RAD51, and all cancer proliferation gene sets from Hallmark (E2F target, G2M checkpoint, Myc Targets v1 and v2, and Mitotic Spindle) were strongly enriched in the high RAD51 expression breast cancer in all cohorts. In TCGA, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen were also higher in tumor with high RAD51 expression, but RAD51 expression was not elevated in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutant tumors. Cytolytic activity score, a marker of cancer immunity, was elevated high RAD51 group in two cohorts, and the immune cell fraction calculated by the xCell algorithm showed increase in immune cell infiltration, including CD4 memory T cells, Th1 cells, M1 macrophages and activated dendritic cells, in all cohorts, suggesting a certain level of activation of cancer immunity in this RAD51 high breast cancer group. However, contrary to previous reports, RAD51 expression in breast cancer cell lines did not show any association between sensitivity to chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors. Neither for the breast cancer NAC cohort, RAD51 expression was not increased in the residual burden group, but conversely increase in RAD51expression was observed in pathological complete response group in some cohorts. Surprisingly, RAD51 was significantly associated with worse overall survival in all three large cohorts included in this analysis, and with worse disease-specific survival in two cohorts.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> RAD51 expression was significantly associated with worse survival, but did not with treatment-responsive, suggesting its usefulness as prognostic, but not predictive, biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a0a43f8-e799-4d93-bcf2-584e7b099fb8\/@x03B8ZKb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Homologous recombination,DNA repair,Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13651"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rongrong Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ankit Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshihisa Tokumaru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariko Asaoka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masanori Oshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Ishikawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuaki Takabe<\/i><\/presenter>.
