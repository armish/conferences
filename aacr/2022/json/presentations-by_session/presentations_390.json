[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b> Tumor-induced immunosuppression is a way in which cancers evade the host immune response. In recent years, a great effort has been made in designing immunotherapies that can boost the immune system response against cancer. However, not all tumors respond to these therapies. Therefore, there remains an unmet need for immunotherapies that are able to circumvent tumor-induced immunosuppression. Adenosine is an immunosuppressive metabolite which is overproduced in hypoxic tumor microenvironments and dampens T-cell anti-tumor immune responses. Adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) activation was shown to downregulate Notch1, a key regulator of T-cell functions, in CD8+ T-cells, leading to immunosuppression. Notch1 signaling appears to protect T-cells against immunosuppressive signals, as Notch1 overexpressing T-cells were shown to be resistant to tumor-induced immunosuppression mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), as well as adenosine. We hypothesize that rescuing Notch1 from downregulation will make T-cells resistant to tumor-induced immunosuppression. We applied several functional assays in primary CD8+ T-cells and tumor-derived organoids to study how Notch1 is regulated by A2AR and explore strategies to target this pathway for cancer immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Our results indicate that the ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, a negative regulator of T-cell functions, is responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of Notch1 in CD8+ T-cells. A2AR signaling leads to Notch1 downregulation by promoting Cbl-b-mediated Notch1 degradation. Inhibition of Cbl-b using small molecule compounds restores Notch1 and T-cell functions in CD8+ T-cells in the presence of adenosine, making them resistant to A2AR-mediated immunosuppression. Cbl-b inhibitors show anti-tumor activity in tumor-derived organoids from pre-clinical models and enhance immune-checkpoint immunotherapy, by promoting T-cells anti-cancer responses.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our work suggests that promoting Notch1 signaling by blocking Cbl-b-mediated degradation results in increased T-cell responses and resistance to immunosuppression. Targeting Cbl-b-Notch1 axis represents a promising novel strategy to boost anti-cancer T-cell responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5eb97dc7-c425-4db3-8731-01fc2fc11e39\/@C03B8ZGC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Notch,Cbl-b,Adenosine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17043"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Giulia Monticone<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fred Csibi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvana Leit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jermaine E.

In order to be effective, ICI requires neoantigen expression to drive anti-tumor T cell responses and numerous clinical studies have shown that high neoantigen load and tumor mutation burden correlate with improved patient response. Given the central importance of neoantigens in ICI response there is an urgent need for therapies that generate new neoantigens to drive novel anti-tumour cytotoxic T cell responses thereby increasing the number of patients achieving durable benefit. Grey Wolf are developing inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases (ERAP1 and ERAP2) to generate novel neoantigens. ERAP enzymes are members of the antigen presentation pathway, trimming a subset of peptides (15-20%) prior to their loading onto MHC Class I. Strikingly, reduced tumoral expression of ERAP1 in cancer correlates with a 50% increase in overall survival. Independent groups have also shown that ablation of ERAP1 generates neoantigens, causing tumor growth inhibition in various syngeneic models in combination with ICI. Grey Wolf have generated and profiled highly potent and selective ERAP1 inhibitors, leading to the nomination of the first-in-class ERAP1 inhibitor development candidate, GRWD5769. Extensive analysis of the immunopeptidomes of diverse cancer cell lines robustly show that ERAP1 inhibition consistently generates novel neoantigens <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Analysis of syngeneic tumor models treated with an orally administered ERAP1 inhibitor in combination with anti-PD-1 show that neoantigen generation produces a differentiated T cell response, including: 1) diversification of the tumoral T cell repertoire; 2) increased infiltration of T cells into tumors; and 3) synergistic upregulation of translationally relevant immune gene markers shown to correlate with response to anti-PD-1 in patients. In addition, elevations in immune mediated effects caused by ERAP1 inhibition in combination with anti-PD-1 correlate with tumor growth inhibition in mouse syngeneic studies. Importantly, ERAP1 inhibitors are well tolerated in mouse, rat, and non-human primates, which aligns with the observations that increases in T cell effects are tumor specific and not observed in peripheral tissue. Our investigation of the effects of ERAP1 inhibitors in mouse tumor models and <i>ex vivo<\/i> primary human T cell co-cultures have provided proof of mechanism and proof of principle biomarkers that will be used to explore the effects of GRWD5769 during Phase 1 clinical development in the second half of 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/468e88bc-2b30-4104-8692-ddc600e4466b\/@D03B8ZGD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Immuno-oncology,Antigen presentation,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17044"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Andrew Leishman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wayne Paes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Coulson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Pinggera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Sette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kate Anderton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicola Ternette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliet Morgan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Shiers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Quibell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Peter Ian Joyce<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Emerging evidence indicates potential clinical utility of IL-7 for immunotherapy of lymphopenia, oncology, and other indications. IL-7-based proteins that have been studied in humans show high propensity for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), including those that are neutralizing. Here we report an Fc-peptide fusion (MDK-703), which exhibits biological properties similar to IL-7 <i>in vitro<\/i> and when administered to non-human primates. The peptide sequence is unrelated to IL-7 and is predicted to be devoid of Class II (HLA-DR) restricted HLA ligands and putative T cell epitopes.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Peptide ligands were identified from phage libraries and further engineered to bind simultaneously to the R&#945; and &#947;c subunits of the human IL-7 receptor. Peptides were tested for agonist activity and screened in silico for potential HLA binding (EpiVax). The lead peptide sequence (corresponding to synthetic peptide MDK1472) was fused to a native IgG2 Fc-domain via a flexible linker (MDK-703) and evaluated for in vitro IL-7R agonist activity in human and cynomolgus macaque (CM) blood cells. Tolerability and PK\/PD were assessed in CM.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> MDK1472 bound to human IL-7R&#945; and &#947;c extracellular domains with KD&#8217;s of 300nM and 10nM, respectively. MDK-703 induced pSTAT5 and proliferation in human T-cells with maximum effects equivalent to that of IL-7. MDK-703 does not activate nor inhibit any other &#947;c family receptors at concentrations 100-fold greater than required for maximal IL-7R activation. Predicted immunogenicity, as determined by EpiMatrix Protein Score (-98.16) and EpiMatrix Cluster Scores (-3.54 to -30.28), was very low, indicating minimal potential for induction of T-cell-mediated anti-drug immune response. Single doses of MDK703 administered to CMs (1mg\/kg IV or SC) exhibited a half-life of ~46hr after IV dosing, with exposure after SC dosing similar to IV. MDK-703 caused an initial reduction (due to migration into tissues), followed by sustained elevation of peripheral lymphocytes and CD8 and CD4 T-cells, with no observed adverse effects.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> MDK-703 offers an attractive alternative to IL-7-based drug candidates currently in clinical development. The structural novelty of MDK-703 eliminates the risk of ADAs that neutralize endogenous IL-7. A first human trial of MDK703 is anticipated in 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8d38cf89-4e74-480b-8e10-9038e6f69377\/@D03B8ZGD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Immunotherapy,Immunostimulation,T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17045"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Angie I.

One such approach is RT in combination with high-dose recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2), which elicits anti-tumor immune responses by stimulating T-cell and NK cell populations. Although effective for some patients, the overall clinical benefit of high-dose recombinant IL-2 is limited by toxicity and the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) through signaling events mediated by IL2R&#913; (CD25).<br \/>In this study, we examined RT in combination with NL-201, a highly potent and stable CD25-independent IL-2 and IL-15 receptor agonist with enhanced affinity for IL2R&#914; and IL2R&#915;. Single-agent NL-201 was well-tolerated in mice, yielded tumoricidal activity, expanded peripheral T cells, and enhanced the infiltration of effector T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) into murine breast cancers. In combination with RT, NL-201 enhanced activation of the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, resulting in increased type I interferon (IFN) production in DCs and, consequently, greater tumor infiltration by T cells and more efficient priming of antigen-specific T cells by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The immune stimulatory mechanisms triggered by the NL-201 and RT combination resulted in superior tumor growth inhibition and survival benefit in both localized and metastatic murine breast cancers, including those spread to the central nervous system. Genetic knockout of STING in host cells abrogated the activity of the NL-201 and RT combination, thus confirming the crucial role of innate immune sensors in the combination treatment&#8217;s antitumor responses. Additionally, when combined with PD-1 antibodies, NL-201 significantly improved growth inhibition of metastatic breast cancers that were previously resistant to checkpoint blockade.<br \/>We demonstrated that the CD25-independent IL-2 and IL-15 receptor agonist, NL-201, in combination with RT is well-tolerated and elicits robust anti-tumor activity through both innate and adaptive responses, including in checkpoint resistant tumors and brain metastases. Furthermore, we identify a unique mechanism in which NL-201 synergizes with RT, likely via the direct activation of STING in DCs. Taken together, the results provided herein support further preclinical and clinical investigation of this novel combination regimen in both localized and metastatic settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea77c6a4-f1d6-4d5b-873c-6c689252927f\/@D03B8ZGD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Interleukin-2,Radiation,STING,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17046"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xuefeng Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Huntoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yifan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carl Walkey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Betty Y.

Eliminating the suppressive effects of tumor associated Tregs could, therefore, enhance antitumor activity of existing immunotherapies. CCR8 is a seven transmembrane G-coupled protein whose expression is highly upregulated on tumor associated Tregs in several types of tumors, but not on peripheral Tregs. The specific expression on tumor associated Tregs makes CCR8 an ideal target for treating cancers. The chemokine CCL1 interacts with the N terminus and second extracellular domain of CCR8. CCL1 produced by tumor associated macrophages can induce Tregs migration to the tumors. PSB114, a humanized anti-hCCR8 IgG1 antibody, was developed to block CCL1 mediated Tregs chemotaxis and deplete tumor associated CCR8-expressing Tregs. PSB114 was affinity matured by yeast display and glyco-modified to enhance its ADCC activity. PSB114 has high binding affinity for human CCR8 without significant binding to other membrane proteins, resulting in a favorable PK in hFcRn transgenic mice (T<sub>1\/2<\/sub><sup> <\/sup>&#62; 13 days). PSB114 is highly specific for the activated Tregs with low picomolar EC<sub>50<\/sub> of depletion activity. When tested in bioassays, PSB114 enhances T cell activation and TNF&#945; production from activated PBMCs. In a humanized mouse model, PSB114 preferentially depletes tumor infiltrating Tregs and increases NK and CD8 T cell infiltration within the tumor. Moreover, PBS114 significantly inhibited MC38 tumor growth in hCCR8 knock-in mice.

In contrast to wildtype IL2, IL2v does not bind to CD25 (IL2Ra) and, therefore, the preferential targeting of T regulatory cells (Tregs) and endothelial cells through CD25 is abolished. The PD-1 antibody, having ca. 50-fold higher affinity than IL2v, dictates the preferential cis-delivery of IL2v to PD-1 positive T cells, such as antigen-experienced tumor-reactive T cells. In addition, due to the reduced expression levels of PD-1 on Tregs compared to CD8 and conventional T cells, PD1-IL2v preferentially binds to the latter in vitro and ex vivo, rescuing them from Treg-mediated suppression. To assess the effects of the cis-delivery of IL2v to PD-1+ T cells in vivo, we applied subcutaneous B16F10-OVA and Panc02-H7-Fluc tumor models in syngeneic mice. PD1-IL2v lead to significantly improved survival of the B16F10-OVA tumor bearing and tumor regression in the Panc02-H7-Fluc tumor bearing mice. The OVA-specific CD8 T cells expressed the highest amount of PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment, and PD1-IL2v not only increased the total number of CD8 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), but, more importantly, it expanded the OVA-specific T cells. The recently discovered PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> stem-like or resource T cells responsible for the proliferative burst following anti-PD-1 therapy, correlate with clinical responses and better prognosis. However, stem-like T cells ultimately differentiate into terminally exhausted T cells resulting in relapses and tumor growth. Here, we show that PD1-IL2v targets OVA-specific stem-like T cells, and leads to their expansion and differentiation into a unique population of effector CD8 T cells, so-called &#8220;fresh and better effectors&#8221;. These cells have a distinct phenotypic and molecular signature in addition to diverse TCR clonality in comparison to the terminally exhausted CD8 TILs generated by anti-PD1 therapy alone or in combination with a non-cis targeted FAP-IL2v immunocytokine. Thus, PD1-IL2v is a differentiated immune cell-targeted IL2v, which promotes an effective and long-term anti-tumor immune-response by delivering IL-2v to PD-1+ tumor-specific T cells, like stem-like T cells, and by generating a distinct effector T cell population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd2107be-d0a7-420f-9d03-966b780a2708\/@D03B8ZGD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Immuno-oncology,T lymphocytes,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17049"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Karagianni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eleni Maria Varypataki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valeria Nicolini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Münz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pablo Umana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Klein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Codarri Deak<\/i><\/presenter>.

They have demonstrated combination activity with PD-(L)1 blockade to potentially expand the benefit to patients with unresponsive tumors. Despite its potential, the toxicity of interferon alpha has limited its clinical use. Here we applied CytomX proprietary Probody&#174; Therapeutics (Pb-Tx) technology to create a conditionally active IFN-&#945;2b (Pb-IFN-&#945;2b) with minimal activity in its prodrug form. The prodrug is activated in the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to preferential activity in the TME but not in healthy tissues. Pb-IFN-&#945;2b demonstrated an enhanced tolerability profile compared to standard IFN therapy without compromising its antitumor effects. The Pb-Tx platform technology attenuates activity of a molecule by blocking its active regions through affinity or steric interference. Such blockade, termed masking, is reversed upon proteolytic cleavage of a substrate-containing linker between the molecule and the mask by tumor associated proteases. Pb-IFN molecules were engineered with a dual masking approach combining the effects of steric inhibition by Fc fusion and affinity interference by a peptide mask. Pb-IFN-&#945;2b demonstrated significant reduction (1000-fold or more) of its specific activity in vitro, including antiproliferative effects and immune cell activation. Treatment with tumor-associated proteases or exposure to viable tumor tissues fully restored its activity. Activated but not masked Pb-IFN-&#945;2b induced a gene expression profile consistent with interferon signaling in primary human immune cells. In vitro studies with dissociated human tumors demonstrated the ability of Pb-IFN to activate tumor immune infiltrate, which could be further enhanced by concomitant PD-L1 blockade. Antitumor activity of the Pb-IFN-&#945;2b in xenograft studies is equal to or greater than Peg-IFN-&#945;2b. Pb-IFN-&#945;2b demonstrated significant antitumor activity in syngeneic mouse tumor models without evidence of toxicity. Consistent with in vitro observations, this anti-tumor activity was further enhanced by PD-(L)1 blockade. Toxicology studies performed in hamsters demonstrated enhanced tolerability of the molecule compared to its unmasked control. Pb-IFN-&#945;2b did not cause hematological changes or body weight loss associated with unmasked interferon. In cynomolgus monkey Pb-IFN-&#945;2b demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics, extended half-life, and was well tolerated at doses up to 15 mg\/kg. Pb-IFN-&#945;2b shows improved tolerability and antitumor activity in preclinical studies compared to traditional IFN treatment. These data support Probody cytokine therapeutics as a promising addition to current immunotherapy regimens, potentially expanding their benefits to patients with typically unresponsive tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c779bfc2-2096-420f-a571-4489b66d9eff\/@D03B8ZGD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Tumor microenvironment,Immunocytokines,Prodrugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17050"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexey Berezhnoy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Lapuyade<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carol LePage<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael B.

However, IL-12 shows poor pharmacokinetics and intolerable toxicities due to unspecific distribution. Herein, we present pH-sensitive polymeric micelles loading IL-12 (IL-12\/m) that release fully active IL-12 after sensing intratumoral pH to safely potentiate immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: IL-12\/m with 40 nm in diameter were prepared by self-assembly in phosphate buffer. The IL-12 release was tested at different pH. The stimulation of IFN-&#947; release from IL-12 and IL-12\/m was studied in mouse splenocytes. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and antitumor activity were studied in immunosuppressed (B16F10 and 4T1) mouse tumor models (staged &#8805; 200 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) and in a lung metastasis model (4T1). The safety of IL-12 was evaluated by tracing levels of cytokines and blood markers of toxicity.<br \/>Results: IL-12\/m selectively activated at intratumoral pH 6.5, releasing more than 80% of IL-12 in 24 h. While IL-12\/m did not induce IFN-&#947; production in splenocytes, the released IL-12 showed similar activity to native IL-12. In mice, IL-12\/m prolonged blood circulation with minimal leakage, yielding a 3-fold longer half-life than IL-12. Moreover, the accumulation in tumor for IL-12\/m (7.5%ID\/g of tumor) was 3-fold higher compared that of free IL-12, with more than 90% of IL-12\/m being activated. The tumors treated with IL-12\/m showed 2-3-fold higher levels of IFN-&#947;, IL-6 and TNF-&#945; than those treated with IL-12, whereas anti-inflammatory IL-10 was 2-fold lower for IL-12\/m. In blood and organs, IL-12\/m lowered the cytokine levels compared to IL-12. Also, IL-12\/m avoided the tachyphylaxis of IL-12 without peak effects of IFN-&#947;, and the blood markers of toxicity, <i>i.e.<\/i>, BUN, ALT and AST, remained close to control levels, supporting the tumor selective activation of IL-12\/m. IL-12\/m was efficacious in the B16F10 tumor model (10 &#181;g iv 3 injections every 4 days) as monotherapy, and in combination with anti-PD-1 (10 mg\/kg IP 3 injections every 4 days), which led to 6 of 10 complete regressions (CR). IL-12\/m was also effective at 1 &#181;g (5 injections every 2 days) against 4T1 tumors. IL-12\/m increase the number and activation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and NK cells in tumors. The combination of IL-12\/m (10 &#181;g iv 3 injections every 4 days) with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 (both 10 mg\/kg IP 3 injections every 4 days) achieve complete CR in a spontaneous model of lung metastasis. Responders showed immunological memory after being rechallenged with fresh tumor cells.<br \/>Conclusions: IL-12\/m, a pH-activated polymeric micelle loading IL-12, masked the activity of IL-12 in healthy tissues, while it unleashed full potency of IL-12 in tumors, improving tolerability and efficacy. IL-12\/m presented greater antitumor activity than IL-12 as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6bef565f-1002-41d5-a794-6834a39f9148\/@D03B8ZGD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-12,Nanoparticle,Immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17051"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Horacio Cabral<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pengwen Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuhiko Kakimi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazunori Kataoka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takuya Miyazaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koji Nagaoka<\/i><\/presenter>.

In non-vaccinated mice, rPV mediates antitumor efficacy in a replication-dependent manner via engaging innate inflammation and antitumor T cells. Accordingly, it was anticipated that pre-existing immunity to rPV impedes antitumor therapy.<br \/>Strikingly, despite curtailing intratumor viral replication, prior polio vaccination in mice substantially bolstered the antitumor efficacy of rPV relative to mice vaccinated with a control antigen (KLH). Intratumor recall responses induced by polio and tetanus antigens also delayed tumor growth. Recall antigen therapy was associated with marked intratumor influx of eosinophils, PD1 and Granzyme B expressing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), conventional CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, and increased expression of IFN-&#947;, TNF, and Granzyme B in tumor infiltrating T cells. The antitumor efficacy of polio recall antigen was mediated by CD4+ T cells, partially depended upon both CD8+ T cells and eosinophils, and was independent of B cells. Intratumor polio and tetanus recall antigen therapy bolstered the antitumor function of tumor-specific OT-I CD8+ T cells, indicating that intratumor CD4+ T cell recall provides help to antitumor CD8+ T cells. Recall antigen therapy complemented antitumor effects of immune checkpoint blockade and innate stimulating immunotherapy.<br \/>This work reveals that childhood vaccine-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells hold cancer immunotherapy potential and represent a novel mechanism to simultaneously engage both type I and II antitumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a3303ba-407f-4238-b3ea-3fcf767f9273\/@D03B8ZGD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunostimulation,T cell,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17052"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Clavon Brown<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary P.

The generation of adenosine from adenosine monophosphate (AMP) requires the activity of a cell surface ecto-5&#8217;-nucleotidase, CD73, expressed on the surface of various cell types including immune cells. CD73 overexpression is observed in many tumor types and correlates with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Given the essential role of CD73 in generating adenosine, inhibition of CD73 is a promising therapeutic strategy. Recent clinical proof of concept data demonstrated a significant improvement in progression free survival for non-small cell lung cancer patients upon targeting CD73 with the oleclumab anti-CD73 antibody in combination with anti-PDL1, relative to anti-PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment alone.We developed ORIC-533, a potent, orally bioavailable, AMP-competitive, small molecule inhibitor of CD73, that is highly selective for CD73 and exhibits picomolar potency in biochemical assays, completely blocking adenosine production from AMP. In ex vivo assays, ORIC-533 displayed greater potency in restoring immunosuppressed CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation compared to oleclumab, as well as greater potency versus small molecule inhibitors of CD73 and the adenosine receptor. In multiple myeloma (MM) patients, elevated adenosine levels in the bone marrow (BM) niche correlate with progression of multiple myeloma through a CD73-mediated pathway. Moreover, we recently reported a functional role of CD73 signaling in BM of MM patients, indicating that CD73 inhibition may represent a unique vulnerability and treatment strategy for MM (Ray et al., abstract #2675, ASH 2021).<br \/>We tested the impact of CD73 inhibition in bone marrow aspirates from patients with relapsed or refractory MM, using an autologous ex vivo assay system comprised of the multiple myeloma BM microenvironment. CD73 inhibition stimulated the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T cell activation in the context of the MM BM milieu. Moreover, ORIC CD73 inhibitor as a single agent overcame immune suppression and triggered significant lysis and cell death of multiple myeloma cells by autologous T-cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the ORIC CD73 inhibitor potently inhibits the adenosine pathway, which restores anti-tumor immunity and therefore holds potential for patients with MM. Based upon these data, ORIC-533 is being studied as a single agent in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b37bd7f-f82e-4bb7-99af-a21d26f1a611\/@E03B8ZGE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,Multiple myeloma,Immunomodulation,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17054"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melissa R.

Tumor cells can evolve to avoid immune recognition through inactivating the STING pathway by diverse mechanisms, indicating that it is important to generating tumor-specific immunity. However, the clinical activity of STING agonists given by intratumoral (IT) administration has not compared well to preclinical studies. The scientific hypothesis supporting these first clinical studies is that localized CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell priming would have activity against distal non-injected tumors, but findings that tumors in advanced malignancies have unique antigenic repertoires suggests that this approach may have limited activity against distal tumors. Global innate activation in metastases may therefore be necessary to prime a broadly active CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell population targeting diverse antigens, in addition having the benefit of reversing the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). However, ubiquitous expression of STING presents a significant challenge to achieving a therapeutic index with systemic delivery of direct STING agonists. Selective activation of the STING pathway may be achieved through targeted inhibition of TREX1, a cytosolic DNA exonuclease that modulates cGAS\/STING signaling. Expression of TREX1, in contrast to STING, is increased in tumor cells due to elevated levels of cytosolic DNA resulting from genetic instability, DNA repair mutation, inflammatory mediators or DNA-modifying anti-cancer therapies. These observations provide the principal scientific rationale to selectively activate the STING pathway in metastatic disease through targeted inhibition of TREX1. Utilizing published TREX1 X-ray crystal structures to guide medicinal chemistry, we discovered small molecule inhibitors of TREX1 and transformed these molecules from &#62;100 &#181;M leads into a series with drug-like physicochemical properties and picomolar potency against both human and mouse TREX1. We evaluated the activity of lead molecules in cell-based assays, in which TREX1 inhibition enhanced cGAS\/STING signaling, and advanced molecules with desired pharmacokinetic profiles to mouse tumor studies. We observed significant anti-tumor activity in mice with CT26 tumors given a combined therapy of low dose doxorubicin to induce dsDNA breaks and increase TME TREX1 expression along with lead series TREX1 molecule inhibitors. Recognizing that TREX1 is a DNA repair enzyme, we also showed that TREX1 inhibitors were cytotoxic in DNA repair deficient human tumor cell lines, informing advancement of this new class of STING therapeutics as a clinical approach to both activate the cGAS\/STING pathway to initiate immune recognition, as well as to inhibit DNA repair orthogonal to existing tumor-driver DNA repair mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/142eed27-838e-43e4-802a-57df94e36d66\/@E03B8ZGE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Immuno-oncology,DNA damage response,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17056"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Brian Francica<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dara Burdette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Clark<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamie Cope<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Freund<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anja Holtz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peppi Prasit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chan Whiting<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Thomas W.

An attractive next-generation approach to 4-1BB agonistic therapeutics are multi-functional biologics that conditionally activate 4-1BB only in the tumor microenvironment, thereby localizing activity and minimizing toxicity. Furthermore, there is a strong rationale to combine 4-1BB agonism with checkpoint inhibition. Opal is a novel multi-specific construct that, in a single molecule, combines (i) a single-chain, trimeric 4-1BB ligand (sc4-1BBL); (ii) an engineered variant of the PD1 extracellular domain (ECD) with affinity-enhancing mutations (mutPD1); and (iii) a serum half-life extension domain. By fusing sc4-1BBL and mutPD1, 4-1BB agonism became conditional on the presence of PDL1 or PDL2. By using the mutPD1 ECD rather than an anti-PDL1 antibody, the specificity of Opal is expanded to PDL2-expressing cancer cells with low to undetectable levels of PDL1. The use of trimeric 4-1BBL is expected to optimally agonize the 4-1BB receptor by engaging its natural binding site. Opal omits a functional Fc gamma domain to avoid the hepatic toxicities associated with urelumab. Opal properties were characterized using biophysical and cellular assays. We showed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy that compared to wildtype (wt) PD1, mutPD1 had affinities for PDL1 and PDL2 that were enhanced by &#62;2000-fold and &#62;200-fold, respectively. In a competition ELISA assay, Opal effectively blocked wt PD1 from binding to PDL1 and PDL2. PDL1\/2-conditional activation of 4-1BB was shown in two independent assays. First, using 4-1BB reporter cells, 4-1BB activity was enhanced &#62;5x when Opal was pre-complexed with recombinant PDL1-Fc. Second, when activated PBMCs were co-cultured in the presence of HEK293T-PDL1 or -PDL2 cells with serial dilutions of Opal, induction of IFN&#947; secretion was detectable only in the presence of PDL1 or PDL2. Importantly, variants of Opal with abrogated PD1 or 4-1BBL domains failed to trigger IFN&#947; production. To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of Opal in vivo, MC38 tumor cells expressing human PDL1 were inoculated in the flanks of mice expressing human 4-1BB. When tumor-bearing mice were treated IP with Opal at 1 mg\/kg, 7\/10 mice exhibited durable cures without significant body weight loss. Taken together, the preclinical data suggests that Opal may exhibit single-agent activity in solid tumors by conditionally activating effector cells in the tumor microenvironment via 4-1BB agonism while concurrently blocking the PD1\/PDL1\/PDL2 axis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3245ac6e-cd2d-4213-bcbc-96d272ac3138\/@E03B8ZGE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Fusion proteins,T cell,Immunostimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17058"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Naveen K.

Both the CD19-specific T cell-engaging bispecific antibody blinatumomab and various autologous CAR-T cell therapies have exhibited robust clinical activity in relapsed\/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). While CAR-T cell therapies show high complete response rates, bispecific antibodies have room for improvement. Both therapies, however, fail in patients where tumor cells escape selective pressure by expressing very low or undetectable levels of the CD19 antigen.We developed a novel CD19\/CD3-bispecific antibody construct called CLN-978. Like blinatumomab, CLN-978 has tandemly arranged CD19- and CD3-specific single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments. Uniquely, a single-domain antibody specific for serum albumin was N-terminally fused to enable a prolonged serum half-life, eliminating the need for continuous IV infusion. CLN-978 is composed of novel humanized CD19-, CD3- and albumin-binding elements that are cross-reactive with non-human primate (NHP) orthologs and lacks a hexahistidine tag. It is produced at g\/L levels in CHO cells and enables protein A affinity purification. CLN-978 has a 100-fold higher binding affinity for CD19 than blinatumomab. Side-by-side comparison with blinatumomab showed that the higher CD19 binding affinity translates into superior T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (TDCC) of CLN-978 with both target cell lines expressing high or very low levels of CD19. Superior efficacy was similarly observed in xenotransplant mouse tumor models. Preclinical studies in primates are in progress assessing safety, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of CLN-978 administered either through intravenous or subcutaneous delivery. CLN-978 has the potential to have superior TDCC against cells expressing very low levels of CD19 as are selected following treatment with CD19-directed therapies. This may translate into higher response rates and longer response duration in ALL and NHL patients expressing normal and very low levels of CD19 on malignant B cells. The cross-reactivity of CLN-978 to the NHP orthologs of CD19, CD3 and albumin enables assessment of depletion of normal B cells, strategies to mitigate cytokine release, PK and PD properties, and exploration of dosing routes. CLN-978 holds promise as a CD19-targeted therapeutic that can be easily and conveniently administered to patients with diverse B cell malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f37f1b96-94f2-42fc-86a0-8c48889d48d6\/@E03B8ZGE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD19,T cell engager,Immunostimulation,Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17059"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patrick A.

In lymphoid malignancies, the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells and bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) has achieved remarkable success. However, such immunotherapeutic strategies are not yet established for AML, likely due to a dearth of appropriate targets. The fms like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)\/CD135 surface receptor is expressed on AML cells in the large majority of AML patients and constitutes a highly selective target antigen for immunotherapy, as expression on healthy tissues is limited to low levels on dendritic cells, monocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells. We report here on the development of CLN-049, a bispecific humanized antibody that binds to FLT3 on leukemic cells and the CD3 epsilon subunit of the T cell receptor complex on T cells. CLN-049 recognizes the membrane proximal domain of FLT3 and has a silenced Fc gamma 1 domain, with anti-CD3 single chain variable fragments (scFv) fused to the C-termini of the heavy chains. While FLT3 kinase inhibitors are limited to treatment of patients with specific intracellular FLT3 mutations, CLN-049 recognizes the extracellular domain of FLT3 and would therefore be more broadly applicable in AML therapy. CLN-049 showed low-nanomolar binding to both FLT3-expressing and CD3-expressing cells. The antibody induced target-dependent activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as corresponding cytokine production by T cells only when co-cultured with FLT3+ AML cells. Human AML cell lines expressing a broad range of surface levels of FLT3 were efficiently lysed upon treatment with sub-nanomolar concentrations of CLN-049 when co-cultured with heterologous PBMCs, regardless of the expression level or mutational status of FLT3. Intriguingly, FLT3-expressing hematopoietic progenitor cells and dendritic cells were not found to be sensitive to CLN-049 killing. The in vitro lysis of leukemic cells by CLN-049 was not affected by supraphysiological levels of soluble FLT3 or FLT3 ligand. In mouse xenograft studies, CLN-049 was highly active against the MOLM-13 human AML model. In these studies, CLN-049 demonstrated significant dose-dependent activity as measured by survival as well as reduction of AML cells in the blood. In summary, CLN-049 is a promising FLT3-targeted T cell engaging antibody construct expected to have robust anti-tumor activity in the clinic against AML. CLN-049 is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with relapsed\/refractory AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a8fad36-6f2f-4f15-b39d-279f6cb5d899\/@E03B8ZGE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"FLT3,Bispecific antibody,T cell engager,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17060"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kristan Meetze<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naveen K.

It has been documented that genomic instability and mitotic stress in malignant cells can lead to aberrant cytosolic DNA accumulation and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. A key negative regulator of cytosolic DNA is the DNA exonuclease TREX1. TREX1 assists in removing DNA from the cytosol, in turn reducing cGAS-STING mediated type I IFN induction. Not surprisingly, TREX1 is overexpressed in several tumor types when compared to normal tissue. The functional importance of TREX1 in cytoplasmic nucleic acid surveillance is evidenced by inactivating TREX1 mutations having an association with Type I inteferonopathies such as Aicardi-Gouti&#232;res syndrome and SLE. Specifically, most of these mutations impact the enzymatic function of TREX1, underscoring the importance of its exonuclease function. To directly assess TREX1 function in cancer, we inactivated TREX1 in a panel of tumor cell lines. Loss of TREX1 resulted in reduced proliferation and increased expression of the Type I IFN-stimulated gene CXCL10. This finding was validated with CRISPR knockout of TREX1, which also led to the activation of IRF3 and a Type I IFN associated gene signature. To characterize the role of TREX1 function in curbing anti-tumor immunity in vivo, we inactivated Trex1 in the murine syngeneic B16F10 melanoma model. TREX1 knockout together with PD1 blockade resulted in slower tumor growth when compared to PD1 blockade alone. This was accompanied by an increase in CD8+ T and NK cell infiltration in tumors. In addition, gene expression profiling of whole tumors revealed that TREX1 loss resulted in increased type I IFN signaling within the tumor microenvironment. In summary, our data strongly suggest a critical role for TREX1 in suppressing anti-tumor immunity and indicate it would be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/863d6fc5-f27d-4fc5-90ff-f73331a8dad8\/@E03B8ZGE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Antitumor effect,Immunostimulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17061"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haritha Mathsyaraja<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Wolf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chari Cortez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Kashishian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alison Karst<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madelyn Cueva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathleen S.

However, therapeutic approaches utilizing these cytokines have suffered from low tolerability, fast clearance, and limited therapeutic window due to extensive activity on peripheral lymphocytes. Conversely, higher drug concentration and prolonged exposure are desirable to allow lymphocyte activation and proliferation at the tumor site, but this can be difficult to achieve due to dose-limiting toxicities associated with this axis. IL15 functions as a stabilized heterodimeric complex with membrane-bound IL15R&#945; on the surface of monocytes and DCs, which is presented in trans to lymphocytes expressing IL2R&#946;\/&#947;c. We hypothesized that we could selectively target tumor-reactive TILs by combining a reduced potency IL15\/IL15R&#945; heterocomplex with an immune checkpoint(CP)-targeting arm to bias binding and activation to CP-positive TILs, potentially improving therapeutic index. Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) was chosen as the CP targeting-arm due to its frequent co-expression with PD1, bias to CD8+ T cells, ability to easily combine with anti-PD1 agents, and recent promising results with anti-LAG3 agents in the clinic.<br \/>First, potency-reduced IL15\/IL15R&#945; were created by engineering amino acid substitutions in IL15 - at the IL2R&#946;\/&#947;c interface - that reduced in vitro potency by at least 1000-fold. We then designed LAG3 x IL15 fusion proteins containing single-chain IL15\/IL15R&#945; and LAG3-targeting arms attached to a heterodimeric-Fc region, relying on targeting avidity to recover potency on LAG3+ cells. In vitro proliferation of lymphocytes in human PBMCs, stimulated with sub-optimal concentrations of anti-CD3 to induce LAG3 expression, was monitored by CFSE dilution or by counting Ki67+ cells after incubation with LAG3 x IL15 for 4 days. In vivo activity was evaluated using humanized mouse models by measuring the extent of human leukocyte expansion. Lead LAG3 x IL15 were evaluated for pharmacodynamic activity, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability in non-human primates.<br \/>LAG3 x IL15 showed &#62;500-fold selectivity compared to a non-targeted IL15 in an in vitro proliferation assay of lymphocytes stimulated for induced LAG3 expression. In vitro potency was greatest on effector memory CD8 T cells. LAG3 x IL15 were 3-fold more potent on CD8 T cells compared to CD4 T cells and had very weak activity on NK cells, consistent with minimal LAG3 expression on this population. In mouse models, treatment with LAG3 x IL15 promoted significantly increased numbers of T cells. Moreover, LAG3 x IL15 combined productively with anti-PD1 to promote additional T cell expansion. These results demonstrate that LAG3 x IL15 show a promising profile of selective IL15 delivery to TIL with minimal peripheral activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/43cfe6b9-b808-4a02-950c-1e6a92e1fe82\/@E03B8ZGE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Immune checkpoint,Interleukin-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17064"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew J.

Inhibition of PARP in BRCA-mutant cancers has been a clinically approved therapy for several years. While the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, has been approved for the treatment of BRCA-mutant breast and ovarian cancers, it has not been used in other cancers because its mechanism of action relies on synthetic lethality. We have found that olaparib may also have use in other cancers due to its ability to modulate the immune system directly. Specifically, we have found that olaparib is able to increase the proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity of T cells in vitro and reduce tumor growth in vivo at low doses. Recent papers have proposed that olaparib is able to enhance T cell function through the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway by enhancing antigen presenting cell activity and resulting in more granzyme B expression and enhanced tumor killing. Using purified T cells from both wild type and STING knockout mice, we have shown that olaparib can also cause an increase in granzyme B and perforin expression, an increase in T cell proliferation, and enhanced tumor cell killing in a STING-independent manner. Because PARP is an NAD-consuming enzyme, we examined the role of NAD+ in the activation T cells and the production of granzyme B and perforin. By using an inhibitor of NAD+ recycling, FK866, we show that T cells have reduced NAD+ levels, reduced granzyme B and perforin expression, and even fail to activate in the presence of CD3 and CD28 when NAD+ is limited; however, adding olaparib to these cells rescues the effects of FK866 and allows proliferation and granzyme B production. In vivo we can see that even at olaparib doses that are significantly below those which induce synthetic lethality of tumor cells, olaparib is able to inhibit tumor growth in models of both colorectal and breast cancer. This suggests that olaparib can modulate the activity of T cells directly and has implications for enhancing the anti-tumor activity of these cells both alone and in combination with other forms of immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/52335e85-97f4-48be-b26e-805a227e6bff\/@E03B8ZGE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Immunotherapy,Cytotoxic T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17065"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew J.

However, in retrospective clinical studies, the survival benefit associated with metformin use in cancer patients is often modest. Consequently, the design and conduct of sufficiently powered prospective clinical trials aimed at exploring this drug&#8217;s anti-tumor potential are hampered by the absence of predictive biomarkers. Testing the notion that specific patient characteristics such as obesity may impact the relative potency of metformin&#8217;s effects on lung cancer survival, we analyzed the patient outcomes of 756 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases with early- (stage I\/II, n = 490) or late-stage disease (stage III\/IV, n = 266) that either did or did not use metformin (n = 121 and 635, respectively) while not receiving neoadjuvant therapy. We found that metformin use is associated with improved overall and recurrence free survival only in overweight and obese patients defined by a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>. Corroborative findings obtained from immunocompetent mouse lung cancer models aligned with these observations. In these studies, despite supporting accelerated growth of both primary and metastatic tumors compared to their normal weight counterparts, animals subjected to diet induced obesity (DIO) experienced significantly reduced tumor development upon metformin treatment. In contrast, the drug had little-to-no effect on tumor burden in normal weight controls. Furthermore, while flow cytometric evaluation of obese mouse-derived tumors identified several previously described mediators of immune dysfunction previously described in animals with DIO (e.g., widespread up-regulation of the immune checkpoint factors PD-1 and Lag3, elevated suppressor cell proportions and activity), metformin treatment was associated with their reversal specifically in the tumors of obese mice. Interestingly, the drug had little effect on the tumor immune contexture of normal weight mice, and gene expression analysis failed to reveal considerable alterations in canonical cancer pathways. Thus, our preclinical and clinical studies suggest that the anti-diabetic drug metformin has an anti-cancer effect in NSCLC that is restricted to overweight individuals and reflects its potential to direct favorable, context-specific immune reprogramming. This work also provides the rationale for using high BMI as a predictive biomarker of the anti-cancer effect of metformin in lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a262ecaf-c25b-45a1-9223-64ba3ff4e9f5\/@E03B8ZGE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metformin,Obesity,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17066"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joseph Barbi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Randall J.
