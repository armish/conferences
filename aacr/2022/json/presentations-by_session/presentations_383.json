[{"Abstract":"Despite the significant success of immunotherapy, more than 40% of cancer patients remain unresponsive or exhibit an insufficient response. Well-designed combinations of targeted therapy and immunotherapy have the potential to increase effectiveness of cancer treatment and overcome the absence of response to either therapy alone. Since targeted therapies that enhance tumor antigenicity can enhance the effectiveness of immune based therapies, we have built a compendium of <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> assays to evaluate the effect of multiple immunogenic drugs. In these assays, we use the preclinical melanoma cell line B16-F10 model as it is highly metastatic and responds poorly to immunotherapy alone. The tumor suppressor p53 is a key target both in terms of targeted therapy owing to its role in halting tumor progression as well as in combination with immunotherapy, since p53 has varied roles in immune modulation. APR-246 can activate p53 and elicit some p53-independent effects in various tumor models predominantly through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress. Since these cellular stressors (including p53) have been shown to be capable of rendering tumor cells immunogenic, we hypothesized that APR-246 may also increase the antigenicity of tumor cells. Indeed, we observed that treatment of B16 cells with APR-246 increases their MHC expression. Additionally, in our <i>in vitro<\/i> co-culture assays, cells treated with APR-246 were able to activate antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells either directly or via CD11c<sup>+ <\/sup>cells. We also observed that mice immunized with APR-246-treated B16 cells and then implanted with healthy untreated melanoma cells, were able to confer prolonged tumor free survival. Taken together, we believe that APR-246 has the potential to make for a strong combination with immunomodulatory therapies owing to its immunogenic potential. Based on these observations, we rationally designed a combination treatment regimen that would further enhance the immunogenic effects elicited by APR-246 on tumor cells. The triple combination of APR-246 with the TLR4 agonist, Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and the anti-CD40 antibody significantly reduced the growth of B16 tumor in C57BL\/6J<i> <\/i>mice. Strikingly, using CRISPR generated B16 p53 KO cells, we have discovered that these effects of APR-246 exist even in the absence of p53, albeit slightly reduced. Therefore, our results indicate that combination of APR-246 with immunomodulatory agents may be effective in treating cancers irrespective of their genetic status of p53. Our finding suggests that drugs with immunogenic potential, in addition to their original therapeutic indication, such as APR-246 are good candidates for the improvement of various clinically relevant immune modulatory therapies.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy has produced unprecedented, durable control suggestive of Cu even in bulky Cs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several insights, including donor-derived Cs in solid organ transplant recipients decades after Cu of donors&#8217; Cs, the notion that Natural Killer (NK) cell action is governed by a ratio to its target cells (given the finite perforin\/granzyme B), &#38; Tu Infiltrating Lymphocytes experience all suggest to us that ICI-induced Cu might emerge if Eq is restored between immunity (T-\/NK cells) &#38; minimal TR. Such drastic C control requires truncal immunogenic mutation(s), an inducible cell death machinery in C cells &#38; functional immunity, collectively termed here as immune-prone (IP) Cs. We hypothesized that M results in Cu ONLY in IP Cs by debulking (DB) Tu load to a TR, restoring Eq.<br \/>We retrieved the progression-free survival plateau (PFS-p), a Cu surrogate, from series reporting on &#62;40 patients in multiple Cs\/variable IP strata (reflected by mutation burden). We juxtaposed the PFS-p for ICI monotherapy along curative M &#38; provided the mutational landscape from the literature. PFS-p for ICI &#38; M seem comparable &#38; may be superior in the most IP C (melanoma) since ICI has dual impact; DBs &#38; enhances immunity.<table class=\"AbstractTable\"

Emerging evidence indicates that LIF biology is hijacked by some tumors to promote immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages, cancer initiating cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In patients treated with anti-PD-1 \/ anti-PD-L1 antibodies (IO), baseline high LIF expression correlated with poor outcome (Loriot et al. 2021). In preclinical models, LIF blockade has separately been reported to sensitize tumors to IO and to chemotherapy (chemo), but the impact of LIF blockade on chemo\/IO combination activity is unknown. We therefore evaluated the hypothesis that LIF blockade sensitizes tumors to chemo\/IO combinations. AZD0171 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to LIF and prevents signaling through LIF receptor. A murine surrogate of AZD0171 (mAZD0171) was generated and tested <i>in vivo<\/i> using three syngeneic murine cancer models, and AZD0171 was tested in patient derived xenograft models. Monotherapy mAZD0171 induced tumor gene expression changes consistent with its proposed mechanism of action in the syngeneic CT26 colon tumor model; including elevated CD8 attracting chemokines (CXCL9\/10), cDC1 transcription factor (Batf3) and reduced stem cell (CD44), EMT (CY61) and hypoxic \/ angiogenic signatures, including CXCL12. Flow cytometry analysis highlighted changes consistent with suppressive macrophage re-education (reduced CD206 \/ elevated MHCII). mAZD0171 sensitized mouse tumors to both IO and chemo. mAZD0171 + anti-PD-L1 treatment reversed CD8 T cell exclusion in the D2A1-m2 model; a LIF expressing cancer associated fibroblast rich, anti-PD-L1 resistant mouse mammary tumor syngeneic model (Jungwirth et al. 2018). mAZD0171 + anti-PD-L1 treatment further inhibited D2A1-m2 growth versus (vs) anti-PD-L1 treatment alone. In a non-small cell lung carcinoma patient derived xenograft model, AZD0171 improved the tumor growth inhibitory effect of Carboplatin + Paclitaxel. The triplet combination of mAZD0171 plus chemo and IO had the most marked impact on both tumor microenvironment and tumor growth. mAZD0171 addition to oxaliplatin (OHP) or Docetaxel (DTX) chemotherapy plus anti-PD-L1 significantly elevated CD8 abundance and granzyme B expression in MC38 colon tumors. mAZD0171 + anti-PD-L1 + OHP or DTX improved inhibition of MC38 tumor growth (63% for OHP triplet vs 34% for anti-PD-L1 + OHP; 49% for DTX triplet vs 36% for anti-PD-L1 + DTX) and extended median survival times (P&#60;0.05 vs anti-PD-L1+OHP\/DTX). Together these data support the hypothesis that AZD0171 has the potential to sensitize solid tumors to chemotherapy\/IO combinations. The safety and activity of AZD0171 is currently being assessed in a Ph2 clinical trial in combination with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) and chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer (NCT04999969).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03b5cc8e-7aa3-4a23-8ab3-24f0a4183813\/@z03B8ZG7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunotherapy,Chemotherapy,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16868"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juliana Candido<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gozde Kar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bairu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Opoku-Ansah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amit Grover<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth A.

UTUC present less tumor mutational burden and low tumor immune infiltrate<sup> <\/sup>compared to bladder cancer. Despite this they are treated with the same protocol than bladder cancer with more than 50% of relapses justifying the need of new therapeutic options. To improve patient care, we suggest stimulating the immune system by platinum-based chemotherapies (Cisplatin-Gemcitabine (CisGem) or Carboplatin-Gemcitabine (CarboGem)) in order to potentiate the effect of an anti-PD-L1, the Durvalumab. We launched a phase II clinical trial called &#8220;iNDUCT&#8221; which studies these combinations in UTUC patients. In parallel, we conduct an <i>in vitro<\/i> project that aims to determine if chemotherapies could transform cold tumor into a hot tumor, and if so by which mechanisms? Using UTUC cell lines (UM-UC-14,UCC03,UCC17,UCC14,UCC47) we have evaluated the cytotoxicity effects of the chemotherapies combinations in 2D and 3D cell cultures. We have assessed their potential (i) to induce DNA damage using image cytometry, (ii) to induce PD-L1 expression using flow cytometry, (iii) to induce immune cell death using ELISA kits, (iv) to activate the cGAS\/STING pathway using qPCR and Western-Blot, and finally (v) to attract immune cells by using heterotypic spheroids model (tumoral cells+PBMCs).Our results demonstrate that CisGem and CarboGem present synergistic effects in UTUC spheroid cultures. These treatments also induce DNA damage pathway demonstrated by an increase of &#947;H2AX, P-ATM, P-CHK1 and P-CHK2 positive cells. We found an increase of PD-L1 membrane expression after treatment in UTUC cell lines. RNA Seq analyses indicates that the major pathways upregulated by these combinations are inflammatory pathways (<i>TNF-<\/i><i>&#945;<\/i><i> signaling via NFkB, interferon alpha response, inflammatory re<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>ponse, <\/i><i>interferon gamma response<\/i>). We could observe an immune cell death induction demonstrated by an increase of ATP and HMGB1 release and calreticulin translocation. We showed cGAS\/STING pathway activation as evidenced by an increase of P-IRF3 and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) expression. We demonstrated an inhibition of the ISGs induction after treatment by our chemotherapies when cells are treated with an ATM inhibitor or in UMUC-14 deleted for STING. And we finally showed that CisGem and CarboGem can increase immune infiltration in the heterotypic tumor spheroids.<br \/>These results indicate that the combination of platinum salts + gemcitabine induces inflammatory pathways via a non-canonical STING pathway dependent on ATM activation in UTUC model. Furthermore, these combination induce an upregulation of PD-L1 expression and allow immune cells attraction at the tumor. All these data support that a combination CisGem or CarboGem with an anti-PD-L1 will be efficient for UTUC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c1c8144-ded3-448d-8743-f3a4fac870c0\/@z03B8ZG7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Therapeutic combinations,Chemotherapy immunomodulatory effects,Inflammation cGAS.STING,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16869"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"992aad46-416d-4eb5-9206-aa4650027d2b","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/992aad46-416d-4eb5-9206-aa4650027d2b\/@z03B8ZG7\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexandra Fauvre<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadia Vie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathilde Robin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clara Taffoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadine Laguette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Faget<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurent Gros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurélie Garcin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Celine Gongora<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadine Houede<\/i><\/presenter>.

A tyrosine to cysteine substitution at amino acid 220 of the p53 protein (Y220C) is one such hotspot mutation (~1 % of all solid tumors). Small molecules that reactivate Y220C mutant p53 activity to be like wild type have been developed at PMV Pharmaceuticals and the lead compound PC14586 is in Phase I clinical development. The molecules were designed to bind tightly to a crevice within the Y220C p53 mutant protein and stabilize it to a wild type conformation allowing reactivation of p53 transcriptional activity and expression of target proteins (e.g. p21, MDM2), resulting in tumor regression in Y220C p53 mutant xenograft models grown in immunocompromised mice. p53 has been documented to contribute to immune responses by activating regulators of immune signaling pathways and to result in T-cell exclusion in tumor models. To investigate the role of p53 and the immune system in tumorigenesis, a Y220C <u>hu<\/u>man <u>p<\/u>53 <u>k<\/u>nock-<u>i<\/u>n (HUPKI) mouse was generated. Mice that are homozygous mutant for the Y220C humanized alleles succumbed to lymphomas and sarcomas within 6 months and cell lines generated from these tumors were shown to be sensitive in an in vitro proliferation assay to Y220C p53 reactivators (IC<sub>50<\/sub> ~ 192-722 nM) and used to generate Y220C mutant syngeneic mouse models. Administration of Y220C p53 reactivators in Y220C p53 syngeneic mouse models resulted in a dose responsive anti-tumor effect, with maximally efficacious doses resulting in durable cures in nearly all animals, more than observed in immunocompromised mouse models. Addition of checkpoint agents with sub-efficacious administration of Y220C reactivating compounds resulted in synergistic increases in mean survival time of mice, longer than with either single agent. Immunophenotyping analysis of HUPKI Y220C mutant tumors exposed to p53 reactivator compounds showed modulation of the tumor immune environment. Changes include dose responsive increases in T-cells (CD4+, CD8+), T-regulatory cells, natural killer T cells and dose responsive decreases in macrophages (M2) and g-MDSC cells. The synergy observed with an anti-PD-1 combination appears driven by an increase in CD8+ T cells, given a decrease in efficacy in mice depleted of CD8+ T cells, following exposure to anti-CD8. Further investigation into the role of Y220C p53 reactivation in immune modulation showed decreased cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammation (i.e. CXCL10, Ccl2) and an increase in a Tumor Inflammation Signature (nanoString) in a dose and time dependent manner. Taken together, these data suggest a role for p53 signaling in encouraging an immunologically hot tumor microenvironment and provide support for testing small molecule reactivators of mutant p53 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7a16cf79-512b-497e-975e-64b8166905bf\/@A03B8ZG8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16871"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna M.

For instance, chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients with TP53 wild-type tumors have a median overall survival of 45 months, vs 263 months for TP53 mutant tumors. Treatments fail to eradicate these cancers for two reasons: the tumor cells 1) avoid intrinsic cell death, and 2) escape immune clearance. We have shown that p53 drives a program of senescence that arrests the cell cycle to prevent intrinsic modes of cell death such as mitotic catastrophe, apoptosis and nutrient deprivation. However, it is not currently understood how breast cancer cells that enter senescence to survive chemotherapy escape immune clearance.<br \/>Here, we show tumor cells from mice and human patients that survive chemotherapy activate complex programs of immune modulation. Surprisingly, the surviving, senescent tumor cells are highly enriched for many antigen presentation genes and positive regulators of T cell activation, suggesting they have switched from immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; to &#8220;hot&#8221;. Unfortunately, these senescent tumors concurrently upregulate redundant expression of many T cell inhibitory checkpoint genes, including CD80 and PD-L1. scRNA-seq and cell imaging revealed that CD80 and PD-L1 each mark unique populations of cells in the treated tumor, typified by p53 signaling or interferon signaling, respectively.<br \/>In p53 wild-type, syngeneic, orthotopic mouse mammary tumor models that recapitulate human breast cancer response to chemotherapy, treatment of tumors with chemotherapy followed by targeting of the PD-L1 and\/or CD80 axes improved response, including complete eradication in some instances. Unfortunately, however, even combination strategies failed to elicit a cure in the majority of cases. Our findings reveal the formidable challenge of eliminating residual disease populated by senescent cells that express multiple redundant immune inhibitory pathways and suggest rational strategies are needed based on the specific checkpoint pathways expressed in residual disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b18ebe65-2e7d-44ac-9854-2e6325095ea6\/@A03B8ZG8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Chemotherapy,Senescence,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16873"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ashkan Shahbandi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fang-Yen Chiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan A.

SHP2 plays an important role in oncogenic RAS signaling, the hallmark of PDA, that reduces tumor MHC-I expression and promotes immunotherapy resistance by stabilizing PD-L1. It modulates multiple T cell inhibitory pathways including PD-1 signaling via dephosphorylation of ITIM and ITSM. We hypothesize that SHP2i will increase anti-PDA immunity and help overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade when combined with gemcitabine, an active cytotoxic agent against PDA with pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects on its TME.<br \/>Methods: Mouse KPC-luc cells (derived from LSL-KrasG12D\/+;LSL-Trp53R172H\/+;Pdx-1-Cre GEMM) and human RAS mutant PDA cells were treated <i>in vitro<\/i> with various concentrations of RMC-4550, a potent and selective allosteric SHP2 inhibitor, to test its cytotoxicity using cell viability assay and measure tumor MHC-I and PD-L1 expression upon IFNy stimulation. Human PBMC were used for T cells <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments to examine the effect of RMC-4550 on T-cell proliferation inhibition by PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) stimulation. In vivo antitumor activity of RMC-4550 combined with &#945;PD-1 or with &#945;PD-1 and gemcitabine was investigated in a syngeneic KPC-luc subcutaneous model. After treatment, tumors and spleens were harvested, digested to single cell suspensions, and immune infiltrates quantified using flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: <i>In vitro<\/i>, there was no direct cytotoxicity of RMC-4550 on mouse KPC or human PDAC cells and no additive effect to gemcitabine. SHP2i increases IFNy mediated upregulation of MHC-I, and downregulates PD-L1 in both KPC mouse and MiaPaca-2 human PDA cells. <i>In vitro<\/i>, RMC-4550 reverses the PD-L1-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation. <i>In vivo<\/i>, SHP2i with &#945;PD-1 has a combinatorial effect on tumor growth inhibition. Gemcitabine seems to augment this effect. Preliminary data revealed no significant changes in number of immune cells in treatment groups when compared to the control group while an increase in proportion of Granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells and Ki-67+ CD8+ T cells in spleen and a decrease in proportion of PD1+ CD8+ T cells in TME was observed in RMC-4550 plus &#945;PD-1 plus gemcitabine group compared to the control group.<br \/>Conclusion: SHP2i RMC-4550 and &#945;PD-1 combination induces significant anti-tumor benefit in an in vivo PDA tumor model, an effect that is enhanced by adding gemcitabine. SHP2i may promote antitumor immunity in part by increasing MHC-I expression and reducing PD-L1 expression in RAS mutant PDA cells. PD-L1 mediated suppression of T cell proliferation was overcome by RMC-4550. In vivo, RMC-4550 may potentiate anti-PD-1 therapy by enhancing cytotoxicity of CD8+ effector T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/78b09b53-92fd-493e-b5e7-56d77c3289a9\/@A03B8ZG8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Pancreatic cancer,Tumor immunity,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16876"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Agnieszka Looney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uma Giri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yezi Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Somma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nisha Holay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Milad Soleimani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heta Gandhi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Capasso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeanne Kowalski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Matsui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carla Van Den Berg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>S Gail Eckhardt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todd Triplett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kyaw Lwin Aung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Here, we report a novel heterodimeric bifunctional fusion molecule, HCW9218, constructed using our soluble tissue factor (TF)-based scaffold technology comprising extracellular domains of the human transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;) receptor II and a human interleukin (IL)-15\/IL-15 receptor &#945; complex. This fusion complex exhibited TGF-&#946; neutralizing activity <i>in vitro<\/i> and sequestered plasma TGF-&#946; <i>in vivo<\/i>. Subcutaneous administration of HCW9218 was well tolerated in mice, with a half-life sufficient to provide long lasting biological activity. HCW9218 enhanced metabolic and cytotoxic activities of immune cells (CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, NK cells) and reduced tumor progression in models of chemotherapy induced senescence (TIS, docetaxel for B16F10 tumors and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel for SW1990 tumor models) and non-TIS <i>in vivo<\/i>. Mechanistically, HCW9218 treatment not only affected the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment but also enhanced CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells and NK cells infiltration and cytotoxicity in the tumors to eliminate TIS cancer cells. Immune-depletion studies showed that HCW9218-activated NK cells played a pivotal role in TIS cancer cell removal. HCW9218 treatment following docetaxel chemotherapy further enhanced efficacy of tumor antigen-specific and anti-PDL-1 antibodies in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice. We also show that HCW9218 treatment lowered senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors in off-target tissues in chemotherapy treated tumor-bearing mice. Thus, HCW9218 may serve as a novel therapeutic (monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy) to simultaneously provide immunostimulation and lessen immunosuppression associated with tumors. HCW9218 has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to proceed for evaluation in a first-inhuman Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Immunotherapy,Cancer immunotherapy,Malignant melanoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16879"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pallavi Chaturvedi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Varghese George<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bai Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niraj Shrestha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Micheal Dee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyun Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack Egan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin-an Jiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Spanoudis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jilan Xing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Gallo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Echeverri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lijing You<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriela Muniz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Rhode<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hing Wong<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therapies that block CD47 on cancer cells show promise in clinical trials for solid and hematologic malignancies, particularly when combined with other anticancer agents. However, the best combination strategies for using CD47-blocking therapies remain unknown.<br \/>In this study, we developed a novel in vitro screening platform to identify drugs that render cancer cells more vulnerable to macrophage attack. We performed an unbiased screen of 800 FDA-approved drugs using primary human macrophages and PC9 cells, a human EGFR mutant lung cancer cell line. We identified EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as drugs that act on the cancer cells and specifically enhance macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity (&#62;4-fold enhancement, p&#60;0.01). In contrast, conventional chemotherapy drugs either showed no significant enhancement or abrogated macrophage activation. The combination of EGFR TKIs with anti-CD47 antibodies elicited maximal phagocytosis across a range of cell lines and conditions. In long-term co-culture assays with macrophages, the combination of EGFR TKIs and anti-CD47 antibodies eliminated persister cells to prevent TKI resistance. Importantly, these findings extended to lung cancers with other RTK-MAPK pathway mutations, such as ALK-rearranged cancers (treated with lorlatinib, alectinib, or crizotinib) or KRAS G12C mutant cancers (treated with sotorasib or adagrasib). In xenograft and syngeneic mouse models, the combination of targeted therapies with CD47 ablation was able to dramatically reduce tumor burden.<br \/>To understand the mechanism of synergy, we generated 8 different lung cancer cell lines resistant to EGFR, ALK, or KRAS inhibitors. The resistant lines significantly upregulated CD47 and concomitantly became more sensitive to macrophage attack in vitro and in vivo. By RNA sequencing, we identified multiple mechanisms contributing to vulnerability, including secretion of the cytokine MIP-3 by the cancer cells and alteration of other immunoregulatory molecules. Overall, we have identified a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of RTK-MAPK pathway inhibitors by combining them with anti-CD47 therapies.<br \/>Our findings suggest cross-sensitivity occurs such that lung cancer cells that become resistant to targeted therapies also become more sensitive to macrophage attack. Our findings provide rationale for testing this combination approach in patients with lung cancers bearing driver mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f906b6f-d098-4941-845e-bfa566fb5c99\/@A03B8ZG8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Targeted therapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,CD47,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21179"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kyle Vacarro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliet Allen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asaf Maoz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Reeves<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Hata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kipp Weiskopf<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In advanced prostate cancer patients, immunotherapy treatments have largely failed. Androgens have pleiotropic functions in prostate cancer; they are potent drivers of cancer cell growth and can suppress T cell function. In metastatic prostate cancer, intratumor androgen levels can remain high. Androgen deprivation therapy, the backbone of clinical care in prostate cancer, is classically administered to inhibit tumor cell growth. We postulated that this therapy also impacts tumor associated T cells. To test this hypothesis, we performed transcriptome profiling of individual leukocytes isolated from metastatic prostate cancer lesions resistant to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and androgen receptor (AR) antagonism and prior to treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor. We reveal that inhibition of AR activity in CD8 T cells prevented T cell exhaustion and improved responsiveness to PD-1 targeted therapy via increased IFN&#947; expression. Notably, AR directly bound to <i>Ifng<\/i> and eviction of this transcription factor with a small molecule significantly increased cytokine production in CD8 T cells. Furthermore, genomic deletion of <i>Ar<\/i> prevented chronically stimulated CD8 T cells from losing their ability to make IFN&#947; upon restimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that AR blockade sensitizes multiple tumor mouse models to effective checkpoint blockade by directly enhancing CD8 T cell function. Together, our findings establish T cell specific AR activity as one mechanism of immunotherapy resistance and show that targeting AR can improve immunotherapy outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen deprivation therapy,Androgen receptor,Immunotherapy,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16881"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amy E.

One mechanism by which tumors suppress the anti-tumor T cell activity that results from ICB is through decreasing extracellular tumor pH (pHe), a function inherent to tumor cells due to the Warburg effect. We thus hypothesize that increasing pHe prior to ICB therapy potentiates the T cell-mediated anti-tumor effect of ICB treatment. To undergo this study, we first screened a panel of six inhibitors termed pH sensitizers, and found that esomeprazole significantly reduced the proton efflux rate (PER) of 4T1, but not B16-F10 cells. Furthermore, esomeprazole did not significantly reduce cell viability of either 4T1 or B16-F10 cells, and did not significantly inhibit T cell activity. Moving forward, our next objectives are to investigate the effects of esomeprazole and the combination of esomeprazole and ICB on tumor-bearing mice. Assessment of the tumor growth in response to esomeprazole and ICB and ex vivo interrogation of the immune cell infiltrate into the tumors will elucidate the efficacy of the treatment combination in terms of tumor control and anti-tumor immunity. Modification of pHe by esomeprazole will be examined by acidoCEST MRI, which will also provide insights as to the ideal pHe parameters for optimal ICB therapy in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd100aff-c6a2-462f-bb26-e380bb7b150e\/@A03B8ZG8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor Acidity,CEST MRI,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16882"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Renee Chin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge De la Cerda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Schuler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark D.

Here, we tested the efficacy of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAPI-04, a novel FAP-targeted radiotherapy, alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy in a mouse model of melanoma to attenuate tumor growth. Using B16F10 murine melanoma cells, we implanted tumors in C57BL\/6 mice. Animals were divided into four groups: untreated control, molecular targeted <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAPI-04 radiotherapy treatment, immunotherapy treatment, and combined radio- and immunotherapy treatment. We assessed tumor growth over time and animals were sacrificed at 21 days. After sacrifice, tumors were dissected out and preserved for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Growth curves demonstrated that immunotherapy and radiotherapy each individually attenuated tumor growth, but together they resulted in tumor regression in the majority of animals. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased caspase-3 staining in tumors treated with combined <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAPI-04 radiotherapy and immunotherapy compared to untreated tumors or tumors treated with either therapy alone indicating an increase in apoptotic cell death. Ki67 expression exhibited inverse staining with moderate expression in untreated samples, low expression in immunotherapy and radiotherapy treated samples, and no staining in tumors treated with combined therapy. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that tumors treated with either therapy exhibited an increase in M2 macrophages, however this population was obliterated in dual-treated tumors. Together, these data support that targeting FAP with targeted radiotherapy is an effective treatment which synergizes with immunotherapy to modulate cells of the myeloid lineage as an effective anticancer therapy for melanoma. Future translational studies are needed to further study the synergies between FAP-targeted radiotherapies and immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/69dedbf8-5fa3-4a3e-b94d-f68987b8dc2e\/@A03B8ZG8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Radioimmunotherapy,FAP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16883"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kathleen M.

We used brachytherapy (BT) to deliver a heterogeneous RT dose within a single tumor and compared the relative capacities of BT and homogenous dose external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to enhance the anti-tumor immune response in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI).<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> We used syngeneic murine models of melanoma (B78) and prostate cancer (Myc-CaP). To evaluate the effect of BT on the microenvironment, mice bearing B78 tumors were randomized to receive BT (<sup>192<\/sup>Ir source, 2 Gy to tumor edge), sham insertion, or EBRT (2, 8, or 20 Gy). Tumors were harvested 3 days following RT and in the case of BT, punch excisions were taken from the dissected tumor 1, 3, and 5 mm from the source location for gene expression and immune cell infiltration analysis. To evaluate anti-tumor response, we randomized mice bearing B78 tumors on the right flank (~200 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) and left shoulder (~100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) to BT alone, catheter insertion alone, BT + ICI (anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4, 200 &#181;g IP injection days 3, 6, 9 after RT), EBRT (2 or 8 Gy) + ICI, or ICI alone. Mice bearing MyC-CaP tumors were randomized to sham insertion, BT (2 or 8 Gy to tumor edge), BT + ICI, EBRT (2, 8, or 20 Gy) + ICI, or ICI alone. Immediately following RT, mice were engrafted with a secondary tumor.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Using qPCR analysis, we observed statistically significant differences in gene expression of <i>Mhc-1<\/i>, <i>Ifn&#946;<\/i>, and <i>Vcam<\/i> between tissue locations in BT treated tumors. Furthermore, in a single tumor BT optimally engaged all three pathways while each EBRT dose only optimally engaged one. Bulk RNAseq analysis revealed unique gene expression signatures between tissue locations in BT treated tumors. We observed significant differences in number of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and FOXP3<sup>+<\/sup> cells between tissue locations. In B78 tumor bearing mice, we observed a greater anti-tumor response at the secondary untreated tumor with BT + ICI (63% CR) compared to EBRT + ICI (12.5% CR). In mice bearing Myc-CaP tumors treated with BT + ICI, we observed a significant reduction in tumor growth compared to other groups and no engraftment at the secondary tumor. This effect was dependent on both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cells and was sensitive to BT dose. Splenocytes harvested from disease-free mice co-cultured with tumor cells showed significant increases in expression of T cell activation markers in both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cell populations.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We report dose-dependent effects of RT on expression of immune susceptibility markers and immune cell infiltration in a murine tumor model. We observe that a heterogeneous dose of BT results in spatial differences in these effects within a single tumor. This spatial heterogeneity in activation of immune mechanisms may underlie a greater capacity of BT to augment anti-tumor immune response when combined with ICI, as compared to homogenous dose EBRT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17419638-5dce-4d49-817f-9b02359cad2b\/@A03B8ZG8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioimmunotherapy,Immune Checkpoint Blockade,Intratumoral heterogeneity,Brachytherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16884"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justin C.

TTFields therapy is approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma or mesothelioma. In addition to an established anti-mitotic mechanism of action, previous studies have shown that TTFields-induced cell death stimulates anti-tumor immunity and promotes the maturation of dendritic cells.

SBRT allows high fractional doses (&#8805; 8 Gy), which may result in a fundamentally different biological effect from conventional radiotherapy (RT). The effects of SBRT are mediated by cytotoxic, inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms. The latter are of particular interest and their understanding is the key to potentiating the local effect and synergy with immunotherapies. Several studies have shown the involvement of the immune system in the antitumor efficacy of RT, but these studies were mainly conducted in subcutaneous murine tumor models using conventional doses of RT. In contrast, the effects of ablative irradiation (IR) doses on the infiltration and activity of immune cells are poorly understood, especially in orthotopic models.Here we used a murine orthotopic model of NSCLC to evaluate the effects of high doses of RT, delivered using a small animal radiation platform (SARRP) that allows stereotactic IR with a millimetric precision. Mice were subjected to a trans-pleural injection with Lewis lung carcinoma cells expressing luciferase (LLC-Luc) and irradiated at doses ranging from 8Gy to 60Gy in 1-3 fractions. Our results show that orthotopic LLC tumors, which correctly develop as single tumor mass within the lung parenchyma, are resistant to SBRT, with no complete tumor regression observed even after 60Gy IR. The characterization of the tumor environment by at the clinically relevant dose of 20Gy showed transient (by day 3 post-IR) increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and inflammatory monocytes within the tumor bed but not in the juxtatumor tissue. Resident alveolar macrophages where mostly detected in the juxtatumor tissue and were depleted by RT. Although RT did not affect interstitial tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) number, we observed that the fraction of CD206<sup>+<\/sup> TAM was decreased together with an increased proportion of MHC class II<sup>+<\/sup> TAM. At later time points, Treg harboring increased CD69 accumulated in the tumor bed and TAM recovered a similar phenotype compared to non-irradiated mice. The analysis of the tumor cytokinome revealed the modulation of several cytokines and chemokines including CCL-5, CXCL-10, LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor) and Eotaxin. Altogether, these results argue that high IR doses induce transient and localized activation of the tumor immune environment that is rapidly dampened by anti-inflammatory cell recovery, such as Tregs and CD206 TAMs. The ongoing analyses using a single-cell RNAseq approach on sorted CD45<sup>+<\/sup> cells will allow a precise evaluation of the composition and phenotype of the tumor immune populations.The results of this project will guide the design of therapeutic combinations with immunomodulatory agents to optimize the tumor response to SBRT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/355a12cc-96ae-4471-9c28-671d4a92c361\/@B03B8ZG9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Radioimmunotherapy,Stereotactic,Orthotopic models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16887"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Céline Clémenson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morgane Dos Santos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxime Petit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Lavigne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Winchygn Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Milic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georges Tarlet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agnès François<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandre Boissonnas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabien Milliat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Michele Mondini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Deutsch<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our prior findings in patients and in preclinical studies suggest that one mechanism whereby RT increases tumor immunogenicity is by enhancing the expression of neoantigens.<sup>1,2<\/sup> In response to RT, cells rapidly transcribe and translate hundreds of genes associated with the DNA damage response (DDR), protein turnover and cellular stress. Genes in these pathways are frequently mutated in cancer. Thus, we hypothesized that the presence of immunogenic mutations in genes upregulated by radiation could help predict the benefits of RT used in combination with ICB. In order to develop such a predictor, we built an in vitro system to study the RT-induced transcriptional response of primary human tumors cultured as patient-derived tumor organoids (PDO). PDOs were established from 2 breast cancer (BC), 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 3 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. PDOs were irradiated with doses of 5 to 8 Gy daily for 3 days (n=4) or left untreated (UT, n=4) and cultured for 24h prior to RNA extraction. RNA sequencing was carried out using a NovaSeq6000 sequencer (Illumina) to a depth of 30 million reads. Differential expression analysis between RT and UT samples was performed using DESeq2 and significantly perturbed genes were defined as genes with fold change greater than 1.5 and adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05. In total we detected an average of 15,000+\/-800 protein coding genes per sample and the number of genes modulated by RT was found to vary with cancer type. This ranged from an average of 3.9+\/-1.6% genes upregulated by RT in NSCLC to 12.1+\/-2.5% in CRC organoids. There were 104 and 490 genes commonly upregulated by RT in NSCLC and CRC, respectively. One of the BC PDOs is a triple-negative BC and the other HR+ and despite this difference, we identified 24 commonly upregulated genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), revealed enrichments in DDR and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways among the upregulated genes. Whole exome sequencing and paired normal tissue was used to determine the variants and predicted neoantigens for these PDOs. In one of the EGFR mutated NSCLC PDOs we found that among the genes transcriptionally upregulated by RT, 18 carried somatic mutations predicted to be antigenic. The presentation of these neoantigens is being investigated by mass spectrometry analysis of the immunopeptidome eluted from surface MHC-I molecules. Similar investigations are being carried out in the other models. Overall, results support the feasibility of identifying a common signature of RT upregulated genes in PDOs. This will provide a system to predict RT- exposed neoantigens. [1] Formenti et al. Nat. Med. 2018;24(12):1845-1851, [2] Lhuillier et al. J. Clin.
