[{"Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b>: Previous studies have demonstrated poorer survival of Black women with breast cancer. We assessed whether race\/ethnicity was associated with disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) among women with breast cancer enrolled in clinical trials for early-stage breast cancer according to tumor subtype, age, and body mass index (BMI).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 10,011 women enrolled in one of four adjuvant chemotherapy trials: CALGB 9741, CALGB 49907, CALGB 40101, or NCCTG N9831. 9918 participants had available DFS and\/or OS data and were included in the analysis. Cox models were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between race\/ethnicity and DFS and OS. We compared Non-Hispanic (NH) Black (n=871), Hispanic (n=436), and other race participants (n=283) to NH Whites (n=7889). We assessed associations within strata of age group (&#60;50, 50-&#60;65, or &#8805;65), tumor subtype (hormone receptor (HR)+\/HER2-, HR-\/HER2+, or HR-\/HER2-), and BMI (&#60;25, 25-&#60;30, or &#8805;30).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In multivariable-adjusted models, NH Black patients under 50 years of age had worse DFS compared to NH White patients (HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.10-1.62) and worse OS (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.30-2.07). The differences in DFS and OS persisted in patients ages 50 to &#60;65, though there were no significant differences in DFS or OS between NH Black and NH White patients ages &#8805;65. Among Hispanic and NH White participants, younger age at diagnosis was associated with greater DFS compared with older age overall while this was not true for NH Black patients. Among patients with HR+\/HER2- tumors, NH Black patients when compared to NH White patients had worse DFS (HR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.70) but there was not a significant difference in OS (HR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.00-1.83). DFS and OS for other tumor subtypes did not significantly differ by race. Among patients with BMI &#60;25, NH Black patients had significantly worse DFS (HR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.25-2.30) and OS (HR:1.76, 95% CI:1.20-2.58) compared to NH White patients. There was no difference in survival between different race\/ethnicity groups among individuals with BMI &#8805;25.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our results identified subgroups that may contribute to the observed disparities in survival between NH Black and NH White women with early-stage breast cancer. The greatest disparities are among individuals &#60;50 years of age, those with HR+\/HER2-, and those with BMI &#60;25. These differences exist even within clinical trial populations with similar initial therapy, suggesting that disparities may be influenced by inequities in survivorship care and long-term treatment, such as endocrine therapy adherence and persistence, and\/or differences in tumor or host biology.<br \/><b>Support:<\/b> U10CA180821 and U10CA180882; <b>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers:<\/b> NCT00003088, NCT00005970, NCT00024102, NCT00041119; <u>https:\/\/acknowledgments.alliancefound.org<\/u><u><\/u>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/690f79f6-8015-4c4b-a134-3e8d907ec42d\/@y03B8ZCn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Race,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14487"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marla Lipsyc-Sharf<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karla V.

More recently, sunitinib, has prolonged survival in patients (pts) with metastatic disease resistant to imatinib. 10-year survival for high-risk pts treated with adjuvant imatinib is 79%. Median overall survival for pts with unresectable or metastatic GIST is 4.8 years. In order to bring access to these life-saving medications to pts in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), The Max Foundation (TMF) developed its Max Access Solutions (MAS) program in 2017, after administering Novartis&#8217; imatinib (Glivec) International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP) since 2002. We analyzed the outcomes of pts enrolled in these programs from 2002-2020 for both adjuvant (n=2100) or metastatic (n=9,867) GIST across 67 countries.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Demographic data and treatment indications were reported by treating physicians. The clinical status of each enrolled pt was reviewed with TMF every 3-4 months. Pts who were lost to follow-up (LTFU) (n=2282) with metastatic or unresectable disease were presumed to be deceased. Alternatively, for patients treated in the adjuvant setting an imputation based informed censoring model was used to estimate events for LTFU patients (n=477). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the distribution of progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The median age at diagnosis was 54 and 55 years in the adjuvant and metastatic groups, respectively. Males comprised 59.5% of all metastatic\/unresectable cases and females 51.3% of adjuvant cases. Median OS for pts treated with imatinib for unresectable or metastatic disease was 5.8 years (CI: (5.6, 6.1)) and PFS was 3.5 years (CI: (3.5, 3.7)). Pts treated with imatinib in the adjuvant setting had a 10-year OS of 72% and PFS of 70%. Median OS of pts with metastatic disease treated with sunitinib was 2 years (CI: (1.5, 2.5)); PFS was 1.2 years (CI: (0.9, 1.6)). Multivariate analysis showed that male sex was a negative prognostic factor in both the metastatic and adjuvant setting. Other variables including World Bank Income groups and frequency of contact were not associated with increased mortality or progression in any group.<br \/><b>Discussion:<\/b> This is the largest known cohort of GIST outcomes and the first study to present outcomes from predominantly low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, studies in LMICs are challenged by high rates of lost to follow-up which can falsely prolong or shorten survival times due to censoring. Therefore, we employed an informed censoring model to better reflect survival in the adjuvant setting. We demonstrate that access to a targeted oral anti-cancer therapy results in outcomes similar to those in high resource countries and provides a model to help close the global gap in cancer outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imatinib,disparity,GIST,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14488"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Edward Lloyd Briercheck<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>J.

We demonstrate a novel nucleic acid isolation and anchoring approach that facilitates uniform, consistent replication of the isolated and captured DNA and RNA. This approach allows for expanded investigations of precious samples and increases the value of biobanked material.<br \/>Methods: Our simplSEQ replication methodology enzymatically adds homopolymeric tails to the 3&#8217; end of DNA and RNA, with a terminal dideoxy biotin-modified NTP, to attach the nucleic acids to streptavidin beads. The 3&#8217; immobilized nucleic acids are copied using complementary homopolymers. The simplSEQ advantage is that molecules of all sizes are attached and copied from their 3&#8217; ends yielding cDNA copies that are full-length representations of the input. Various DNA samples were investigated to determine the characteristics of cDNA copies as well as stability of bound nucleic acids. Samples evaluated included Human 1,000 genome project, bacterial genomes, commercial DNA controls, and synthesized DNA molecules. The samples represent a range of DNA sizes, AT\/GC content and Variant Allele Frequencies (VAF). NGS assays quantified the presence of full-length genomic sequences. Variant analysis determined accuracy of copies based on comparison with published data (NA12878). Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides representing regions in the human genome and constructed to enable molecular counting independent of adapter ligation efficiency. All sample types were replicated, sequenced, and analyzed for coverage and uniformity. This replication process was repeated multiple times.<br \/>Results: Three replicates of each DNA type were attached to streptavidin beads and subjected to multiple rounds of the simplSEQ protocol. Analysis of overall coverage and variant calling for human NA12878 replicates compared to the platinum standard NA12878 genome show an average coverage ranging from 27x-32x with &#38;gt;99% correlation between replicates. Sensitivity ranging from 98.6%-99.5%, with a precision range from 96.0% to 98.0% for 6 replicates. Bacterial samples with coverage over 100x and &#38;gt;99% correlation. Synthetic DNA oligonucleotide pools with coverage over 10,000x and &#38;gt;99% correlation.<br \/>Conclusion: Our novel enzymatic tailing methodology produces highly accurate copies of full-length nucleic acids. This technology obviates sample scarcity for genomic evaluations and allows for expanded hypothesis testing in translational research. This methodology also provides an option for extended storage of nucleic acids from which replicates can be repeatedly generated to allow for reinterrogation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4bc947a3-be54-47e2-bd37-36541fd9073d\/@y03B8ZCn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Biobanking\/biospecimen collection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biobank,cfDNA,DNA,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14489"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John Christopher Spinosa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon Young<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Aguilar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baiju Parikh<\/i><\/presenter>. simplSEQ, Inc., Murrieta, CA, InterpretBio, Cleveland, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3978d2d8-b2c3-4fc8-b10b-bca43b545a1f","ControlNumber":"4918","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Further, we showed that transcriptional\/translational loss of RD3 highly associated with advanced disease stage and poor clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma (NB) patients. We identified that RD3 loss is instrumental in NB pathogenesis and, more importantly defined its acquired loss in progressive NB after intensive multimodal clinical therapy. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms, how acquired loss of RD3 orchestrates NB progression. Cell lines derived during diagnosis from stage 4 NB patients off primary (CHLA-15) or metastatic (CHLA-42, SH-SY5Y) site, those with constitutive RD3 expression was used as parental controls. Analogous clones of stable RD3 knockouts were developed (shRNA-RNAi), validated (immunoblotting) and were assayed for whole genome transcriptomic modifications using high-throughput Illumina transcriptome RNA-Seq. Differential gene expression analysis with stringent criteria (log2 fold change) coupled with false discovery rate calculation clearly identified 575 conserved (across three independent cell-lines) genetic determinants that could translate RD3-loss associated disease progression. IPA-functional bioinformatics identified regulation of cellular-lineage directed (stem-cell pluripotency, EMT, Senescence, epithelial adherens junction etc.) signaling coupled with select tumor evolution (NF&#954;B, GPCR, mTOR, Wnt\/&#946;-catenin, stat3 etc.) signaling. Individual gene QPCR validation of experimentally observed 13 lead (mean FDR &#62;7.0) candidates affirmed RNA-Seq outcomes. Actuated FAM129A, HAS2, ICAM1, S100A11, TSPAN8, HLA-F, ASIC4, AXL, VCAM1, KLHDC7B, MAGEL2 and, repressed tumor suppressor FOXN4 and NB differentiation factor ROBO2 in RD3-KOs recognized diverted cell lineage (EMT, poor differentiation, stimulated CSCs, CSC stemness maintenance), drug resistance, immune modulation\/evasion, and tumor progression (clonal selection and expansion, growth and malignancy, invasion and migration, angiogenesis). For the first time, these results demonstrate the RD3-loss dependent transcriptomic addiction of disease evolution drivers in NB cells. Further, the outcomes imply that RD3 directly regulates key CSC cell lineage and tumor progression \/ dissemination signaling events. Current investigations are appropriately directed to unveil the functional mechanism(s) that could benefit salvage therapy for progressive NB.

Liver resection leading to post-operative liver failure is a devastating complication that can be mitigated by pre-resection embolization techniques to increase the future liver remnant, such as portal vein embolization (PVE) and transarterial radioembolization (TARE). The purpose of this study was to understand the natural history of this treatment algorithm in disparate patient populations.<br \/>Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study from 2008 to 2018. The population consisted of non-transplant eligible patients that had various malignancies without extra-hepatic disease who underwent TARE, PVE, or resection at our institution; they were propensity matched based on co-morbidities, etiology of liver disease, Child-Pugh Score, and ECOG performance status. Statistical analyses were performed with chi-square.<br \/>Results: We identified 196 patients with an average age of 57.8&#177;12.6 years and 119 patients were male (60.7%). There were 137 Caucasian patients (CC, 70%) and 59 African American patients (AA, 30%). The tumor histologies were 61 HCC, 31 ICC, 65 CRHM, 12 NET, and 28 other. 148 of these patients underwent liver resection. HCC patients were more likely to undergo TARE (36.4%) compared to ICC (20%), CRHM (23.6%), or NET (9.1%, P= 0.043). While AA patients were more likely to undergo any embolization procedure compared to CC patients (47% vs 31%, P=0.03), they were less likely to undergo PVE (P=0.018). 126 patients (64%) did not undergo any pre-resection embolization procedures. Of patients requiring pre-resection embolization, CRHM patients were more likely to undergo PVE (80%) than other patients (P=0.029). TARE was a bridge to resection for 9 patients.<br \/>Conclusions: AA patients underwent more embolization procedures compared to CC patients. It is not clear whether this was because that population required more interventions to optimize FLR or had limited access to care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed7f6807-3178-4233-873b-c1a5b701494b\/@y03B8ZCn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Surgical oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Surgical resection,Radioembolization,Primary and metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18149"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia Pedo Freitas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pradeep Podila<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel K.

Here we present the first comprehensive CH analysis including 2,872 pediatric cancer survivors from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (median follow-up of 26 years from cancer diagnosis; median age of 31 years at blood draw) using deep sequencing (10,000 &#215;) over 39 CH genes on DNA derived from peripheral blood. As a comparison group, 324 age-, sex- and race\/ethnicity-frequency-matched community controls (median age of 35 years at blood draw) were also analyzed. To detect rare CH variants, a machine-learning approach was applied, which characterized true variants as outliers in a genomic context-specific error profile. Digital droplet PCR validation was performed for 543 variants (323 positive [allele frequency: median 0.003, range 0.001 to 0.255] and 220 negative) out of 1,450 putative variants. The 907 untested variants were inferred using the 543 experimentally validated variants&#8217; status as a training set. Analyses considered mutation status by the 555 positive variants and clinical data including age, sex, and detailed cancer treatment exposures. CH was detected in 15% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 13.7 to 16.3) of survivors and 8.6% (95% CI: 5.6 to 11.7) of controls in an age-dependent manner: 10.6% (survivors) vs. 6.3% (controls) for ages in year 18 - 29; 13.5% vs. 5.8% for 30 - 39; 26.3% vs. 13.2 % for 40 - 49; 28.1% vs. 17.2% for &#62; 50. We also observed that the alterations in DNMT3A, TP53, STAT3, KRAS and TET2 became more prevalent as the survivors aged: combined proportion for the 5 genes, 61% for ages in year &#60; 30; 72% for 30 - 40; 77% for 40 - 50; 87% for &#62; 50. Analysis of longitudinal samples available for 73 survivors with 180 time points (median interval 4.6 years [range: 2.07 to 8.0 years]) confirmed that clones with these gene mutations had a higher growth rate than those without (p=0.034), suggesting fitness advantages in hematopoietic stem cell context. Multivariable analysis adjusted for treatment indicated that CH development is associated with cumulative dose of alkylating agents (Odds Ratio (OR) for 1st tertile 1.77 [95% CI: 1.22 to 2.57], 2nd tertile 2.72 [95% CI: 1.83 to 4.04], and 3rd tertile 2.92 [95% CI: 2.03 to 4.02], relative to the unexposed) and estimated radiotherapy-dose to active bone marrow (OR for 1st tertile 0.98 [95% CI: 0.68 to 1.40], 2nd tertile 1.06 [0.77 to 1.47], and 3rd tertile 1.57 [1.15 to 2.14], relative to the unexposed), supporting the hypothesis that CH development in survivors is primarily driven by prior therapy. This study identified accelerated CH development in pediatric cancer survivors, which may represent an important genomic biomarker predictive of future adverse health risks.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cedb4fd0-e7b3-4083-90a1-9f0a34511160\/@y03B8ZCn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-04 Late effects of cancer and its treatment, including second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Clonal Hematopoiesis,Pediatric cancer survivors,digital droplet PCR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18978"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kohei Hagiwara<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaoming Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haseeb Zubair<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Easton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather L.

The purposes of this study were to examine and visualize the relationships among NPS within networks over time and evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics associated with symptom networks.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A total of 192 patients (mean age 59.5&#177;10.1 years, 75% male, 81% White) completed symptom questionnaires four times, namely, before RT (T1), 1 month (T2), 3 months (T3), and 1 year (T4) after RT. Network analysis was used to explore relationships among the five common NPS. Centrality indices, including strength, closeness, and betweenness, were used to describe the degrees of symptom interconnection. The network comparison test was used to assess the differences between two symptom networks.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Depression (reported by 13%-24% of patients) was associated with the other four symptoms, and fatigue (reported by 54%-77% of patients) was associated with the other three symptoms across four times. Based on centrality indices, depression (r<sub>strength<\/sub>=1.1-1.4, r<sub>closeness<\/sub>=0.07-0.08, r<sub>betweeness<\/sub>=4-12) was the most central symptom in all four symptom networks, followed by fatigue (r<sub>strength<\/sub>=0.8-1.0, r<sub>closeness<\/sub>=0.05-0.06, r<sub>betweeness<\/sub>=0-2). Higher levels of stress and no alcohol use were associated with stronger symptom networks in network global strength (low stress: 1.49 vs. moderate to high stress: 1.92; p=0.02; no alcohol use: 2.38 vs. alcohol use: 1.75; p=0.01), but not in network structure or edge strength prior to RT. No significant differences were found in other time points.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Network analysis provided a novel approach to gain insights into the relationships of co-occurring NPS and identify central symptoms and associated characteristics.

Kidney injury in the setting of allo-HSCT has an incidence as high as 80% and leads to high patient morbidity and mortality, however, its progression and mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Moreover, no approved drugs for AKI of any etiology exist, as most experimental therapies have poor pharmacokinetic profiles and minimal efficacy in treating AKI in humans. We have characterized the pathology, genetic and molecular signatures of GVHD-mediated AKI in a murine model of HCT. GVHD results in AKI characterized predominantly by T-cell infiltration and activation of inflammatory pathways in both donor infiltrating inflammatory cells, as well as resident cells (i.e. tubules). By RNA sequencing, we have identified specific inflammatory pathways that are differentially expressed between healthy and GVHD mice and can serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, we have synthesized nanoparticles that can specifically target proteins overexpressed in GVHD-kidneys and can encapsulate a variety of small molecule drugs. The complete understanding of this disease and development of this technology has a high potential to improve clinical practice and patient prognosis after allo-HCT, but it can also serve as a platform for treating other forms of cancer-associated kidney injury (e.g. induced by nephrotoxic chemotherapy), thus affecting the life of numerous patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86a16cc5-311c-4c21-a73d-4249a8d04600\/@z03B8ZCo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-06 Supportive care, palliation, and pain management,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone marrow,Nanoparticle,kidney injury,supportive care,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Magdalini Panagiotakopoulou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Grabarnik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edgar A.
