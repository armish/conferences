[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>Cancer-Testis antigens (CTA&#8217;s) are normally expressed in germline tissue, however, aberrant expression occurs in some cancers. Restricted CTA expression in normal tissues make CTA&#8217;s potential vaccine targets. CTA&#8217;s have been associated with tumor cell proliferation and invasion. The CTA A-kinase anchor proteins 4 (AKAP 4) plays a role in cancer development and progression. The expression pattern of AKAP4 gene in CRC is not well characterized. This study&#8217;s aim was to assess AKAP4 expression in CRC and to assess this CTA&#8217;s potential as a vaccine target.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>CRC patients (pts) undergoing surgery who donated tissue to an IRB approved tissue\/data bank comprise the study group. Demographic and pathologic data were assessed. Tissues were OCT embedded and stored at -80<sup>0<\/sup>C. Total purified RNA was isolated from tissue samples and cDNA synthesized. AKAP4 expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR (QPCR) using EXPRESS qPCR universal Supermix and Taqman assay. Comparative quantitative analysis was performed based on the delta-delta Ct method with GAPDH as internal control. Tumor and testis AKAP4 expression levels were determined; tumors with levels 0.1% or more than the testis was considered positive. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on a subset of tumor and normal tissue. The impact of tumor location and cancer stage on AKAP4 expression was determined and assessed (Wilcoxon signed rank test).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>70 paired CRC and normal tissue specimens (35 M\/36 F, age 67.8&#177;14) were studied (86% colon,14% rectal; cancer stage: 1, 24%; 2,37%; 3, 31.%;stg 4, 7%). The percent of pts with a relative Malignant to Normal tissue AKAP4 expression ratio (MN) over 1 was 17%; the percent with both MN ratio over 1 and expression levels above 0.1% of testis levels was 16%. IHC demonstrated AKAP4 in a subset of CRC tumor samples. No significant difference was noted between colon vs rectal, or cancer stage groups. No expression was found in 21 normal samples.<br \/><b>Discussion: I<\/b>n a tumor subset the relative expression of AKAP4 was above that of normal colon and more than 0.1% of testis expression. IHC study demonstrated the antigen in CRC tumors. A larger study is needed determine if AKAP4 expression correlates with T, N, or final tumor stage. AKAP4 holds some promise as a vaccine target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b4316443-c647-46dd-8597-1142ba3c5932\/@D03B8ZKA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal,Cancer vaccine,Vaccines,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14185"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chandana S.

OPN is an integrin binding phosphorylated glycoprotein implicated in cell-mediated immunity, inflammation, tumor progression, and cell viability. OPN is secreted by macrophages and leukocytes. OPN activity is associated with the PI3K\/AKT and ERK pathways and VEGF mediated tumor angiogenesis. MMP-2 degrades type IV collagen and facilitates tumor cell invasion and metastasis. MMP-2 also promotes tumor angiogenesis. This study&#8217;s first purpose was to compare preoperative (PreOp) plasma OPN and MMP2 levels in CRC and benign pathology (BP) patients (pts); the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> purpose was to assess the combination of these proteins for diagnosis.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> PreOp plasma samples obtained from consenting CRC and BP pts undergoing surgery were used for this study. Prospectively gathered demographic, clinical and pathologic data were analyzed. Plasma levels of OPN and MMP2 (ng\/ml) were measured via ELISA and reported as median + 95% CI. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic value of each protein alone and in combination. Expression levels of OPN and MMP2 were determined in tumor and normal tissue for a subset of pts by QRT-PCR. The Mann-Whitney test was used for analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Plasma from 156 CRC (73% colon, 27% rectal) and 102 BP (polyp 32%, diverticulitis 56%, other 12%) pts was studied. CRC stage breakdown was: 1, 26%; 2, 33%, 3, 29%, 4, 12%. CRC median preop plasma levels were significantly higher vs. the BP group for both proteins [OPN; 82.4,CI:75.4, 89.5 vs 59.2, CI:53.8,63.3;MMP2; 203.6,CI:195.0,214.5 vs 160.2,CI:151.9,172.2; P&#60;0.0001). Higher OPN levels were noted in stg 3(p=0.04) and Stg 4(p=0.01) vs stg 1 pts. The AUC value for the ROC curve for OPN and MMP2 were 0.73 and 0.73 respectively with 61% and 70% specificity. The AUC for the 2 protein combination was 0.80 with 65% sensitivity and 80% specificity. OPN and MMP2 expression was elevated in 75% and 50% of CRC tumors tested, respectively (n=12).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Median CRC OPN and MMP2 levels were significantly higher (39% and 27%) than BP levels. OPN and MMP2 expression was confirmed in a subset of pts. This 2 protein combination improved the AUC and specificity for CRC diagnosis.

The disease-initiating event in most CRC cases is the loss of function (LOF) of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, accounting for 70-80% of CRC. Strategies to target cells that harbor the truncation mutation in APC, which leads to its LOF, may provide the opportunity to intercept tumorigenesis in CRC patients. High-risk CRC populations include patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the inherited disorder caused by germline APC mutations. Aurora Kinase (AK), a family of serine\/threonine kinases, is essential for proper cell division, and overexpression of AK has been associated with multiple heme and solid tumor malignancies, including CRC. Aurora kinases have been well-studied, both preclinically and clinically, as a target for therapeutic intervention across multiple cancers; however, the role of AK in CRC disease progression has not been fully explored. Here we report a synthetic lethal dependency between APC and AK which was identified in a human isogenic colon organoid model containing a genetically engineered APC LOF (APC<sub>LOF<\/sub>). Aurora A-specific, Aurora B-specific, and Pan-AK inhibitors were evaluated in isogenic APC<sub>LOF<\/sub> or APC<sub>WT<\/sub> colon organoids derived from multiple donors. All AK inhibitors demonstrated selective growth inhibition of the APC<sub>LOF<\/sub> organoid. The strongest synthetic lethal effect was observed with a pan-AK inhibitor showing greater than 1000-fold selectivity in the APC<sub>LOF<\/sub> colon organoids compared to APC<sub>WT<\/sub>. Interestingly, this activity diminished as oncogenic driver mutations in KRAS and\/or p53 genes were introduced into the APC<sub>LOF<\/sub> organoids. These findings suggest that therapeutic benefit of AK inhibitors would be greater in early APC<sub>LOF<\/sub> driven adenomas as opposed to advanced CRC. Despite these encouraging results indicating therapeutic opportunity in early adenoma disease, on-target genotoxicity was observed <i>in vitro<\/i> through increases in micronuclei at pharmacologic doses. Therefore, although there is a high unmet need in FAP for therapeutic options, potential genotoxicity associated with AK inhibitor treatments may limit utility as an intervention strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/da6f0571-47e1-4b2d-9726-a9dfc6c41904\/@D03B8ZKA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aurora kinase,Synthetic lethality,APC,Colorectal,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14186"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dana S.

A drawback to conventional drugs in this class are drug-drug interactions and side-effects and that would be poorly tolerated when taken on a chronic basis for prevention. To address this issue we designed an analog of the prototypical PDE5i sildenafil by replacing the methyl group on the piperazine ring with malonic acid to reduce lipophilicity. This modification did not affect pharmacology as malonyl-sildenafil had an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 1.8 nM, but exhibited almost 100-fold reduced cell entry compared to sildenafil. Using an LC-MS\/MS approach, malonyl-sildenafil was undetectable in mouse plasma 1 hour after gavage, even at a dose up to 36 mg\/kg, but was readily detected in the feces collected 2-4 hours after administration. This contrasted with sildenafil that was detected in the plasma, but not in the feces. While sildenafil exhibited the established C<sub>max<\/sub> at 1-2 hr, malonyl sildenafil was not detected in the plasma up to 24 hr after an oral dose of 9 mg\/kg, but continued to be shed at high levels in the feces for up to 8 hrs. Treatment of mice with malonyl-sildenafil in the drinking water for 8 days was well-tolerated, and resulted in a suppression of proliferation in the colon epithelium that is consistent with results published previously for mice treated with PDE5i. Taken together, the results demonstrate that a carboxylic acid-containing analog of sildenafil prohibits systemic delivery but maintains sufficient penetration into the colon epithelium to suppress proliferation. This highlights a novel approach to generate a first in class drug for colon cancer chemoprevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a9e2dd7-e47b-493f-a9d7-33f726e58d30\/@D03B8ZKA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-10 New agent development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Chemopreventive agents,Pharmacokinetics,Drug design,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14187"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bianca N.

Its activity is implicated in various disease conditions such as tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, chronic inflammation and diabetic nephropathy. Detecting the activity of heparanase thus is a promising approach for the discovery of diagnostics and therapeutics for these diseases. We have developed an activity-based disaccharide probe for heparanase, which offers over 700-fold of fluorescence increase in the presence of human heparanase. In this project, we aim to build up an ultrasensitive single heparanase detection system by coupling a sensitive fluorogenic probe with a microwell-based device. The microwell-based device is designed to achieve single enzyme separation and significantly increase the sensitivity of detection.

Early symptoms, which include abdominal and back pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and jaundice are non-specific for PDAC and may be associated with other gastrointestinal diseases. PDAC lacks reliable and accurate tests for early detection. We aimed to discover biomarkers carrying a PDAC-specific DNA methylation signature in blood cell-free DNA, and to develop and validate a non-invasive test for PDAC detection.<br \/>Methods: Reduced representative bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was previously performed on tissue and plasma samples from PDAC patients and healthy individuals to identify PDAC-specific methylation markers. These markers were combined with previously reported cancer methylation markers for a second round of marker screening. The resulting markers were utilized to develop a targeted methylation sequencing assay for plasma DNA, designated as PDACatch. The PDACatch assay was validated on an independent sample set to demonstrate its efficacy for pancreatic cancer methylation signature detection.<br \/>Results: The PDACatch assay was performed on 91 PDAC plasma and 84 healthy plasma samples obtained from commercial biobanks. In this independent verification sample set, the PandaX assay predicted PDAC from healthy with AUC of 0.91; accuracy remained high for classification of both stage I and early-stage (I\/IIa) samples.<br \/>Conclusion: The PDACatch assay, a ctDNA methylation based blood test, achieved a high accuracy for detecting PDAC at early stages, indicating its potential in screening effectiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/df8c231c-cc83-4e95-b331-2f0a672c9f1b\/@D03B8ZKA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-11 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Early detection,Screening,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14193"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Athurva J.

The CD137 is an immune checkpoint stimulator has pleiotropic immune functions along with its canonical role in driving CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses. Using a novel form of its natural ligand (SA-4-1BBL) as a single agent, we recently showed its robust cancer immunoprevention efficacy against various transplantable tumor types in mice. In this study, we report its efficacy in a spontaneous tumor model and elucidate the mechanistic basis of prevention.<br \/>Study design:<b> <\/b>Mice were treated subcutaneously with SA-4-1BBL protein twice, two weeks apart, and challenged with various tumor types 1-14 weeks later. Animals were monitored for tumor growth. The LSL-Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> mice, as a model of spontaneous lung cancer, were intranasally infected with 2.5 &#215; 10<sup>7<\/sup> PFUs of adenoviral-cre to induce cancer. Animals were treated with SA-4-1BBL twice, two weeks apart, pre or post-infection with adeno and euthanized at various times to collect the lung and lymphoid tissues for histopathology and flow cytometry.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Pretreatment with SA-4-1BBL was effective in preventing the growth of various transplantable tumors, B16-F10 melanoma, 3LL lung cancer, A20 lymphoma, 4T1 breast cancer, in different mouse strains. Treatment with SA-4-1BBL induced a window of protection against tumors that lasted over 14 weeks. SA-4-1BBL treatment significantly reduced the lung tumor burden in LSL-Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> mice that was associated with increased absolute numbers of CD137<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup>CD44<sup>hi<\/sup> T cells and CD137<sup>+<\/sup>NKG2D<sup>+<\/sup>NK cells expressing IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945;. A blocking antibody to NKG2D reversed the immunopreventive efficacy of SA-4-1BBL in the 3LL and B16-F10 tumor models, providing direct evidence for the role of this receptor in cancer immunoprevention.

This approach is particularly relevant for prostate cancer since it is characteristically indolent, and thus delaying disease progression can be highly advantageous for patients. Therefore, identifying molecular features predictive of cancer progression and response to specific interventions is vital to improve precision prevention in prostate cancer. In this regard, expression levels and localization of the tissue-specific homeobox protein, NKX3.1, helps distinguish men with high risk for developing more aggressive prostate cancer. Our recent study revealed a novel function for NKX3.1 in mitochondria, where it regulates aberrant mitochondrial oxidative stress to suppress prostate cancer initiation. Lower NKX3.1 expression levels at gene and protein levels are associated with poor outcome and higher risk for aggressive prostate cancer. We are now investigating the role of NKX3.1 as a prognostic marker and potential target for prostate cancer precision prevention interventions. Our new preliminary data indicate a role for metformin as a preventative intervention in contexts of reduced NKX3.1. Specifically, we have shown that metformin reduces oxidative stress and suppresses cancer initiation in the prostates of <i>Nkx3.1<\/i> mutant mice. Moreover, studies in human prostate cancer cells as well as human prostate cancer organotypic assays revealed that metformin can indeed, restore mitochondrial function and inhibit tumorigenicity in the absence of NKX3.1. Although men on active surveillance for prostate cancer may benefit from metformin intervention, it has been unclear whether metformin is effective in delaying disease progression and, if so, whether specific patients are more likely to benefit. Our new data implicate NKX3.1 status as a predictor of response to metformin, suggesting that it can stratify high-risk prostate cancer patients most likely to benefit from such intervention during active surveillance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/769978cf-f540-498e-86bb-f0ab4b6c9f8c\/@D03B8ZKA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Precision Prevention,Metformin,NKX3.1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14207"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexandros Papachristodoulou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aditya Dutta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cory Abate-Shen<\/i><\/presenter>.

In contrast, patients diagnosed at early and locally advanced stages (I-IIIA) can undergo surgery and have a significantly better prognosis. Imaging technologies often detect lung nodules of unknown significance that pose a diagnostic challenge. In a proof-of-concept study, based on a 76-patient cohort, we developed a preliminary mRNA expression signature in plasma that discriminated healthy individuals from early-stage NSCLC patients with AUC=0.98. Here, we aimed to expand the training cohort, to refine the diagnostic signature and to prospectively validate the final signature in the clinical setting.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Two hundred and thirty individuals with pulmonary nodules suspicious of lung cancer have been enrolled in the training cohort.

The different subtypes of lung cancer have distinct radiologic appearances, and the most predictive radiological features for one subtype may not be useful in others. However, the management strategies of these IPNs are based upon the probability of the nodule being a cancer, regardless of subtype. We recently developed a predictive nested model which incorporates a series of subtype-models, each trained on a specific cancer histology, with each subtype model probability score secondarily used as predictive variables in a larger nested model. This work serves as a validation of the model in an independent cohort derived from patients who underwent bronchoscopic biopsy for their IPN deemed suspicious enough to warrant biopsy, which therefore represents a diagnostically challenging cohort of IPNs.<br \/>Methods: Computed tomography (CT) images from 263 patients with IPNs measuring 6-30 mm were included from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center navigation bronchoscopy cohort. 180 patients (68%) were ultimately diagnosed with lung cancer: 91 adenocarcinoma (ADC), 27 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 7 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 55 other non-small cell lung cancer. Nodules were segmented using HealthMyne image analysis platform (Healthmyne, Madison WI). The probability of cancer for each patient was calculated using the Mayo Clinic model (the baseline model), and then using a previously trained nested-generalized linear model (N-GLM). Model performance was assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) using bootstrap validation.<br \/>Results: The ROC AUC showed that the N-GLM outperformed the Mayo Clinic model, with an AUC of 0.64 (95% C.I. of 0.54-0.70) for the N-GLM vs 0.55 (0.49-0.65) for the Mayo Clinic model. The N-GLM also outperformed our previously reported model trained using a logistic regression model on all lung cancers vs benign (AUC of 0.61, 95% CI of 0.46-0.63).<br \/>Conclusions: A set of radiomic predictive models trained against each cancer subtype which were then nested within a larger predictive model was validated and found to outperform the clinical baseline Mayo Clinic Model and other quantitative radiomic models among a cohort comprised of the most diagnostically challenging indeterminate pulmonary nodules.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d56eb45-8f36-4783-ade1-d9adce3624f1\/@E03B8ZKB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-11 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Risk stratification,Indeterminate Pulmonary nodules,Nested prediction model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14213"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Khushbu H.

Yet, not all familial cancer cases can be explained by genetic factors. There is mounting evidence that environmentally-induced epigenetic inheritance occurs and that the progeny&#8217;s traits can be shaped by parental environmental experiences. In humans, epidemiologic studies have implicated endocrine disruptors and environmental toxicants such as the pesticide DDT in intergenerational cancer development, including breast and childhood tumors. Using a mouse model, we investigated whether paternal DDT exposure may result in an intergenerational increase in breast cancer development. We also investigated the effects of DDT on the paternal germline and the mechanisms underlying intergenerational transmission. Male mice (c57bl\/6) were exposed to DDT or to a control-vehicle (CO) solution and used for sperm collection or mating with unexposed females to produce the DDT or CO daughters. In another experiment, normal mouse embryos (zygote stage) were injected with RNA purified from sperm of DDT or CO males or miRNA mimic. Resulting zygotes were implanted into surrogate mothers to produce offspring. DDT daughters or RNA injected females were used to study breast cancer development (carcinogen-induced or orthotopic models). We found that<b> <\/b>the<b> <\/b>female progeny of males exposed to DDT in<b> <\/b>the pre-conception period have higher susceptibility of developing aggressive tumors in two different mouse models of breast cancer. Sperm of DDT-exposed males exhibited distinct patterns of small non-coding RNAs, with an increase in miRNAs and a specific surge in miRNA-10b levels. Remarkably, embryonic injection of the entire sperm RNA load of DDT-exposed males or synthetic miRNA-10b recapitulated the tumor phenotypes observed in DDT daughters. We also found that E3.5 embryos injected with miR-10b have altered transcriptional profile compared to controls. Our findings reveal a causal role for sperm RNAs in the inheritance of cancer predisposition and could explain some of the &#8220;missing heritability&#8221; of breast and other malignancies, if confirmed in humans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/203d4a1f-b5c7-4a6b-b65d-0aaa40077b7c\/@E03B8ZKB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Environmental exposure,Noncoding RNA,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14216"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Raquel Santana Da Cruz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Odalys Dominguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Apsra Nasir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra K.

Tumor cells can shift their phenotype in response to treatments, the so-called adaptive resistance. Adaptive resistance mechanisms in malignant brain tumors are still poorly understood, and effective treatments have not yet been developed. To unveil such mechanisms, we have developed unique new experimental models to identify the adaptive resistance mechanisms to fractionated radiation in malignant brain tumors. We performed repeated irradiation (2-5Gy every 3-4 days, 3-6 weeks) on 6 human Glioma stem cells (GSCs), 2 mouse GSCs and 4 medulloblastomas (MB) cells in vitro and examined how tumor cells adapt to repeated irradiation. Brain tumor cells demonstrated dynamic adaptation to fractionated irradiation. They rapidly altered cell proliferation, intercellular adhesion, and stemness and acquired strong radioresistance. To identify genes responsible for radio-resistance, we performed RNA-seq analysis and CRISPR library screening using primary and radioresistant cells. We found that N-cadherin was upregulated in the majority of radioresistant GSCs. Stably transfecting N-cadherin in parental GSC rendered them radioresistant, reduced their proliferation, and increased their stemness and intercellular adhesive properties. Conversely, radioresistant GSCs lost their acquired phenotypes upon CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated knockout of N-cadherin. Mechanistically, elevated N-cadherin expression resulted in the accumulation of b-catenin at the cell surface, which suppressed Wnt\/ b-catenin proliferative signaling, and reduced neural differentiation. Moreover, N-cadherin increased Clusterin secretion, which protected GSCs against apoptosis after radiation treatment. We also demonstrated that N-cadherin upregulation was induced by radiation-induced IGF1 secretion, which caused an EMT-like phenotype change in GSCs. The N-cadherin-mediated radioresistance phenotype could be reverted with picropodophyllin (PPP), a clinically applicable blood-brain-barrier permeable IGF1 receptor inhibitor. Adjuvant PPP combined with irradiation significantly extended the survival of orthotopically xenografted mice versus irradiation-only or drug-alone controls, supporting clinical translation. In conclusion, our data indicate that IGF1R inhibition can block the N-cadherin-mediated resistance pathway. Our study deepens our understanding of adaptive resistance during repeated irradiation in GBM, and validates the IGF1\/N-cadherin\/b-catenin\/Clusterin signaling axis as a novel target for radio-sensitization, which has direct therapeutic applicability. These findings also confirmed that our radioresistant models effectively identify new adaptive resistance mechanisms in malignant brain tumors.

ADO directly metabolizes cysteamine to produce hypotaurine and taurine in mammals. ADO has also been recently identified to promote oxygen dependent stability of a subset of substrates involved in the N-degron pathway in mammals (IL32, RGS4 and RGS5). The ability of ADO to target protein stability of signaling molecules suggests that it may have the potential to transduce rapid responses to hypoxia and affect tumour initiation and progression phenotypes. Here, we have successfully knocked down and knocked out ADO using two independent siRNAs and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system, respectively. We have assessed proliferation and migration through the Incucyte&#174; ZOOM system by imaging cell confluency over time. Survival was assessed through a clonogenic assay. siRNA mediated knockdown of ADO in cervical (HeLa and SiHa), pancreatic (Panc1 and Capan2) and liver (SNU499 and Huh6) cancer cell lines drastically reduced proliferation, survival, and migration in normoxia. These results were also replicated in hypoxia (0.2% O<sub>2<\/sub>) across all 6 cell lines. Out of the 6 cell lines, the liver cancer cell lines were most drastically affected by the knockdown of ADO. This phenotype was replicated in the ADO KO cell lines. Taken together, these data suggest that expression of ADO may contribute to phenotypes that induce aggressive tumour phenotypes by targeting the stability of specific proteins and altering cellular metabolism in mammals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63594fe2-0203-433d-a4ce-2974497ccacb\/@E03B8ZKB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor biology,Hypoxia,Proliferation,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14235"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sandy Che-Eun Serena Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Hye An Pyo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianne Koritzinsky<\/i><\/presenter>.
