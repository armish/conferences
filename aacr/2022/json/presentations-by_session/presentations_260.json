In <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant LUAD, <i>STK11<\/i> and <i>KEAP1<\/i> mutations are associated with decreased overall survival (OS), but predictors of metastasis have been poorly defined. In this study, we identify clinical and genomic predictors of metastatic <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant LUAD.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Patients with <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant LUAD profiled by targeted next generation sequencing (OncoPanel) were included. Stage, histology, recurrence-free and overall survival were assessed. Clinical and genomic features between metastatic vs non-metastatic samples were compared. <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant LUAD samples profiled using MSK-IMPACT in the AACR GENIE database were used to validate our findings. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and categorical variables were compared using the Fisher&#8217;s Exact test. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox Proportional Hazards model. WExT was used to identify co-occurring and mutually exclusive genetic alterations. Benjamini-Hochberg was used to correct for multiple comparisons. P-values &#60; 0.05 and q-values &#60; 0.10 were considered significant.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the OncoPanel cohort (metastatic n=290; non-metastatic n=324), tumor mutational burden (TMB) (p = .001) and <i>KEAP1<\/i> mutations (q = 0.05) were enriched in metastatic samples, while <i>NFKBIA<\/i> amplifications (q = 0.07) were enriched in non-metastatic samples. <i>KEAP1\/STK11<\/i> mutations significantly co-occurred (q &#60; 1e-8). Compared to double wild-type samples: <i>KEAP1\/STK11<\/i> co-mutations were significantly enriched in metastatic samples (n = 72, p = 0.0002, OR 3.4); <i>KEAP1<\/i>-mutant samples trended towards enrichment in metastatic samples, (n = 21,p = 0.07, OR 2.47); <i>STK11 <\/i>mutations<i> <\/i>did not associate with stage (n = 53, p = 0.88, OR = 0.94). In multivariable survival analysis, metastasis (p &#60; 0.005), <i>KEAP1<\/i> mutation (p=0.01), and <i>STK11<\/i> mutation (p=0.02) were associated with worse OS.<br \/>In the MSK-IMPACT validation cohort (metastatic site n=417, primary site n = 781), <i>KEAP1<\/i> was the only gene enriched in metastatic samples (q &#60; 0.001) at q &#60; 0.05. Compared to double wild type samples: <i>KEAP\/STK11<\/i> co-mutations (n=138, p &#60; 0.0001, OR 2.1) and <i>KEAP1<\/i> mutations (n=59, p = 0.04, OR 1.77) were enriched in metastatic samples; <i>STK11<\/i>-mutations did not associate with metastasis (n = 190, p = 0.34, OR 0.83).

While methods to infer genetic ancestry and admixture have historically relied upon genome-wide markers from broad-scale next-generation sequencing (NGS), the adaptation to targeted NGS panels presents an opportunity to prospectively incorporate ancestry inference as part of routine clinical diagnosis. Here we show that global ancestral contributions and admixture of African (AFR), European (EUR), East Asian (EAS), Native American (NAM) and South Asian (SAS) populations can be reliably inferred using markers from genomic regions covered by the FDA-authorized clinical NGS panel, MSK-IMPACT. We also show that individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish (ASJ) ancestry can be inferred with 97% accuracy using a set of ASJ ancestry-informative markers. We apply these methods to infer genetic ancestry for over 45,000 patients from the AACR GENIE v10.0-public cohort who were profiled using MSK-IMPACT. We observed 98% concordance between self-reported race and genetic ancestry for non-admixed individuals and were able to quantitatively infer ancestral contributions for individuals from recently admixed populations such as African American and Latin American. Of the discordant cases, manual review of clinical and family histories revealed the vast majority to represent clinical encoding errors where the inferred ancestry was confirmed correct. As self-reported race is not available for 17% of patients in the GENIE cohort, the ability to accurately infer genetic ancestry enables broader analysis of population-specific genomic and clinical features. We systematically evaluated the frequency of somatic and germline alterations in up to 468 genes for each cancer type and recapitulated known differences among ancestral populations. For example, we observed significantly higher frequency of <i>EGFR<\/i> somatic alterations in EAS (65%) and SAS (66%) compared to non-ASJ EUR (21%) with lung adenocarcinoma, a difference that remained significant even when limiting to never-smokers. Additionally, we found that the frequency of harboring at least one known <i>BRCA<\/i> founder mutation (<i>BRCA1<\/i> 68_69delAG, <i>BRCA1<\/i> 5266dupC, or <i>BRCA2 <\/i>5946delT) was 26x higher in genetically determined ASJ (5.1%) compared to non-ASJ (0.2%). Strikingly, while the overall rate of driver alterations in solid tumors was similar across different populations, we found that the proportion of patients with clinically actionable somatic alterations (OncoKB Level 1, 2, 3A, or 3B) was lowest in AFR (47%) patients compared to EUR, EAS and SAS (50% each). While this result is partially explained by different cancer type and subtype distributions in different populations in this real-world cohort, it highlights the urgency for greater equity in drug development programs to target alterations represented across all diverse populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Bioinformatics,Cancer genomics,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kanika Arora<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thinh N.

Tumor profiling techniques have led to the identification of actionable alterations to guide treatment and improve survival in cancer patients. However, comprehensive genetic profiling of colorectal cancer tumors from Hispanics living in Puerto Rico (PRH) has not been performed. Our study aimed at understanding the common CRC carcinogenic molecular pathways that affect our Hispanic population by evaluating colorectal tumors from molecularly characterized ethnically diverse cohorts.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the mutational profile of CRC tumors from 218 PRH that underwent NGS testing from 2015 to 2020 (provided by CARIS Life Sciences and the Precision Oncology Alliance). We estimated the prevalence of somatic mutations of PRH CRC tumors and compared them with those reported in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer Atlas Clinical Data and the AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE), both available through the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Descriptive statistics were performed to characterize the database.<br \/>Results: Among the top mutated genes for CRC tumors in PRH were <i>APC<\/i> (81.9%, n=182), <i>TP53<\/i> (75.3%, n=178), <i>KRAS<\/i> (56.2%, n=185), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (18.0%, n=178) and <i>SAMD4<\/i> (12.6%, n=175). For PRH, the most frequent gene amplifications were: <i>CDX2 <\/i>(20.1%, n=184), <i>CDKN1B<\/i> (6.6%, n=183), and <i>HNRNPA2B1<\/i> (5.4%, n=184). Significant differences in the mutational frequencies of CRC driver genes, such as <i>APC, TP53<\/i>, <i>PIK3CA,<\/i> <i>FBXW7<\/i>, <i>CDX2<\/i>, <i>CDKN1B,<\/i> and <i>HNRNPA2B1<\/i>, and actionable genes, such as <i>KRAS\/NRAS<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i> and for <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplifications, among PRH were observed when compared to the TCGA and GENIE<i> <\/i>datasets. The prevalence of MSI tumors for PRH was 2.0%.<br \/>Conclusion: This is the first study to report the mutational profile of CRC tumors from PRH and to describe differences in mutational frequencies when compared other non-Hispanic and U.S. mainland Hispanic populations using data from TCGA and GENIE. Differences in prevalence of immunotherapy and targeted associated biomarkers may contribute to the observed disparities in survival and response to therapies. Understanding the most common carcinogenic molecular pathways that affect Hispanics with CRC is crucial to guide research efforts in the development of new therapeutic modalities incorporating genomically diverse populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Hispanic,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ingrid M.

We found that most of the false-positive mutations in clinical sequencing with FFPE samples are ssDNA-derived artifacts. During the end-repair step of library preparation, chimeric reads are generated by mis-annealing of ssDNA molecules comprising homologous sequences with a mismatched base. The mismatched base is called as a false-positive mutation, and the position of the base is biased towards the effective ends in the individual reads because either side of the chimeric read should be soft-clipped by the mapping pipeline. Based on this theory, we developed a post hoc filter, MicroSEC, to predict such artifacts in FFPE samples.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Fifty-three fresh frozen (FF) and 190 FFPE normal breast tissue samples and 23 FF and 33 FFPE breast cancer samples were obtained from 26 patients, and subjected to capture-based panel sequencing (Todai OncoPanel, TOP). We also obtained TOP data from 54 FFPE various tumor samples. MicroSEC was developed to predict artifacts with BAM files based on the positional bias of mutations within each read. The predictions were validated with amplicon-based sequencing of 97 mutations. We also developed a model which predicts artifacts only from the mutated base information without corresponding BAM files, by using 5,034 MicroSEC predictions as the supervised data with the LightGBM technique. A total of 742,030 mutations from the AACR Project GENIE were examined with the model. <b>Results:<\/b> Among the normal breast tissues, we identified 0.3 and 11.7 somatic mutations per sample in FF and FFPE specimens, and 0 (0%) and 10.1 (86.0%) were filtered out by MicroSEC, respectively. Two unique mutations with variant allele frequency of &#62;50% in FFPE samples were eliminated. From the breast cancer specimens, we identified 4.0 and 10.7 mutations per sample in FF and FFPE, and 0 (0%) and 3.2 (30.2%) were filtered out, respectively. In the clinical sequencing data of 54 FFPE tumor samples, we identified 21.6 mutations per sample and 3.6 (16.6%) including five unique pathogenic mutations were filtered out. The validation study showed that the sensitivity and specificity for artifacts of MicroSEC were 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 82%-100%) and 96% (95% CI: 88%-99%), respectively. Further, the prediction model reproduced the MicroSEC predictions with an area under the ROC curve of 0.995. The model detected 2,512 mutations (0.34%) as artifacts from Project GENIE data. There was a difference in the artifact detection rate between institutions, and 815 (1.45%) of the 56,100 mutations reported by UCSF were predicted as artifacts.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>MicroSEC removes only FFPE artifacts without eliminating true mutations found in FF samples.

Understanding the process of how primary tumors achieve metastatic potential is of great importance and paramount to the development of precision medicine that may limit the aggressive distant spread of metastatic cancer. It is hypothesized that during cancer evolution, cells within the primary tumor obtain metastatic potential through acquisition of specific somatic alterations. However, the defining ability that allows metastasis remains unknown. By comparing genomic profiles of primary and metastatic cancers we wish to investigate if potential metastatic gate-keeper mutations exist, defined as alterations to individual genes or pathways that are required to facilitate metastatic dissemination.Here, we analyzed panel-based DNA sequencing datasets from the GENIE (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange) project, version 9.0. Analyses were performed on 174 shared cancer genes selected to include as many patients as possible while analyzing as many genes as possible. In total 39,036 patients had mutations or copy number alterations in one or more of the 174 shared genes across 25 different cancer types. Using bioinformatic tools, we compared genomic alterations in primary versus metastatic samples. Metastatic samples harbor a higher tumor mutation burden and increased levels of chromosomal instability. However, while we found a higher total level of driver mutations in metastatic samples, these appear primarily driven by a higher mutation burden, and corrected for this, we found a significantly lower level of drivers compared to primary. Overall, phylogenetic analysis showed that primary and metastatic samples clustered together by cancer type. Comparing two logistic regressions models, which was corrected for tumor mutation burden and genomic instability, we found that despite most genes show a relatively low difference in frequency between primary and metastatic disease, 55 of the 174 genes in this panel showed a small but significant overrepresentation in at least one cancer type in either primary or metastatic disease.With this analysis we demonstrate how the power of large datasets can be utilized to make novel inferences on cancer biology. We observed significant enrichment in overall mutation counts and copy number alterations in metastatic samples. However, we found limited genomic differences between primary and metastatic cancer within the same cancer types. This might suggest that acquisition of cancer driver mutations are initially mostly shaped by the tissue of origin where specific cancer driver mutations define the developing primary tumor, while acquisition of driver mutations that contribute to metastatic disease are less specific. It might indicate that the metastatic process is driven less by newly acquired metastatic features, but more by non-cancer features such as inflammation in the surrounding tissue.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Metastatic potential,Genomic instability,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ditte Sigaard Christensen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johanne Ahrenfeldt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mateo Soka&#269;<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judit Kisistók<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas McGranahan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolai Juul Birkbak<\/i><\/presenter>.
