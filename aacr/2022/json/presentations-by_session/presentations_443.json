[{"Abstract":"The individual contribution of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), and their precursors mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) to a pro-tumorigenic and immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in neuroblastoma (NB) is well known. However, whether and how they could cooperate has not been studied in this cancer. This important question, in the context of current immunotherapies for NB, has been addressed here in complementary studies evaluating the TME landscape in primary human NB tumors and examining the production of cytokines\/chemokines and the activation of signaling pathways in NB cells in the presence of human monocytes and MSC-CAF <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. A multiplex immunohistochemistry evaluation of 17 untreated human NB tumors demonstrated the presence of MSC-CAF and TAM representing between 0.5% to 7.4% and 0.4% to 8.4% of the total cell population respectively. MSC-CAF were predominantly present in the stroma around NB cells, while TAM diffusely infiltrated tumors. There was a paucity of infiltrating T cells and NK cells (0.7% and 0.1% of total cells, respectively) in all tumors. MSC-CAF promoted in<i> vitro <\/i>the survival of human monocytes and TAM through their production of IL6 and soluble IL6 receptor. When co-cultured with NB cells, MSC-CAF and monocytes increased the production of pro-tumorigenic cytokines\/chemokines like TGF&#946;1, IL6, IL8, IL10, CCL2\/MCP-1 and induced a high expression in MYCN amplified NB cells and TME cells. In contrast they did not stimulate the production of anti-tumorigenic cytokines like IFN&#947;, TNF&#945; and IL12. Among these multiple cytokines, we demonstrated the central role of TGF&#946;1 which induced the expression of IL6 in NB cells and in MSC-CAF. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that production of IL6 in NB cells was dependent on the activation of NF&#954;B by TGF&#946;1 via TAK1 and SMAD2 signaling pathways. In contrast, in MSC, the production of IL6 was dependent on the transcriptional activity of SMAD2\/SMAD4 but independent of NF&#954;B. Moreover, the significant increase in TGF&#946;1 production and secretion to a level only observed in co-cultures of MSC-CAF, TAM and NB cells led to inhibition of NK cell-mediated NB cytotoxicity. Increased TGF&#946;1, NF&#954;B and IL6 activities were also detected in NB tumors implanted in immunodeficient mice in the presence of human MSC-CAF and monocytes and in primary human NB tumors where we observed a direct correlation between pSMAD2, pSTAT3, and the presence of &#945;-SMA positive MSC-CAF. Our results emphasize the importance of the synergistic role of TAM and CAF in promoting immune escape and resistance to immunotherapies, and the need to define the TME of tumors in patients with NB in order to improve immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/56518406-4aca-481a-b18b-e31c8426b7b1\/@K03B8ZLa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tumor associated macrophages,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11495"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kevin Louault<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tania Porras<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meng-Hua Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sakunthala Muthugounder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebekah Kennedy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurence Sarte<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerardo E.

Indeed, prior studies have specifically linked Cxcl12\/Cxcr4 to breast cancer cell seeding, homing, survival and proliferation at future metastatic sites, due to the aberrant Cxcl12 expression in these sites (e.g. lung, liver and bone marrow). Interestingly however, the precise mechanism via which Cxcr4+ breast cancer cells escape the primary tumors in the first place (which also highly express Cxcl12), remains poorly understood. By using a novel methodology for quantifying chemotactic gradients using fixed tissue multichannel immunofluorescence (mIF), here, we demonstrate in mouse primary breast tumors that Cxcl12 gradients are concentrically expressed around cancer cell intravasation sites, known as Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis (TMEM) doorways. Via distance analysis algorithms using mIF, we also demonstrate that TMEM-mediated Cxcl12 gradients contextually associate with Cxcr4+ breast cancer cells migrating towards the underlying TMEM doorways. As such, pharmacological inhibition of the Cxcl12\/Cxcr4 pathway significantly abrogates the translocation of Cxcr4+ cancer cells to TMEM doorways, suppressing TMEM-mediated metastatic dissemination. However, targeted elimination of the Cxcr4+ gene specifically from breast cancer cells, paradoxically results in a suboptimal response, thus suggesting the existence of a bypass or compensatory mechanism. Previously, it was shown that Cxcr4+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) support the invasive and migratory properties of tumor cells utilizing TMEM doorways. We thus theorized that, in the absence of Cxcr4 expression in tumor cells, the accompanying Cxcr4+ TAMs may still &#8220;read&#8221; TMEM-generated Cxcl12 chemotactic gradients. Indeed, clodronate-mediated TAM depletion results in the significant suppression of Cxcr4+ cancer cell translocation to TMEM doorways and their subsequent dissemination to the peripheral circulation and future metastatic sites. Finally, we used a variety of stromal and immune cell lineage markers to identify the precise source of TMEM-generated Cxcl12 gradients in mouse primary breast cancers. Despite that blood vessels (irrespective of presence of TMEM doorways) were primarily lined by Pdgfrb+ stromal cells with basal Cxcl12 expression, TMEM-generated Cxcl12 gradients were specifically linked to a subset of Cxcl12+Iba1+ perivascular TAMs. Pharmacological inhibition of Pdgfrb depletes Pdgfrb+Cxcl12+ stromal cells, but does not significantly affect Cxcl12\/Cxcr4- mediated translocation of Cxcr4+ tumor cells to TMEM doorways. Overall, our data support a new paradigm for the implication of the Cxcl12\/Cxcr4 axis during the early stages of the metastatic cascade, and propose a new avenue for rationalized antimetastatic treatments for breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Chemokines,Metastatic potential,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11496"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Maria K.

Therefore, there is a current unmet clinical need to identify novel treatment options for this patent population. While anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 immunotherapy has been effective for many NSCLC patients, EGFR-mutant tumors have response rates of less than 10%. The mechanisms driving resistance to immunotherapy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC are not well understood. We previously reported that IL-6 is highly upregulated in NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Because IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine known to impact immune populations within the tumor microenvironment, we hypothesized that IL-6 may drive immunosuppression in EGFR mutant NSCLC. Using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of EGFR-mutant NSCLC with and without IL-6 knockout, we evaluated the effects of IL-6 on the tumor microenvironment. EGFR-mutant mice with knockout of IL-6 had a significantly increased overall survival compared to those with intact-IL-6. Knockout of IL-6 increased total immune infiltration in these tumors as assessed by flow cytometry. Infiltrating T cells from IL-6 knockout mice displayed a smaller population of T helper 17 cells compared to IL-6-expressing tumors. Knockout of IL-6 also increased the population of infiltrating activated CD8 T cells and a reduced T-regulatory cell population. Due to these changes in T cell activity, we wanted to determine any potential synergistic effects of IL-6 blockade used during anti-PD-1 therapy. We observed that combination treatment extended survival in EGFR-mutant NSCLC mice. Corresponding in vitro T cell cytotoxicity assays confirmed that EGFR-TKI resistant cells treated with IL-6 blocking antibody were more sensitive to T cell-mediated killing. Furthermore, infiltration of NK cells was increased in tumors with knockout of IL-6. Infiltrating NK cells found in these IL-6 knockout mice displayed a more activated phenotype as demonstrated by increased expression of NKG2D. Next, we evaluated the effects of IL-6 from conditioned media collected from human EGFR-mutant and TKI-resistant cells lines on human T and NK cells cultured ex vivo. e determined that IL-6 suppressed expression of activation markers including granzyme B and IFN-y on the surface of both T and NK cells. Blockade of IL-6 increased NK-mediated cytotoxic killing of EGFR-TKI resistant cells in vitro. In conclusion, our data indicates that in EGFR-TKI resistance, upregulated IL-6 suppresses T and NK cell cytotoxic potential and drives immunosuppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10611ab0-5bb3-44ee-8a78-ddc0420bb489\/@B03B8ZLb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-6,Immune checkpoint blockade,T cell,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11498"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sonia Patel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monique Nilsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoxing Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fahao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alissa Poteete<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyang Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiuning Le<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Heymach<\/i><\/presenter>.

Furthermore, a dysregulated secretion is one major driver of cancer progression and invasion and therefore holds promise as a general therapeutic target for the treatment of metastases. The overall aim of this study is to gain a quantitative understanding of the CRC secretome to elucidate the influence of the microenvironment on selected players and vice versa the influence of the secretome in vitro and in vivo. In a first attempt to elucidate the role of secreted factors in colon cancer progression, we cultured 20 CRC cell lines (five PDX derived and 15 commercial lines) in 3D spheroid cultures and compared the secreted cytokine profile with the 2D culture conditions of the same CRC cell line panel. We analyzed 45 cytokines in duplicates by using a human specific magnetic bead-based assay. Based on the cluster analysis of those cytokine profiles we categorized the CRC lines into low metastatic, intermediate and highly metastatic lines. To validate this clustering in vivo we implanted one representative cell line of each cluster orthotopically in immune-compromised NSG mice (n=10 per line in two independent experiments) and followed tumor growth by optical imaging twice a week over the course of up to 50 days. Tumor growth and metastases were confirmed by histological examination and terminal ex vivo imaging of the organs. The murine and human cytokine profile of different organs and the serum of tumor bearing mice was determined as well. The predicted highly metastatic cell line HCT116 displayed a latency of 24 days post implantation: after that time tumor cells were detected via optical imaging not only at the implantation site, but as well in kidney, spleen, liver and lungs in 100% of the examined animals. The intermediate cell line HT29 had a latency of 38 days and showed tumor growth in colon and liver of all animals and lung metastases on 80% of the implanted mice. Mice bearing the PDX derived cell line 269, representing the low metastatic phenotype, had to be sacrificed 50 days post implant. Tumor cells were detected at the implantation site. Micro-metastases in liver and lung were detected in only 75% of the animals. The secretome pattern specific for an individual cell line was predictive for the metastatic potential in vivo in an orthotopic mouse model. Of note, none of the mentioned cell lines metastasized when implanted subcutaneously. The detailed analysis of the mouse and human cytokine profiles will help to elucidate the complex crosstalk between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. The modulation of individual signaling cascades in vitro and in vivo will help to gain a deeper understanding of the metastatic process thereby enabling the development of possible new therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eb3ce028-e9b7-4f41-872b-b9b37087ee03\/@B03B8ZLb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Orthotopic models,Chemokines,Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11499"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"2b6c3912-5fe0-4e0e-9bb9-9ebcf1a2d0af","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2b6c3912-5fe0-4e0e-9bb9-9ebcf1a2d0af\/@B03B8ZLb\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jacqueline Bersano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dorothee Lenhard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kanstantsin Lashuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Oswald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Julia Schüler<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Obesity-associated inflammation in adipose tissue correlates with colorectal tumorigenesis and tumor proliferation. The altered secretome of obesity-associated adipose tissue also affects colon cancer growth and development. Hence, we sought to determine the role of adipocyte-derived secreted factors in mediating the tumor-promoting paracrine signaling observed in obesity.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Adipocytes were isolated from the gonadal fat pad of C57BL\/6J male mice fed either a low-fat (10 kcal% fat) or high-fat (60 kcal% fat) diet and cultured for 24 hours. Cytokine production from the cultured adipocytes was quantified using the Bio-Plex Pro mouse chemokine 33-plex panel. To determine if adipocyte-derived metabolites or growth factors promote cancer cell proliferation, human SW620 colon cancer cells were grown for 24 hours in conditioned media and cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. To test whether a subset of these cytokines directly impacted cancer cell growth, SW620 cells were cultured with or without the addition of 20 ng\/mL recombinant IL-6 or 50 ng\/mL CCL5 to the culture media. Proliferation was measured using the MTT assay and gene expression was assessed via qPCR.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Adipocyte-conditioned media contained 19 detectable cytokines, with CCL2, CCL7, and CCL5 being the most abundant. IL-6, CCL12, CCL11, and CXCL16 were all significantly elevated (p&#60;0.05, fold enrichment &#62;2.0) in adipocyte-conditioned media from obese relative to lean mice. SW620 cells demonstrated a &#62;20% increase in proliferation when grown in conditioned media from adipocytes isolated from either low-fat or high-fat fed mice. CCL5 stimulation for 24 hours resulted in a ~17% increase in SW620 cell viability when cultured under replete (10% FBS) growth factor conditions, but a ~8% decrease under reduced (0.5% FBS) growth factor conditions. IL-6 stimulation did not impact SW620 cell growth. To understand the downstream cell signaling effects of IL-6 and CCL5 stimulation, we performed qPCR analysis on EMT and Wnt signaling markers in SW620 cells after 4-hour cytokine stimulation in media without growth factors (0% FBS).

While there is an initial high response rate to cytotoxic chemotherapy, over 80% of advanced cases relapse within 24 months, presenting an urgent need to better understand the molecular mechanisms permitting relapse. Current research suggests that cancer recurrence can be attributed to a small subpopulation of cancer stem-like tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that possess the ability to both resist chemotherapy and initiate tumorigenesis. Our lab previously demonstrated an essential role for alternative NF-kB signaling in maintaining ovarian TICs, yet it is not fully understood how this pathway becomes activated in ovarian cancer. To begin to address this, we used an NF-kB reporter system to screen soluble factors known to be in the ovarian tumor microenvironment (TME) to identify the strongest inducers of NF-kB activation in ovarian cancer cells. We found that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a strong inducer of alternative NF-kB signaling. <i>In vitro<\/i> experiments demonstrate enhanced expression of stemness genes including SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG and increased spheroid formation ability after stimulation with TWEAK. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of several TIC markers shows a significant enrichment of TICs when chemotherapy was combined with TWEAK, relative to chemotherapy alone. Stimulation of CD117+ cells led to higher expression of stemness genes relative to stimulation of CD117- cells, suggesting TWEAK activity may be specific to TICs and enhances their stem-like phenotype. In support of this, we found that CD117+ cells have higher expression of the TWEAK receptor FN14. We investigated the role of TWEAK in aiding relapse <i>in vivo<\/i> using an intraperitoneal xenograft mouse model and found that administration of a small molecule inhibitor of TWEAK-FN14 signaling as a maintenance treatment following chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival. These findings highlight a potential mechanism of TIC enrichment in response to chemotherapy that contributes to relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b350d643-2d02-4887-bdc7-9036d01f0756\/@B03B8ZLb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cell,Chemoresistance,NF-&#954;B,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11614"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Denay N.

HCC development is accompanied by underlying chronic inflammation, which represents a major unifying mechanism for tumor promotion. While some tumor-promoting inflammatory mechanisms had been proposed, the identity of immune mechanisms controlling anti-cancer immunity in HCC remain poorly understood. <b><\/b>Interleukin (IL)-27 receptor signaling plays an anti-inflammatory role in a variety of infectious and chronic inflammatory diseases.

Genetic loss of IL-27R suppressed HCC in both carcinogen-induced and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-driven models. Mechanistically, the pro-tumorigenic effect was mediated by an immunoregulatory role of IL-27R within the tumor microenvironment, particularly the suppression of cytotoxic Natural killer (NK) cells. Single-cell RNA analysis further established the role of IL-27R signaling in restraining cytotoxic populations of NK cells.

The direct impact of salts on immune cells is poorly studied; however, a recent report showed that a higher level of both sodium and potassium in the tumor microenvironment reduce tumor growth by enhancing T cell function. Separately, it was shown that intake of high levels of sodium reduced tumor growth by impairing myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) functions. Still, the effect of high levels of potassium on MDSCs has not been examined. Here, we hypothesize that an excess of potassium in an&nbsp;<i>in-vitro<\/i>&nbsp;culture of mouse bone marrow-derived MDSC (mBM-MDSC) and purified tumor-derived MDSC impairs the cellular metabolism and their immunosuppressive function. To explore this, we evaluated the effect of potassium (40 mM) on the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as a measurement of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). We also tested the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs by protein expression of arginase I (ArgI), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and the immune checkpoint PD-L1 on mBM-MDSC, as well as directly measuring their ability to inhibit T cell proliferation. While excess potassium does not influence the proliferation or viability of mBM-MDSCs, it does affect their immunosuppressive capacity by reducing ArgI, iNOS and PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, excess potassium increases the expression levels of the autophagosome marker LC3&#946;, enhances OCR (an indicator of mitochondrial respiration), and improves the fitness of mitochondrial bioenergetics (maximum respiratory capacity). Interestingly, using the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) in the presence of excess of potassium significantly reduces OCR and rescues ArgI expression compared to control or potassium treatment alone. Additionally, potassium significantly reduced the production of several chemokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including CXCL1, RANTES and IL-10, as well as the expression levels of C\/EBP-&#946; and phosphorylated AMPK, suggesting an alteration of key signaling pathways required for MDSC function. Collectively, this study provides evidence that high levels of potassium change the cellular metabolism of MDSC, reduce their immunosuppressive capacity, impair the signaling of AMPK, C\/EBP-&#946;, and promote autophagy. This may provide novel insights for further investigation on the impact of hyperkalemia or microenvironments with increased levels of potassium, such as intratumorally, on MDSCs and their role on tumor growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/97b35a90-b90f-4e3b-9b69-850802721a7e\/@B03B8ZLb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDSC,Potassium,Immunosuppression,Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11629"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ramesh Thylur Puttalingaiah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Augusto C.

Melanoma patients with a single microscopically positive SLNs are classified as stage III despite the fact that there is significant variation in disease recurrence. Understanding of why there is such a wide disparity in outcomes among these patients may direct us to find a better treatment strategy to reduce recurrence and increase survival. Our previous studies have shown that expression of Wnt10b in the SLN was significantly higher in melanoma patients with recurrence versus those without recurrence. Given the importance of Wnt signaling in the immune response to cancer and the immunosuppression status in local microenvironments in recurrent patients, we suspect that highly expressed Wnt10b may be connected to dysfunction of the immune responses in melanoma patients with recurrence.<br \/><b>Hypothesis:<\/b><b> <\/b>Highly expressed Wnt10b represses anti-tumor immune responses and increases the likelihood of recurrence in melanoma patients. Methods:<b> <\/b>36 retrospective SLN RNA samples from node-positive melanoma patients were used. 18 were obtained from recurrent melanoma patients and 18 were from melanoma patients without recurrence. We performed RT-PCR to confirm the highly expressed Wnt10b in melanoma patients with recurrence and compared the expression of Wnt pathway receptors FZD3 and LRP5 between the recurrent and non-recurrent melanoma patients. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to check the expression of Wnt10b, CD8; a cell surface marker of cytotoxic T cells; and FoxP3; a transcription factor mostly found in T cells associated with immune suppression; as well as the melanoma cell marker SOX10. CyTOF (Cytometry by Time of Flight) was used to compare the immunophynotype of SLN cells from patients that are projected to have higher chance of recurrence versus those who have lower chance of recurrence.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><b> <\/b>Wnt receptors, FZD3 and LRP5 were overexpressed in recurrent patients versus the patients without recurrence. After the data were adjusted for melanoma tumor burden, the ratio of CD8:FoxP3 was significantly lower in recurrent melanoma patients who had higher Wnt10b expression versus those without recurrence who had lower Wnt10 levels.

This is at least in part due to the characteristically harsh tumor microenvironment which limits the delivery of systemic therapies and is not conducive to anti-tumor immune cell function. Unfortunately, development of novel therapeutics is arduous. Thus, identification of methods to augment the efficacy of existing therapeutics, such as immunotherapies, represents an attractive option. Herein, we attempt to sensitize PC to a colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor by augmenting peripheral glucose levels.<br \/>Methods Murine PC cells (KPC) and bone marrow derived macrophages were cultured in hypoglycemic (&#8804;2.5mM) or hyperglycemic (25mM) conditions. Phenotypic (western blot, flow cytometry), metabolic (seahorse, LC-MS metabolomics), and cell survival (clonogenic assay) assays were performed. KPC cells were orthotopically injected into the pancreas of immunocompetent mice for survival studies. Mice were randomized to pexidartinib (a CSF1R inhibitor) or vehicle and received either normal water of 30% dextrose (D30).<br \/>Results: In a co-culture experiment, tumor-supporting M2 macrophages increased KPC cell growth by 30%, whereas tumor-fighting M1 macrophages decreased KPC growth by 95%. M1 macrophages were poorly suited to survive in hypoglycemic conditions as compared to hyperglycemic conditions (relative survival: 38% vs 100%, p&#60;0.01). M2 macrophage survival was equivalent (93% vs 100%, p=0.39). When cultured in hypoglycemic conditions, M1 macrophages adopted an M2-like metabolic profile (i.e., increased TCA cycle metabolites and decreased glycolytic metabolites) assessed by both seahorse and LC-MS metabolomics. As glucose concentrations decreased in culture media over time, protein levels of an M1 marker (inducible nitric oxide, iNOS) decreased and an M2 marker (arginase) appeared, suggesting a phenotypic switch. Pexidartinib augmented M1 iNOS protein levels and simultaneously decreased M2 arginase levels. On an in vitro flow cytometric analysis, the percentage of M2 macrophages (CD206+, CD301+, F480+, CD11b+) decreased as glucose concentrations were increased (33.7% vs 38.0%), and decreased further when pexidartinib was combined with hyperglycemia (20.5%). Mice treated with pexidartinib and D30 had improved median survival relative to mice receiving pexidartinib alone (median survival: 42 (IQR: 38, 52) vs 34 (IQR: 32, 38) days, p&#60;0.05) in two independent experiments. Of note, pexidartinib alone did not improve survival as compared to vehicle or D30.<br \/>Conclusion: Higher glucose conditions promote M1 macrophage survival and function, while preventing the switch to an M2 phenotype. Also, higher peripheral glucose levels appear to sensitize PC to a CSF1R inhibitor. We plan to validate these findings using other immunotherapeutics (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cdcdfeef-a7f3-422b-9147-2a3bbf4785e3\/@C03B8ZLc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Pancreatic cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11631"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jonathan J.

The mechanism(s) underlying obesity-related BC are not clearly understood and, to date, most studies focus on the systemic effects of subcutaneous or visceral adipocytes on BC. We hypothesized that the increased local presence of &#8216;obese&#8217; mammary adipocytes within the breast microenvironment promotes the acquisition of an invasive and vascular breast tumor cell phenotype and thereby markedly accelerates tumor proliferation and progression. We first asked whether local interactions between mammary adipocytes and BC cells might promote tumor growth and if so, what the underlying mechanism(s) might be. BC cells (ER- and ER+), when treated with the secretome of mammary adipocytes from obese women (ObAdCM), upregulated potent angiogenic\/inflammatory factors, including VEGF, bFGF, lipocalin-2 (LCN2), IL-6 and significantly suppressed the angiogenesis inhibitor Tsp-1. ObAdCM stimulated endothelial cell (EC) recruitment by BC cells and increased EC proliferation, indispensable steps in tumor neovascularization. PM ObAdCM significantly stimulated BC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Both IL-6 and LCN2-neutralization resulted in significant reduction of the ObAdCM-stimulated BC cell migration and proliferation, suggesting that these factors play a role in obesity-mediated BC progression. ObAdCM induced pSTAT3\/pAkt signaling in BC cells and IL-6 and LCN2 could independently stimulate pSTAT3 in BC cells. STAT3 inhibition abrogated the ObACDM-mediated effects on BC cell proliferation and migration, suggesting that the pro-tumorigenic effects of PM obese mammary adipocytes are mediated by LCN2\/IL-6\/STAT3 signaling. Comparative RNAseq analyses identified &#62;30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PM compared to pre-menopausal (Pre-M) obese mammary adipocytes. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs suggested an upregulation of PI3K\/Akt signaling, ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesions and lipid\/fatty acid metabolism in PM mammary adipocytes. Taken together, our results indicate that obese mammary adipocytes in the breast tumor microenvironment can promote migration, proliferation, invasion and the vascular phenotype of BC cells and suggest that targeting the LCN2\/IL-6\/STAT3 signaling axis may be a useful strategy in the treatment of obesity-driven breast tumorigenesis.

An estimated 235,760 new cases of lung cancer and 131,880 lung cancer deaths are expected this year accounting for 12% of new cancer cases and 22% of cancer deaths in the United States. Exosomes are secreted vesicles that contain selectively packaged biomaterials (protein, lipids, and RNA) and serve as a form of extracellular communication between cells in the tumor microenvironment. Previous studies have shown the effects of cancer-derived exosomes on specific cell types or gross tumor response in vivo yet, the competitive nature and dynamics of exosomal uptake in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. This work seeks to identify molecular responses induced by cancer-derived exosomes on cells residing in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>In order to control tumor cell exposure to cancer-derived exosomes, heterogeneous ex vivo cultures derived from subcutaneous Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors in C57BL6 mice were exposed to fluorescently dyed LLC exosomes for up to 72 hours. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to identify preferential uptake of cancer exosomes into the stromal subpopulations of tumor cells. Increased uptake was observed throughout the duration of the exposure and preferential uptake was observed into neutrophils, macrophages, and endothelial cells while cancer cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes were underrepresented in the exosome uptaken population. Additionally, single cell RNA-sequencing was performed 24 hours post-exosomal exposure to identify transcriptional changes promoted by cancer exosome uptake. We found tumor-derived cancer cells to up-regulate transcripts associated with proliferation and down-regulated genes associated with interferon signaling in response to exosome uptake.<br \/>These preliminary findings suggest that cancer-derived exosomes have targeted effects on specific cell types in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically in cancer cells, exosomal uptake can elicit protumor (cancer proliferation and immune suppression via decreased interferon signaling) effects that may serve as mediators of disease progression. An understanding of both cancer and host-derived exosomal response to disease progression may identify novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets previously undiscovered using canonical discovery methods.<br \/><i>This study received funding from LLNL LDRD grant 21-LW-028.<\/i> <i>This work was conducted under the auspices of the USDOE by LLNL (DE-AC52-07NA27344).

Extensive work has been done to understand paracrine signaling via cytokines, chemokines, and metabolites secreted from tumor cells, but only recent studies have begun to investigate the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargoes in the tumor microenvironment. Studies have illustrated the ability of PDAC-derived EVs to activate and recruit pancreatic stellate cells in the tumor microenvironment; however, no work has been done in vivo to determine whether this EV uptake occurs within tumors. Additionally, little mechanistic work has been done to understand the functional consequences of EV cargo within recipient cells.<br \/>Based on transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of PDAC patient-derived EVs, mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are enriched within EVs. Our lab focuses on the role of RBPs in PDAC, and thus, we will utilize enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation to identify the RBPs within PDAC EVs and evaluate their impact on the EV transcriptome. We have successfully isolated and characterized EVs via size exclusion chromatography isolation paired with western blotting for classical EV markers, fluorescent nanoparticle tracking analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. We have also demonstrated that we can identify mRNA cargoes that are bound and unbound by RBPs. Additionally, we have optimized PKH67 labeling and detection of PDAC EVs to assess specific and preferential uptake in vitro. Further, we are establishing the validated PalmGRET bioluminescent reporter in our patient derived cell lines to track PDAC EVs in a pancreatic orthotopic mouse model. Utilizing this method, we intend to identify cell types in the microenvironment that are importing PDAC EVs and perform functional studies to understand how these cells are impacted by EV signaling.<br \/>These studies will elucidate which cells in the PDAC tumor microenvironment import PDAC EVs, as well as interrogate the mechanistic role of PDAC EV crosstalk. This work will further characterize the role of RBPs in PDAC and begin to evaluate their role in a cell extrinsic manner.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e6f7ad3-12e7-4862-b99b-d16d6ae03e3e\/@C03B8ZLc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Transcriptional regulation,Tumor microenvironment,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11663"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer M.

The incidence of TE varies in different cancer types, with the highest risk in lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and in advanced-stage and metastatic cancers. Despite the benefits associated with thromboprophylaxis for symptomatic TE, the prevention of TE still remains an unmet clinical need due to lack of biomarkers predictive of TE risk and the bleeding risk associated with the routine use of anti-coagulants. Exosomes are small circulating extracellular vesicles that mediate cell-to-cell communication. Cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment release large numbers of exosomes into the blood circulation and have displayed a therapeutic and predictive value in systemic diseases. Integrins expressed on the surface of exosomes drive their selective organotropism and prepare distant sites for metastatic seeding by establishing favorable pre-metastatic niches. Here we show that exosomes from metastasis-bearing lungs or pre-metastatic lungs of mice with melanoma, breast, lung and pancreatic cancer induce TE in mice and express high levels of integrin beta 2 (ITGB2). Instead, exosomes from tumor cell lines, primary tumors or other metastasis-bearing organs did not show any pro-thrombotic properties. Myeloid cells including monocytes\/macrophages and neutrophils infiltrating pre- and post-metastatic lungs were the main source of ITGB2<sup>+<\/sup> pro-thrombotic exosomes. Blockade of ITGB2 on lung-derived exosomes, or systemically in mice, prevented exosome-induced platelet aggregation and TE, and reduced metastasis. Examination of the mechanisms of ITGB2-induced TE showed that exosomal ITGB2 interact directly or through fibrin with different binding partners on platelets, and induce their activation and aggregation. Importantly, we found that exosomal ITGB2 levels are elevated in the plasma of PDAC patients prior to TE events in comparison to PDAC patients with no history of TE, and thus might serve as prognostic biomarker of TE. Together, our results provide the first evidence of the establishment of a pro-thrombotic lung niche in different cancer types. Moreover, we identify exosomal ITGB2 as a new target for the prevention and\/or treatment of TE, as well as a potential &#8220;liquid biopsy&#8221; analyte for the early stratification of patients at high risk of TE.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fbeb15fc-fe4b-4bbf-ad55-3d6ba09cfc0d\/@C03B8ZLc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Metastasis,Immune cells,Integrins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11675"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Serena Lucotti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yusuke Ogitani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Candia M.

PDA manifests itself as a desmoplastic, myeloid cell-rich tumor with a notable paucity of T cells. Pathway analysis of the T cell low, immunotherapy resistant mouse PDA cell lines has identified the prostaglandin E<sub>2<\/sub> (PGE<sub>2<\/sub>) synthetic pathway as one of the most upregulated ones. We have previously shown that the deletion or pharmacological inhibition of COX-2, the rate-limiting PGE<sub>2<\/sub> synthesis enzyme, slows the tumor growth and synergizes with immunotherapy to further suppress PDA progression. The current study investigates how the disruption of PGE<sub>2<\/sub> signaling through its receptors, EP4 and EP2, can affect PDA. We use EP receptor genetic and pharmacological inhibition models - we disrupt EP signaling on tumor cells only or systemically, test the effects in T cell low, intermediate, and high PDA tumors, alone or in combination with chemo and immunotherapy. EP4 receptor blocker combined with the agonistic CD40 and anti-PD-1 antibodies significantly increased tumor-free survival of the T cell intermediate PDA implanted tumor-bearing (TB) mice (57% tumor-free in treated vs 0% in the control group). The same combination therapy tended to increase the survival in autochthonous tumor-bearing KrasG12D and p53R172H transgenic mice (p=0.08). CRISPR knockout (KO) of the EP4 in the T cell low cell line abolished the growth of subcutaneous (SQ) tumors and significantly slowed the progression of orthotopically implanted tumors (p=0.009 EP4 KO vs control). Treatment of the SQ T cell low TB mice with EP2\/EP4 blockers in combination with either anti-PD-1 or chemotherapy slowed the tumor growth compared to the controls (p=0.002 and p=0.004, respectively) and increased the survival (p=0.007 and p=0.002, respectively). A week of combination treatment resulted in changes in the myeloid cell compartment of the TME - an increase in the proportion of M1 macrophages and type 1 conventional dendritic cells with no significant changes in the T cell compartment. The study demonstrates an alternative approach to targeting the PGE<sub>2<\/sub> pathway in tumors and aims to develop a multiprong treatment regimen to reverse the therapy resistance in PDA.

Incidence and prevalence of RCC are rising, and 5-year survival of metastatic disease is close to 10%. The therapy of RCC mainly targets the angiogenic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), but it is rarely curative and drug resistance is almost inevitable. Lack of validated biomarkers and scarce knowledge of the biological processes occurring during RCC progression are main reasons of therapy failure. Using an immunocompetent murine model of RCC, we identified Interleukin-34 (IL34) as potential biomarker of RCC progression, whose expression is associated with advanced tumor stage and reduced survival in RCC patients. In cancer, IL34 was demonstrated to regulate cancer cell proliferation and monocytes survival and differentiation into macrophages. Regarding to RCC, IL34 role in the TME still remains elusive and has never been described. To elucidate the function of IL34 in RCC biology, we undertook different approaches: Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of IL34 co-expressed genes, using the KIRC-TCGA database, which revealed that such genes are involved in different immune system related processes; orthotopic implantation of IL34 over-expressing murine renal cancer cells (i.e. RENCA cell line) in BALB\/c mice, where we observed, both in primary tumors and lung metastases, an accumulation of tumor associated macrophages (TAM) expressing M2-type macrophage markers (e.g. Cd206 and Cd163). Subsequently, to deeply investigate how IL34 can finely tune the tumor immune microenvironment of RCC, we also employed an experiment of Single Nuclei Sequencing using murine samples over-expressing IL34 (or control empty vector). Briefly, RENCA cancer cells were implanted in BALB\/c mice using two different injection modalities: orthotopic implantation in the kidney, to generate primary tumors; 2) tail vein injection, for lung metastases formation. After tumor or metastases formation, samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed for cDNA library preparation for next generation sequencing. Our project aims to elucidate how IL34 can be implicated in the regulation of TME in RCC and, in particular, of the phenotype of the accumulated TAM. As TAM are known to promote cancer progression by enhancing tumor angiogenesis and immunosuppression, the study of IL34 role in the TME can reveal novel paradigms in RCC biology, and may be fundamental to improve the current therapy (e.g. using drugs targeting IL34 activity).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4bb77033-1902-4585-a11f-ef2b602cb7e3\/@C03B8ZLc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Renal cell carcinoma,Immuno-oncology,Interleukin-34,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11708"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrea Emanuelli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wilfried Souleyreau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiffanie Chouleur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie-Alix Derieppe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Bikfalvi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Metastatic cancer is highly fatal which contributes to at least 90% of cancer-associated morbidities and mortalities. During metastasis, tumor cells alter their signaling cascade and interact with the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment Therefore, it is necessary to characterize and understand how these cancer cells influence tumor-infiltrating immune cells to facilitate and even enhance their ability to metastasize. BRMS1 is a metastasis suppressor gene which is frequently downregulated in LUAD. We, and others, have shown that loss of BRMS1 results in distant metastatic disease. Given the strong correlation between immune suppression, metastasis, and therapy resistance we sought to elucidate if BRMS1 contributes to these processes. Specifically, we hypothesized that LUAD cells downregulate BRMS1 which influences the immune cell composition in the tumor. This creates an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment aiding in metastasis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To test our hypothesis, we generated <i>Kras<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup><i> P53<\/i><sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> <i>Brms1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice which spontaneously develop tumors with Ad-Cre intratracheal inoculation. To elucidate the role of BRMS1 in the context of cancer, we performed RNA sequencing on tumors from <i>Brms1<\/i> wild type and knockout background. We used MCP counter, an in silico cellular deconvolution algorithm on our bulk RNA seq data to identify various subsets of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Furthermore, our observations were validated by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Differential gene expression analysis using RNA seq data revealed a reduction in CXCL9, CCL5, CLEC1B, CCL9, CCL7 and other proinflammatory molecules in the <i>Brms1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> tumors. Gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis highlighted a diminished immune response signature in <i>Brms1<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>tumors. Hallmarks like interferon and IL6 signaling, complement and inflammation are highly enriched in <i>Brms1<sup>+\/+ <\/sup><\/i>tumors. MCP counter also suggested a significant increase in NK cells and reduction in CD8+ T cell population in the <i>Brms1<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>tumors. To validate our observation, we performed immunofluorescence and flow cytometry to assess the number of infiltrating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.

Here we assessed the pharmacological activity of a RIG-I agonist encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle in the B16F10 mouse syngeneic tumor model. To probe whether additional pathways may complement RIG-I agonism, we tested our compound in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors. The RIG-I agonist was administered intratumorally (IT) in B16F10 tumors. In one arm, tumors were collected four hours post treatment for cytokine analysis. In a separate arm, tumor size was measured twice a week for two weeks to assess efficacy. To understand the mechanism of action of the RIG-I agonist, high dimensional phenotyping of dissociated tumors collected at various time points was evaluated using CyTOF. Tumor-specific memory T cell response was evaluated by tumor re-challenge <i>in vivo<\/i>. Intra-tumoral dosing of the RIG-I agonist generated robust and dose-dependent production of type I IFN in the tumor that led to tumor efficacy in B16F10 model. Within 24 hours of the RIG-I agonist administration tumor infiltrating myeloid cells, NK cells, and T cells showed upregulation of activation markers such as CD69, CCR7, and Ki-67, and MHC I and PD-L1 were upregulated on CD45<sup>-<\/sup> cells. On day 10 of the treatment, the number of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and NK cells in the tumor and their expression of granzyme B increased substantially. The RIG-I agonist dosed in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies enhanced B16F10 tumor killing, including complete tumor regressions. No tumor growth was observed when these mice were re-inoculated with B16F10 cells. In conclusion, the RIG-I agonist encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle activates tumor infiltrating immune cells, promotes tumor killing, and combines favorably with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5066566c-b4e7-4d92-9da9-033f0b23ebba\/@D03B8ZLd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Interferons,Mass spectrometry,Mouse,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11712"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mark Zielstorff<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yiping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Presland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Byford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Doty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik Munsell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Craig Parish<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gretchen Baltus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lily Moy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Addona<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Zhang-Hoover<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our findings show that Pleiotrophin (PTN), a unique and previously under-studied heparin binding cytokine, contributes to inflammation within the TME. PTN appears to be particularly efficient in recruiting neutrophils, which have been reported to cause immune suppression. Consequently, inhibition of PTN pharmacologically or genetically results in lower breast cancer metastasis to lungs and better survival in multiple mouse models of breast cancer. Corroborating our mouse studies, we have found that higher PTN expression in breast cancer patient plasma correlates with poor prognosis. Concurrently, stage IV breast cancer patients that have lower PTN expression have a highly significant survival advantage (median survival 78.27 months) over patients expressing high levels of PTN (median survival 27.5 months). Additionally, we have also found PTN positive cancer cells are enriched in metastatic lesions suggesting that PTN-high cancer cells are more successful at colonizing and surviving at the secondary site. Uncovering the function of PTN in these unique cancer cells might have a major impact in the clinical setting. Overall, our data suggests that PTN is important in driving a pro-metastatic immune niche within the TME that promotes tumor cell escape from the primary tumor and survival of metastatic cancer cells in secondary sites. Additionally, our studies highlight that inhibition of PTN has potential to reduce metastatic burden in breast cancer and suggest that future studies testing the combination of PTN inhibition with standard chemotherapy or immune therapy are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8da524ad-9fac-4f09-bd51-dc8b9b5474a6\/@D03B8ZLd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Metastasis,Microenvironment,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11714"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Debolina Ganguly<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tuong V.

Understanding factors which regulate these cells could result in the identification of new approaches to enhance anti-tumor immunotherapy. One such factor is Epidermal growth factor-like 6 (EGFL6). EGFL6 is a secreted factor known to promote cancer stem like cell migration and regulate cancer cell differentiation. Similarly, EGFL6 promotes endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Indicating a potential role for EGFL6 as a myeloid cell regulatory factor, we found that mice which overexpress <i>Egfl6<\/i> have an increased numbers of granulocytes and monocytes in both the bone marrow and spleen. In vitro and ex-vivo analysis indicated that EGFL6, via binding with beta integrins and activation of Syk\/ERK signaling, (i) acts as a chemotactic factor for human myeloid cells migration and (ii) promotes their differentiation toward a suppressive state. Suggesting an important role in promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), using two syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer, we found that expression of Egfl6 in tumor cells resulted in increased accumulation of intra-tumoral MDSCs and TAMs and fewer cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. This was associated with increased tumor growth and shortened animal survival. Gene expression profiling and flow cytometry analysis of tumor infiltrating myeloid cells indicated that Egfl6 induced the expression of immunosuppressive factors, including CXCL2, IL-10 and PD-L1. Consistent with Egfl6 driving an immune suppressive TME, EGFL6 expression in an otherwise immune &#8216;hot&#8217;\/anti-PD-L1 responsive tumor model completely inhibited response to anti-PD-L-1 therapy. We are currently evaluating the impact of Egfl6 neutralizing antibody on the efficacy of ICI therapy and anti-tumor immunity. Combined our data show that EGFL6 acts as a chemotactic factor to both recruit myeloid cells to the ovarian TME and subsequently promotes their differentiation to an immunosuppressive phenotype. This suggests EGFL6 is a potential novel therapeutic target to ovarian tumor mediated immunosuppression and enhance response to immune therapy in ovarian cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9134a65d-bc63-4786-8cf7-1a973721abd0\/@D03B8ZLd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Macrophages,Immune checkpoint blockade,EGFL6,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11716"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sarah Sinno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shoumei Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Coronnello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anda Vlad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald J.

Our studies show that the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease-6 (USP6) can induce an immune-stimulatory hot tumor microenvironment in Ewing sarcoma (ES), the 2nd most common pediatric bone cancer. High USP6 expression in ES is associated with significantly improved overall and progression-free survival. We found that USP6 expression in ES cells inhibits xenograft growth in nude mice, but not NSG mice, implicating a role for the innate immune system, particularly cytotoxic NK cells. Notably, USP6 expression enhanced intra-tumoral abundance, activation, and proliferative capacity of NK cells.<i> <\/i><i>In<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity assays confirm that USP6 can directly augment the ability of ES cells to activate NK cells. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that NK cells are essential for USP6-mediated tumor suppression and seek to determine the mechanism by which their cytolytic function is activated by USP6.<br \/><b>METHOD:<\/b> We used ES cell lines A673 and RD-ES expressing USP6 in a doxycycline (dox)-inducible manner, the immortalized human NK cell line NK-92, and primary human and mouse NK cells. Athymic nude or RAG2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice were xenografted subcutaneously with ES cell lines and fed dox-infused water to induce USP6. Immune cell abundance and activation were monitored both in tumors and peripheral blood by flow cytometry. For<i> in vivo<\/i> depletion of NK cells, 300ug of anti-NK1.1 (PK136) ab was injected i.p. into RAG2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice one day prior to ES xenografting, then once weekly thereafter.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> USP6 induces in ES cells the surface expression of multiple NK activating ligands, as well as receptors for the apoptotic factor TRAIL (DR5) and Type I\/II interferons (IFNAR1 and IFNGR1), both<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vitro<\/i> and<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vivo<\/i>. This leads to enhanced NK activation and renders ES cells hypersensitive to NK-mediated cytotoxicity. IFNy released by activated NK cells feeds back on the USP6-expressing ES cells, inducing synergistic expression of multiple IFNy-inducible genes, including chemokines CXCL9\/10 (chemoattractants for NK cells) and ICAM-1 (essential for immunological synapse formation between NK cells and their targets). A potent feed forward loop for NK activation\/ES cell killing is thus generated. Concordantly, in RAG2-\/- mice, USP6 induces increased intratumoral infiltration and activation of NK cells, and also, strikingly, systemic activation of NK cells. Depletion of NK cells using anti-NK1.1(PK136) completely abrogates USP6-mediated inhibition of ES xenograft growth.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> NK cells are essential for mediating the tumor inhibitory functions of USP6 in ES. We posit that USP6&#8217;s ability to activate NK cells both intratumorally and systemically underlies its association with improved ES patient prognosis, which we seek to exploit for therapeutic benefit in future studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55e40ddc-e74b-4234-8c6f-32bf78f3f509\/@D03B8ZLd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Tumor microenvironment,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11717"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kanika Jain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian C.
