[{"Abstract":"Background: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) alterations are commonly found 14-20% patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. FGFR inhibition has been investigated for more than 7 years on clinical trials. More recently, pemigatinib and infigratinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of FGFR 1, 2, and 3 received approval from the FDA in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions\/rearrangements in the second-line setting. There are limited data about evolution of mutational profiles post progression from FGFR2 inhibition.<br \/>Methods: Clinical outcomes data and mutational profiles were obtained from a retrospective database collected via an institutional DNA sequencing panel including tissue sequencing and cell free DNA (cfDNA), Foundation One, Guardant360, and Tempus. A total of 102 patients treated at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2013 - 2021 with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 fusions (91 patients) and rearrangements (11) were analyzed.<br \/>Results: Female 55 (54%) and male 47 (46%) patients; 99 patients had stage IV, 3 patients with stage IIIB at initiation of FGFR inhibition; median age, 59. Out of 91 patients with FGFR2 fusions, there were 52 different fusion partners: BICC1, AHCYL1, TACC2, and NOL4 with 24, 5, 4, and 3 patients, respectively. Forty two (42) patients with FGFR2 fusions and 9 patients with FGFR2 rearrangements received FGFR inhibitors: these include infigratinib (13), pemigatinib (17), futibatinib (14), derazantinib (5), and zoligratinib (2). Out of 51 patients, 14 (28%) patients received FGFR inhibition in the front-line setting, 15 (29%) and 22 (43%) received one prior, two\/more (2 - 6), respectively. The median progression-free survival in 51 patients was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.2 - 10.3), and median overall survival was 24.7 months (95% CI, 15.9 - 33.2). Eighteen (18) patients with FGFR2 fusions have mutational profiles before and post-progression on FGFR2 inhibition: 15 (83%) patients showed no more FGFR2 fusions; 3 patients showed the same fusions after progression. New FGFR alterations post-progression included FGFR1_K139I, FGFR2_N549K (2 patients), FGFR2_N549H, FGFR2_V564F, FGFR2 fusion with SYNPO2. New gene mutations that did not exist before FGFR inhibition but developed post progression included PIK3CA (2 patients), APC (2 patients), BRAF V600E\/A694T, NRAS, BAP1, GNAS, TP53, and other mutations.<br \/>Conclusion: The genomic evolution post-progression on FGFR inhibition involves acquired resistance in multiple pathways. Targeting co-alterations acquired post-progression with drug combination may overcome these resistance mechanisms and potentiate the efficacy of FGFR inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  (FGFR-2),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15935"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Brent B.

Treatment of SCLC has not considerably changed over the last decades with therapeutic options focusing on unselected populations. Although in the past SCLC was thought to be a relatively homogenous malignancy, recent reports from our group and others identified four major distinct subgroups of SCLC, each with different therapeutic vulnerabilities. Three of the subtypes are defined by the expression of a specific transcription factor, ASCL1 (SCLC-A), NEUROD1 (SCLC-N) and POU2F3 (SCLC-P) while the fourth subtype is defined by an inflamed phenotype (SCLC-I). While our initial subtyping of SCLC is based on a gene expression signature comprised of ~1300 genes, which makes routine implementation challenging, we hypothesized that DNA methylation as a proxy to gene expression might be a more suitable approach for biomarker development in SCLC. We assembled a cohort of 105 SCLC formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples (82\/105 Stage <u>&#62;<\/u> IIIb) and performed matched RNA-Sequencing (RNAseq) and methylation profiling using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). To validate our findings and expand our analysis across different sample types, we profiled a panel of 59 fully characterized SCLC cell lines as well as 68 patient-derived xenograft models. We found that methylation levels differ markedly between the four subtypes, with the SCLC-N presenting with a hypermethylated phenotype and the SCLC-P with a hypomethylated phenotype across the genome, highlighting the profound differences in the underlying epigenetic regulation among the SCLC subtypes and supporting DNA methylation analysis as a potential readout for identifying SCLC subtypes. Furthermore, in order to subtype the clinical SCLC samples, we developed a predictive model using an extreme gradient boost model using RNA expression and DNA methylation, respectively, to allow the classification with 94.5% accuracy in the tissue testing cohort. Using a cohort of matched plasma samples, we further demonstrated that the DNA methylation differences were indeed preserved in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) allowing subtype classification with an accuracy of 87.5%. These data indicate that DNA methylation can be used for reliable subtyping of SCLC in tissue and in liquid biopsy samples. In summary, using a large cohort of predominantly extensive stage SCLC clinical samples, we were able to identify profound differences in DNA methylation that can be exploited as a novel biomarker for the classification of SCLC into four distinct subtypes with both tissue biopsy and non-invasive using plasma. Considering the previously shown therapeutic vulnerabilities of the four subtypes, these findings will enable the rapid initiation of personalized clinical trials in SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2cc21617-7881-4591-b8f0-c6576877f738\/@r03B8ZC6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Liquid biopsies,Machine learning,Diagnosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15936"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Simon Heeke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carl M.

In multivariable Cox regression models, patients with <i>RAS <\/i>mutated-only tumors exhibit a nearly non-lethal disease course compared to other molecular subtypes, including <i>TP53 <\/i>mutated-only tumors (hazard ratio for death: 75.6, p&#60;0.001). Inclusion of tumor molecular subtype in conventional multivariable models improves model prognostic strength. In addition, MAAP-derived molecular subtypes prognosticate patient survival in a separate cohort of 248 patients with right-sided, mismatch-repair-proficient metastatic colorectal cancer.<br \/>Molecular characterization of AC also reveals differences in tumor biology and behavior. In addition to an improved prognosis, <i>RAS<\/i> mutated-only MAAP tumors exhibit significantly lower tumor mutational quantity and aneuploidy compared to other subtypes in multivariable models (p&#60;0.001). Together with clonality patterns, this suggests that <i>RAS <\/i>mutated-only tumors exhibit a relatively younger molecular age. In a subset of patients with MAAP who underwent cytoreductive surgery, patients with <i>RAS<\/i>-only tumors demonstrate significantly lower intra-operative assessed peritoneal cancer indices (PCI) compared to patients with other molecular subtypes (p=0.049). Microscopic assessment of surgical samples reveals that <i>RAS <\/i>mutated-only tumors are significantly less likely (p&#60;0.001) to exhibit destructive metastatic stromal invasion compared to <i>GNAS <\/i>and <i>TP53 <\/i>mutated subtypes.

While local recurrence and overall survival are useful metrics for analyzing genomic risk factors in LACC, such time to event analysis can be complicated by confounding variables which impede the elucidation of biologically relevant signals. Our group previously reported upregulation of genes from the PI3K pathway in cervical tumors with residual abnormal 18F-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) performed 3 months after CRT. Here, we analyzed whole transcriptome data using RNASeq from N=86 prospectively collected pretreatment cervix tumor biopsies to identify novel gene expression signatures associated with persistent or new FDG uptake on 3 month post-therapy FDG-PET.<br \/>Objective:<b> <\/b>To<b> <\/b>identify and validate a predictive gene expression signature able to distinguish primary tumors likely to be resistant to standard of care CRT as assessed by PET scan obtained 3-months following completion of therapy.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>Whole tumor RNA-seq analysis was performed on 86 pre-treatment tumor specimens and compared with associated 3-month post-CRT FDG-PET. Response was dichotomized into metabolic complete response (mCR) and persistent\/new disease (mP\/N) defined as persistent or new areas of FDG-uptake on post-CRT PET per the nuclear medicine report. Differential expression analysis was conducted using the EdgeR R-package. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using reference libraries as specified and EnrichR software. Decision tree modeling, hyperparameter optimization, and k-fold cross-validation was performed using the sci-kitlearn python package.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>We identified an 18-gene expression signature predictive for mCR vs. mP\/N in patients treated with definitive CRT with an overall prospective accuracy of 0.92. This model reliably identified both classes of patients (mCR F1=0.95, precision = 0.90, recall =1.0 ; mP\/N F1=0.80, precision 0.67, recall =1.0). Crowd source enrichment analysis using EnrichR identified an NRF2 driven expression program (p=0.0006), and an altered inflammatory response (0.000006) within the predictive 18 gene signature.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>We generated an 18-gene model to predict response to CRT as assessed by 3 month PET imaging. This novel expression signature further identified the NRF2 transcription factor as an important marker for resistance to CRT, consistent with previous studies showing NRF2 promotes cervical cancer growth. Our findings highlight the need for further elucidation of the NRF2 pathway in LACC, and can be used to accurately assess high risk patients who would benefit from treatment escalation. <b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/341b57e6-c176-495f-b324-9cf5f0ac2de1\/@r03B8ZC6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Tumor staging: Correlation of clinical and molecular markers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Molecular markers,Radioresistance,Nrf2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15961"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael R.

Here, we characterized the effects of the dual RAF\/MEK inhibitor VS-6766 and the FAK inhibitor defactinib on signal transduction and viability in LGSOC cell lines and patient-derived organoids. To correlate molecular characteristics with clinical response, we characterized genomic alterations in archival tumor samples from patients with LGSOC treated with the combination of VS-6766 and defactinib on a clinical trial (FRAME).<br \/><b>Material and Methods: <\/b>We exposed 5 LGSOC cell lines to clinical Cmax concentrations adjusted for protein binding of VS-6766 and defactinib. We quantified phospho- and total proteins (n=66) with an antibody-bead based assay normalized to GAPDH. We also studied growth inhibitory effects of the combination on KRAS mutant (mt) LGSOC patient-derived organoids. We performed next generation sequencing on archival samples from LGSOC patients treated with VS-6766 in combination with defactinib.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Signal transduction changes at 1 hr included reduction of p-FAK in 5\/5 cell lines in response to defactinib. Cells exposed to VS-6766 showed a reduction in p-ERK and p-p90-RSK in 4\/5 cell lines. Additionally, VS-6766 decreased p-cJUN and increased p-I&#954;B in 4\/5 cell lines, changes correlated with apoptosis. At 24 hrs, p-ERK and p-p90-RSK inhibition were maintained in 3\/5 cell lines. Both drugs increased cleaved PARP in 4\/5 cell lines and VS-6766 increased p-SMAD3 and BIM levels, indicating an increase in cell death\/apoptosis. The combination of VS-6766 + defactinib showed synergistic growth inhibition in a KRAS mt LGSOC organoid model (combination index 0.51). The clinical combination of VS-6766 and defactinib (September 2021 cut-off) has shown an objective response rate (ORR) of 11\/24 (46%) across all patients with LGSOC, and an ORR of 64% (7\/11) for patients with KRAS mt LGSOC (n=11). In addition to mutations in <i>KRAS<\/i>, emerging data may suggest a correlation of U2AF1 and MED12 mutations with response.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>VS-6766, the dual RAF\/MEK inhibitor, induces significant inhibition of ERK pathway signaling in addition to perturbations in TNF\/NF&#954;B signaling. Both defactinib and VS-6766 induce apoptosis in LGSOC models. The results provide mechanistic insights into the encouraging response rates observed in patients with LGSOC treated with VS-6766 and defactinib (NCT03875820). These data support the ongoing randomized phase II ENGOTov60\/GOG3052\/RAMP201 study (NCT04625270).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/21dafc88-42a0-40db-baf7-9c4f831f12c3\/@r03B8ZC6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Proteomics,KRAS,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15940"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Adam R.

To improve patients&#8217; comfort this fluid is removed via chest draining, and the recovered liquid is generally considered as biological waste. Here, we aim to develop an optimized protocol for single-cell sequencing of floating cells in pleural effusion from advanced-stage cancer patients. To date, pleural effusion samples have been obtained from treatment-na&#239;ve, advanced-stage cancer patients (lung n= 8, breast n= 3; ovary n=4, others n=4). After red blood cell lysis, 768 cells\/sample were isolated using the image-based cellenONE technology. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed using SORT-seq. Bioinformatic analysis was done using an in-house pipeline on cells passing these filters: &#62;200 detected genes per cell, &#62;500 UMIs per cell, &#60;25% of UMIs mapping on mitochondrial genes and &#60;20% of spike-in reads. Pleural samples exhibited very heterogeneous data quality, which was reflected in a marked difference in the quality control (Qc) metrics between the samples but was not influenced by tumor type. After Qc filtering, the median number of analyzable cells\/sample (mNAC) was 153 [5 - 460], for which the median number of expressed genes\/cell per sample (mNEG) was 2,431 [1,022 - 4,026]. The time elapsed between patient sample collection and the initiation of single-cell sorting likely impacted data quality (&#62;3h: mNAC: 99; mNEG: 1,553) compared to samples processed more rapidly (&#60;3h: mNAC: 169; mNEG: 2,492), although not reaching statistical significance. A higher isolation frequency and recovery rate during single-cell sorting resulted in the capture of higher quality cells. The duration of single-cell isolation varied between 11&#8217; and 100&#8217; (median: 21&#8217;) and was dependent on the initial cell concentration. No significant differences were observed in terms of cell diameter or elongation with regards to cancer type. However, cell diameter was correlated with mNAC. For cell type inference, we used SingleR with the Human Pan-Cancer Atlas database as reference. Epithelial cells were the most predominant cell type in these samples, followed by subpopulations of monocytes and macrophages. A combination of the &#8220;mean variance&#8221; and &#8220;rank based&#8221; methods was used to obtain the list of the most variable genes, to define expression clusters and discern samples by cancer type. Calculation of the enrichment of transcriptomic signatures and therapy response signatures (<i>i.e.<\/i>, IFN-gamma) was used to apprehend the potential biological differences between samples and cell subpopulations. Results will be presented at the conference. This protocol is currently applicable to analyze floating cells from pleural effusions and is expected to provide a complementary source for the molecular profiling of advanced-stage cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Gene expression analysis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15944"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sandra Ortiz-Cuaran<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucas Michon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marion Godefroy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joyce Levy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Osman Osman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxime Boussageon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurélie Swalduz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maurice Pérol<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruno Russias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>François Monjaret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre Saintigny<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have demonstrated that the molecular landscape of AML in children is distinct, and co-occurrence of variants modulate outcomes. Recent discovery of tandem duplication (TD) of the UBTF gene in AML, with enrichment in FLT3-ITD has implicated yet another mutation whose cooperation with FLT3-ITD may modify outcome. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of UBTF-TD in <i>de novo<\/i> AML and define its clinical implications within FLT3-ITD patients. Initial interrogation of transcriptome data from 1,158 children enrolled on COG AAML1031 identified 50 cases of UBTF-TD (4.3%). Overwhelming majority of UBTF-TD cases were observed in FLT3-ITD cases (77%), vs. that of 1.2% in those without FLT3-ITD (p&#60;0.001). Given extreme enrichment of UBTF-TD in FLT3-ITD, we inquired whether cooperation of UBTF-TD and FLT3-ITD creates a distinct clinical entity. To this end we screened diagnostic DNA from 400 FLT3-ITD patients treated on three consecutive CCG\/COG trials (COG AAML1031, COG AAML0531, and CCG-2961) by PCR and fragment analysis. UBTF-TD was identified in 61 FLT3-ITD cases (15.3%).<br \/>The data presented here forth focuses on evaluation of implications of UBTF-TD in FLT3-ITD positive patients only. Within the FLT3-ITD patients, initial correlation of UBTF-TD with demographics, disease characteristics, and associated genomic variants was conducted. Patients with and without UBTF-TD had a similar median age at diagnosis (p=0.322), lower diagnostic WBC (p=0.010) and higher marrow blast % (p&#60;0.001). There was a stark paucity of cooperating variants that commonly co-occur with FLT3-ITD, with a single NPM1 mutation (1.6% vs. 29%, p&#60;0.001) and no NUP98 fusions (0% vs. 23%, p&#60;0.001). There was a significant enrichment of WT1 mutations, with 45% UBTF-TD patients with a WT1 mutation (FLT3-ITD\/UBTF-TD\/WT1), vs. 11% in UBTF-WT (p&#60;0.001). Trisomy 8 (Tri8) was seen in 15% of UBTF-TD. Patients with UBTF-TD had a lower CR rate (44% vs. 60%, p = 0.018), and Higher MRD rate (38% vs. 21%, p&#60;0.001). Patients with and without UBTF-TD had an EFS of 28% vs. 42% (p=0.047) with a corresponding OS of 40% and 57% (p=0.019). Given enrichment of WT1 mutations and Tri8 in patients with UBTF-TD, we studied the outcome UBTF-TD patients in the context of these two variants. FLT3-ITD\/UBTF-TD\/WT1 patients had a 5-year EFS of 17% vs. 38% for similar patients without WT1 mutations (p=0.0062). Patients with UBTF-TD with additional Tri8 had a similarly poor outcome with an EFS of 23% with a corresponding OS of 33%, providing a distinct high risk UBTF-TD cohort (+WT1 or Tri8), whereas the remaining UBTF-TD patients had a more favorable outcome with EFS and OS of 64% and 86%, respectively (p&#60;0.0001, and p&#60;0.0001). UBTF-TD is a novel genomic entity with high enrichment in patients with FLT3-ITD and a distinct clinical outcome driven by cooperating WT1 mutation and Tri8.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dce30cc2-2f26-478b-827a-47a5ad7f7b14\/@r03B8ZC6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Acute myeloid leukemia,Mutations,FLT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15945"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Leila Robinson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Leonti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todd A.

Phase 1b clinical study (RPT835GC1B) met its primary endpoints and recommended phase 2 dose was described early. Here, we present pharmacokinetics (PK) and results of biomarker analysis.<br \/>Alofanib was administered daily intravenously for 5-days followed by a 2-day interval (rest). There were five dose levels using a 3&#8201;+&#8201;3 design. 21 patients have been enrolled in the study. Patients were Caucasian (100%), predominantly male (71%), 67% had 2 and more metastatic sites, including liver (43%) and bone (14.3%) metastases, 19% had ECOG PS 2, and were heavily pretreated (86% had previous 3 and more lines of therapy). The PK and biomarker analysis set included 18 patients. FGFR2 amplification was accessed by FISH with ZytoLight SPEC FGFR2\/CEN 10 Dual Color Probe and FGFR2 expression was accessed by IHC with antibody 1G3 (Abcam (ab 5820).<br \/>Table summarizes PK data. The geometric mean values of Cmax, AUC0-t, T1\/2, Vd increased and CL, Kel decreased approximately dose-proportionally after single dosing, similar to previous preclinical studies. The decrease in the mean value of the Vd for a dose of 350 mg\/m2 may be associated with a significant increase in AUC0-t. No correlations between PK values and objective response rate (n=2; 9.5%), progression-free (median 3.63 months (95% CI, 1.58 - 5.68) and overall (median 7.0 months (3.82 - 10.18) survival as well as in patients with liver metastases were found (all P&#62;0.1). A positive FGFR2 IHC expression was observed in all tumor cells and a weak positive reaction in normal epithelium. FGFR2 amplification was confirmed by FISH in 1 (5.6%) patient.Alofanib PK in a gastric patient population is well characterized, supporting the use of a once-daily 350 mg\/m2 dose. In further studies, the evaluation of FGFR2 amplification seems to be important.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{D14A8EBD-53DC-4E05-9613-CFD289C10866}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Cohort 1<br><\/b><b>50 mg\/m2<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><div><b>Cohort 2 <br><\/b><\/div><div><b>1<\/b><b>00 mg\/m2<\/b><\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Cohort 3<br><\/b><b>165 mg\/m2<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Cohort 4<br><\/b><b>250 mg\/m2<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Cohort 5<br><\/b><b>350 mg\/m2<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Cmax<\/b><b>, <\/b>mcg\/ml (CV%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21.4 (32.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23.7 (18.4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">44.7 (15.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">72.8 (64.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">145.9 (42.7)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>AUC0-t, <\/b>mcg*h\/ml (CV%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.3 (31.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.6 (14.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.3 (49.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23.8 (8.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">74.0 (57.5)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Vd<\/b><b>, <\/b>ml\/m2 (CV%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4006.1 (28.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4907.5 (14.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5676.8 (26.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6686.7 (11)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3823.0 (63.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>CL<\/b><b>, <\/b>ml\/h\/m2 (SD)<b> <\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19609.5 (7740)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14028.2 (1990)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11910.5 (8740)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10011.0 (827)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4183.0 (2420)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Kel<\/b><b>, <\/b>1\/h (CV%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.9 (15.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.9 (2.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.1 (41.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.5 (3.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.1 (47.0)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>T1\/2<\/b>, h (SD)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.1 (0.024)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.2 (0.01)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.3 (0.118)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.5 (0.0171)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.6 (0.293)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aee19c5f-42c4-4ddd-83fa-1317e5e8ad2f\/@r03B8ZC6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  (FGFR-2),Small molecule inhibitor,Gastric cancer,allosteric,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15947"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Grigory Raskin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vasily Kazey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svetlana Gorbacheva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aiyyna Nikiforova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Galina Statsenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Artamonova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liubov Vladimirova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalia Besova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anastasia Mochalova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Rykov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vladimir Moiseyenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Utyashev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergei Iugai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadezhda Dragun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitry Reznikov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evgenia Gavrilova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergei Tjulandin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilya Tsimafeyeu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Studies also suggest that metformin could complement PD-1 blockade and potentiate its antitumor activity. Previously we reported the results of a phase II trial with metformin and nivolumab and here we report the findings of correlative analysis of the prospectively collected research samples of 18 patients.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a phase II trial with nivolumab and metformin in treatment-refractory microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks and metformin 1000 mg orally twice daily was administered in 28-day cycles following a 14-day metformin only lead-in phase. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Pre-treatment and on-treatment research biopsies and correlative peripheral blood specimens were collected. Paired biopsies obtained at baseline and following treatment with metformin only (n=9) or metformin and nivolumab (n=9) and were stained with a panel of 13 markers using ChipCytometry technology by Canopy Biosciences. Sample was assessed prior to establishing the multiplex assay. 30 out of 36 samples were imaged and analyzed up to 30 Fields of View. Single cell recognition and quantitative biomarker analysis were performed to compare immune cell numbers and population distribution in pre- versus post-treatment samples.<br \/>Results: As previously reported, no patients had objective response based on RECIST version 1.1 and the study was stopped after the first stage for futility. Median OS and PFS was 5.1 months [95% CI (2-11.7)] and 2.3 months [95% CI (1.7-2.4)], respectively. Multiplex analysis of tissues from patients receiving lead in with metformin alone revealed fewer effector CD4 T cells and effector and effector memory CD8 T cells after treatment vs. baseline biopsy. Biopsy tissue from patients treated with metformin and nivolumab had lower pAMPK and decreased PDL-1 expression vs. baseline. The combination also increased percentages of leukocytes, effector CD4 T cells, effector and effector memory CD8 T cells as well as levels of PDL1<sup>-<\/sup>Tim3<sup>+<\/sup> cells.<br \/>Conclusion: In the setting of MSS mCRC, metformin as a single agent did not enhance effector CD4 and CD8 T cell percentages in clinical samples in our patient cohort. Metformin in combination with nivolumab was associated with increased percentages of effector CD4 and CD8 T cells in biopsy specimens, although these improvements did not translate into enhanced clinical endpoints. Analysis of peripheral blood samples are currently underway to corroborate the findings in the tissue samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a28f5189-f285-4074-9de8-160bbeb1b4ab\/@s03B8ZC7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Combination therapy,Immunomodulation,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15948"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Batoul Farran<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey M.

Whereas single-cell RNA-sequencing of clinical tumor biopsies requires immediate processing after tissue acquisition, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) allows profiling of single nuclei isolated from frozen tumor tissue from patients with long-term follow-up and known clinical outcomes.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed snRNA-seq of frozen tumors from 48 bladder cancer (BC) patients (10 Ta, 13 T1, 25 T2-4) using an optimized DroNc-seq protocol. Nuclei were isolated from frozen biopsies using IgePal lysis buffer and droplets were created using the Dolomite Bio platform followed by library generation and sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. All epithelial nuclei were classified according to the UROMOL classes of non-muscle-invasive BC or the consensus classes of muscle-invasive BC. Bulk total RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was available for 44 of the tumors for comparison. Three tumors were additionally analyzed using 10x Chromium for validation and four tumors were analyzed using 10x Visium Spatial Transcriptomics.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>After pre-processing the raw sequencing data, we obtained data from 117,653 nuclei in total and 59,201 nuclei remained after quality control filtering (1,233 nuclei per tumor and 529 expressed genes per nuclei on average). We focused our analysis on the epithelial compartment, as it constituted the bulk of the tumors (99% of all nuclei). UMAP visualization and clustering of all tumors were mainly driven by patient origin indicating a high level of inter-tumor heterogeneity. To explore intra-tumor heterogeneity and the association to disease aggressiveness, we characterized the tumors individually using hallmark BC gene signatures. Finally, we explored the composition of transcriptomic classes for each tumor and found that 52% of tumors displayed profound intra-tumor class heterogeneity with less than 70% of all nuclei belonging to a single class. The dominating transcriptomic class of single nuclei was only consistent in 44% of the tumors when compared to the overall transcriptomic class from bulk RNA-seq. This may be explained by several levels of heterogeneity and method differences, including the technical challenges of applying a bulk classifier to single nuclei data. We are currently investigating whether specific epithelial subpopulations are associated to outcome and whether signatures derived from snRNA-seq data can be recovered in bulk RNA-seq data and used as prognostic predictors.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our results highlight the biological complexity of bladder tumors and underline the importance of considering the extent of intra-tumor heterogeneity in the clinical management of BC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/18e2a415-5cb0-4016-a8a7-d5a64af1c614\/@s03B8ZC7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Tumor heterogeneity,Molecular subtypes,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15949"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sia V.

The custom assay performance was compared to standard clinical BC biomarker assays (e.g.ER, PR, HER2, Ki67) across the spectrum of BC subtypes and in multiple laboratories. Commercially available antibodies to 27 BC-related protein biomarkers, including ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67, AR, immune-related (e.g. PD-L1) and several cell cycle\/proliferation markers were oligonucleotide-tagged, and verified by immunohistochemistry for performance against untagged antibodies. The tagged antibodies were combined with 3 isotype controls and 2 housekeeping proteins into a custom BC high-plex assay for DSP. Confirmation of target specificity was done on a custom tissue microarray (TMA) (Run control) composed of (un)treated cancer cell lines and normal tissues. For clinical BC samples, each biopsy had 4x600 &#181;m regions of interest segmented into pan-Cytokeratin+ tumoral epithelium and pan-Cytokeratin- adjacent stroma segments. With targeted UV light, oligonucleotides were collected from each segment sequentially and quantitated with nCounter. Raw counts were geomean normalized for analysis. Intra-site and inter-site assay reproducibility was assessed with the TMA and serial FFPE sections from BC biopsies. Quantitation of proteins showed high reproducibility within sites (e.g. Run 1 v. Run 2, p&#62;0.05 for all protein targets) and the high-plex custom assay showed good concordance between 3 participating laboratories. GeoMx DSP-derived protein data correlated well with orthogonal methodologies performed on a sample subset including immunohistochemistry, reverse phase protein array, DNA and RNA-sequencing. For example, DSP protein counts for p53 protein were higher in tumors with TP53 point mutation than those with truncating TP53 alterations. Expanded sample testing is underway with 120 well-characterized breast cancer biopsies of various histologies, immune subtypes (e.g. TIL scores) and clinical biomarker phenotypes (e.g. ER+\/HER2-\/Ki-67 high BC; ER+\/HER2-\/Ki-67 low BC; HER2+ BC; ER-\/PR-\/HER2- BC).Our preliminary data demonstrate that this custom high-plex BC assay can quantitate protein biomarkers across a wide dynamic range with high intra-lab and inter-lab reproducibility. The assay requirement of a single 5-&#181;m tissue section facilitates complex biomarker profiling in biopsies with limited material. The custom assay alone or in combination with other targeted DSP protein modules can simultaneously interrogate the biomarker profile, immune-based and other drug target profile, and immune microenvironment of BC specimens, providing a novel approach for actionable tumor subtyping.

The current classification relies solely on clinical features and does not explain the heterogeneity that exists within each of these conditions. To shed light on the biology that may account for the clinical differences, we used bone marrow (BM) CD19+\/CD138+ sorted cells and matched BM plasma from 32 patients (pts) (7 IgM MGUS, 25 WM) and 5 healthy controls to perform the first comprehensive multiomics approach including whole exome sequencing, RNA seq, proteomics and metabolomics. Applying principal component analysis to gene expression profiling, most of WM pts clustered together, while a small subset of them grouped separately with MGUS pts, suggesting a biologic dichotomy within WM. The healthy controls formed a distinct group from most WM and MGUS. We then applied a non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering to the gene expression data and identified three robust clusters. Cluster 1 (C1) included only WM pts, cluster 2 (C2) included both WM and MGUS pts, and cluster 3 (C3) included all controls as well as a small number of WM and MGUS pts. When mutations commonly identified in WM were analyzed, there was no difference among the three groups (excluding controls) in mutation burden of MYD88 L265P and CXCR4. Interestingly, aberrant expression of TNFAIP3 seemed a distinct feature of C1 as deletion of 6q (which encodes for TNFAIP3) and TNFAIP3 mutations were each significantly enriched in C1 (47%) compared to C2 (0%) and C3 (20%; p=0.04). Individual clusters associated with specific transcriptional signature and clinical features. While C1 displayed enrichment of cell growth, downregulation of inflammatory pathways (eg IL6 and IL8 signaling) and aggressive behavior, C2 showed increased inflammatory signaling and cell survival with indolent behavior. C3 had an intermediate feature with combined proliferative and inflammatory signatures. In accordance with the transcriptomic data, the hallmark of C1 was upregulation of proliferation-associated proteins (eg AKT, MAPK) and downregulation of inflammatory proteins (eg IL4, IL10) while the opposite was observed in C2. Once more, C3 confirmed intermediate features with combined upregulation of proliferation and inflammatory proteins. The metabolism was rewired towards fatty acid catabolism in C1, glycolysis in C2 and anabolism in C3. Accordingly, C1 showed undetectable concentration of 3-hydroxybutyric acid as opposed to C2 which had increased levels of malic and lactic acids, as end products of fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis respectively. Those metabolites had intermediate levels in C3. In conclusion, we identified three molecular clusters with distinct clinical, proteomic and metabolomic features, suggesting a potential biologic classification that may have therapeutic implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/19dd4427-5492-4715-b10e-5cf083aae731\/@s03B8ZC7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Molecular profiling,Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia,IgM gammopathies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15951"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patrizia Mondello<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Paludo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Novak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerstin Wenzl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shahrzad Jalali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Krull<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Esteban Braggio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Surendra Dasari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Manske<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jithma Abeykoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asher Chanan-Khan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Kyle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morie Gertz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhi Zhang Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Novak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Ansell<\/i><\/presenter>.

They have been associated with both pro-tumor and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we reported increased expression and secretion levels of CXCL1, 2 and 8 in oxaliplatin (OXA)-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of measuring the serum levels of a CXC chemokine panel in CRC patients as prognostic and \/ or predictive biomarkers of first-line treatment.<br \/><b>Material and Methods: <\/b>In this multicenter study sera from advanced CRC patients to be treated with OXA-based schedules were collected at three different time points between November 2016 and June 2021: before treatment (PRET), at first response evaluation (EVAR) and at the time of progression\/end of study (PROG). Levels of CXCL1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 chemokines were analyzed using a custom Bio-plex Pro Human assay (Bio-Rad, USA) in a Luminex&#174; 200 equipment. Comparisons of chemokines&#8217; levels between Responders (R) and Non-Responders (NR) at different time-points were carried out using the Mann Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests. Log Rank and Cox regression were used to study differences in progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS); Chi-square or Fisher&#8217;s tests were used to study associations between categorical variables. All differences were considered statistically significant when p values &#8804; 0.05.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 107 patients were enrolled in this study: 72% male; median age 66 years old; metastasis: 78% liver, 41% lung; mutations: 44% KRAS, 4% BRAF; treatments: FOLFOX\/XELOX = 30%\/4% plus Bevacizumab\/anti-EGFR = 36%\/24%; 64% responders (complete response + partial response); 13% stable disease; 11% progressors. All chemokines could be detected in the samples. Levels below median (LBM) of CXCL1, 8, 11 and 13 correlated with better OS (HR=0.55 p=0.02; HR=0.47 p=0.005; HR=0.6 p=0.05; HR=0.54 p=0.02, respectively). LBM of CXCL16 correlated with better OS and PFS (HR=0.6 p=0.04; HR=0.6 p=0.005) and of CXCL5 with better PFS (HR 0.6 p 0.011); mean CXCL9 levels were lower in responders&#8217; PRET samples (p=0.03) and LBM correlated with better OS (HR=0.5 p=0.019). In responders, all chemokines except CXCL10, 13 and 16 presented decreased levels at EVAR vs. PRET. Moreover, CXCL1, 2, 5, 8, 11 and 16 levels increased at PROG vs. EVAR. In non-responders, non-conclusive results were found.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> our results show that serum levels of specific CXC chemokines may be used as prognostic\/predictive markers in metastatic CRC.

The well-differentiated (WD) and de-differentiated (DD) subtypes of LPS are associated with indolent and aggressive disease courses, respectively, but this histologic stratification fails to fully capture disease heterogeneity. Molecular approaches may help refine prognostication and inform treatment intensification. Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3 or IMP3), is an RNA-binding protein that regulates gene expression by controlling mRNA stability and has been implicated in tumorigenesis and poor prognosis in many cancers. We hypothesized IGF2BP3 would refine the prognostication of LPS beyond its WD\/DD histologic status.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We examined the association between IGF2BP3 gene or protein expression and clinical data in four datasets: (1) patients with STS subtypes (n=206) in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database, (2) an in-house gene microarray of lipomatous tumors (n=71), LPS cell lines (n=3) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX, n=3), (3) an in-house tissue microarray (TMA) of lipomatous tumors (n=115), LPS cell lines (n=3) and PDXs (n=3) and (4) an in-house TMA of WD\/DD LPS (n=71). IGF2BP3 protein expression in TMAs was quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IGF2BP3 gene and protein expression values from identical samples were compared by Pearson correlation (n=43). The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare survival outcomes.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the TCGA cohort, which does not include WD LPS, <i>IGF2BP3<\/i> expression was a poor prognostic factor solely in DD LPS (n=50, median overall survival (mOS): 1.6 vs 5.0 years, <i>p<\/i>=0.009). Among gene microarray samples, <i>IGF2BP3<\/i> expression was highest in DD LPS (n=18) compared to WD LPS (n=29) and lipoma (n=7) by paired t-tests (<i>p<\/i>=0.03 and 0.002, respectively) and <i>IGF2BP3<\/i> expression was associated with worse survival in WD\/DD LPS (mOS 7.7 vs 21.5 years, <i>p<\/i>=0.02). In both TMAs, IGF2BP3 expression (&#62;25% cell positivity\/core) portended worse survival in WD\/DD LPS (mOS (3): 3.7 vs 13.8 years, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001 and mOS (4): 2.7 vs 14.9 years, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). IGF2BP3 was not expressed in myxoid LPS (n=21) or lipoma (n=8) samples. Gene and protein expression of IGF2BP3 were positively correlated in WD\/DD LPS (r<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.69). IGF2BP3 expression was more strongly associated with survival than LPS differentiation status (mOS: 7.0 (DD) vs 15.2 years (WD), <i>p<\/i>=0.02). Furthermore, all LPS cell lines and PDXs demonstrated high gene and protein expression of IGF2BP3.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>IGF2BP3 is highly expressed in a subset of LPS. Across independent datasets, IGF2BP3 is also a biomarker of disease progression and worse survival, and may stratify patients more effectively than histologic differentiation. Mechanistic studies of IGF2BP3 in LPS tumorigenesis and progression using aforementioned LPS cell lines and PDX models are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/08371905-0325-497d-b644-d520380fd347\/@t03B8ZC8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Tumor staging: Correlation of clinical and molecular markers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tissue microarrays,Prognostic markers,Tumorigenicity,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15954"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyle D.

In treatment na&#239;ve patients, risk stratification by standard pathology and tissue based genomic testing can be influenced by sampling errors inherent to PCa biopsy. Exosome-based liquid biopsies are emerging as a clinically effective platform for minimally invasive and highly sensitive diagnostics for diverse types of cancer. In this project we undertake the development of a plasma exosome-based liquid biopsy to stratify patients with clinically significant PCa that may circumvent the sampling challenges associated with tissue-based genomic tests. Exosomes are small double-lipid membrane vesicles that cells actively shed into various biofluids and that provide stable packages for RNA, DNA and protein molecules. Here we take advantage of a well-developed exosomal biomarker analysis platform to profile plasma exosomal RNA markers that differentiate treatment-na&#239;ve men diagnosed with NCCN low risk vs high risk PCa as the first step in the development of a plasma exosomal liquid biopsy to support the management of patients with intermediate and high-risk disease.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We compared plasma exosomal RNA profiles from 11 high-risk and 9 low-risk, treatment-na&#239;ve, biopsy-confirmed patients together with 4 healthy controls. Exosomes were isolated from 1 ml plasma samples and exosomal RNA prepared using the ExosomeDx ExoLution platform. A hybrid-capture RNA Next Generation Sequencing analysis was performed to enrich for transcripts of exons, 3&#8217; and 5&#8217; untranslated RNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) to identify differentially expressed RNAs.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We detected over 10,000 protein coding genes and ~400 lncRNAs in each plasma sample using exosomal RNAseq. 273 genes were differentially expressed between high-risk vs control but not in low-risk vs control. We identified four potential plasma exosomal biomarkers of high-risk PCa. These include three protein coding mRNA transcripts that showed greater than 20-fold lower expression in plasma from high-risk in comparison to low-risk patients; TCGA data show that two of these mRNA markers are also downregulated in PCa tissue in patients with worse survival. In addition, we identified one lncRNA that showed greater than 20-fold higher expression in plasma from high-risk in comparison to low-risk patients. We also detected multiple alternate androgen receptor transcripts in plasma exosomal RNA from the high-risk patients. Together, these represent early data for potentially novel liquid biopsy RNA biomarkers for high-risk PCa.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Here we report results of a liquid biopsy biomarker discovery study to develop an exosome-based long RNA test for to support the management of patients with intermediate and high-risk PCa.

It is often associated with a history of smoking\/alcohol consumption or exposure to the human papilloma virus (HPV). Beyond surgery, treatment usually includes DNA damaging treatments i.e. cisplatin\/5FU combined or not with radiation therapy. Treatment failure rates are still high due to intrinsic and acquired mechanisms of resistance, largely involving DNA repair mechanisms. Here we precisely examined the main DNA repair mechanisms susceptible to drive tumor progression and resistance to treatment, using a miniaturized comprehensive functional approach on biochip. Enzymatic DNA repair profiles were compared for lymphocytes and tumor biopsies taken before treatment from 38 patients in a prospective clinical study. We simultaneously investigated double strand break repair pathways (HR, NHEJ, SSA, alt-EJ), excision\/synthesis repair mechanisms (BER, NER, ICLR) and several glycosylases\/AP endonuclease activities, using lysates prepared from the samples. Results were correlated with physiologic and lifestyle\/risk factors, TNM tumor classification, treatment-induced adverse effects, and disease progression or death at 18 months. Analysis of blood cells and biopsies provided different and complementary information. Indeed, the prediction of treatment-induced severe toxicity was effective on blood cells. Several risk factors significantly affected specific repair activities of tumor cells. HPV positive and negative tumors displayed distinct DNA repair profiles and, cancer progression and tumor staging correlated with deregulated repair activities in tumors. Interestingly, the most affected DNA repair activities concerned double strand break repair, repair of cisplatin adducts, and repair of oxidative damage. This accurate DNA repair profiling represents an innovative strategy to reveal tumor diversity and better understand the impact of risk factors. It improved our understanding of the role of DNA repair in the development and progression of cancer. In addition, the use of a panel of DNA repair-based enzymatic biomarkers is more accurate than the single parameter approach in stratifying patients into different groups, thus allowing for more effective therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bfb869d4-a484-4429-8050-1a6385a2476d\/@t03B8ZC8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,DNA repair,Biomarkers,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15957"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sylvie Sauvaigo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanna Muggiolu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Libert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bertrand Treillard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gersende Alphonse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian A.

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, patients harboring alterations in DDR genes, such as in homology-directed repair (HDR), comprise the 10-20% of patients that may benefit from the recent FDA approval of Olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that disrupts non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Despite being the best-in-class targeted therapy for DDR-altered pancreatic cancers, a subset of patients fails to respond to Olaparib and those that initially respond eventually go on to develop resistance. The mechanisms underlying resistance are poorly elucidated but suggest that some patients harboring DDR-altered tumors are HDR-proficient or revert to HDR-proficiency during therapy, bypassing the second gene deficiency requisite for synthetic lethal induction with targeted therapy (e.g., Olaparib). Utilizing patient-derived models of cancer, we are actively investigating DDR-altered, pancreatic tumor cell lines and exploring the relationship between DDR-alterations and HDR-deficiency with three goals: [1] To evaluate the prevalence of HDR-proficiency in BRCA-altered tumors, [2] to understand the extent to which patient-derived models of cancer are concordant and predictive of clinical outcomes, and [3] to identify novel therapeutic strategies for resistant patients. So far, we have observed HDR-proficiency by functional assays (e.g., RAD51 foci formation) in DDR-altered patient-derived cell lines that corresponds with poor response to Olaparib <i>in vitro<\/i>, and resistance to platinum therapy clinically. Whereas DDR-altered HDR-deficient lines had greater sensitivity to Olaparib and platinum therapy. These early data suggest that measures of HDR by functional assay may be more predictive of clinical therapeutic responses than the use of genetic signatures alone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d8ae506-c6a2-4868-9e36-dc4af068a976\/@t03B8ZC8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,DNA damage response,PARP inhibitors,Patient-derived models of cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15958"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James R.

Determining a non-invasive means of limiting disease progression would allow men to avoid quality of life issues associated with radical prostate treatment. Some modifiable factors, such as obesity and lipid levels, are associated with prostate cancer risk, though no behavioral intervention has been shown to affect prostate cancer outcomes. Using a prospective study of men on active surveillance, our group recently demonstrated that higher quality diets were associated with a significantly lower risk of disease progression. The Mediterranean diet (MD) specifically may be beneficial for men with localized prostate cancer (PCa) on active surveillance (AS) because of its anti-inflammatory, antilipidemic, and chemopreventive properties. Furthermore, recent evidence supports that dietary interventions can induce modulation of the gut microbiome, and consequently, immune function and inflammatory pathways, which warrants further investigation of the microbiome&#8217;s role in the context of prostate cancer. Here, we describe a novel dietary intervention among a group of men with localized prostate cancer who are electing to undergo prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment. The intervention is a feeding study involving the provision of an isocaloric, high quality diet based on the lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory parameters of the Mediterranean diet, including a strong focus on fiber-rich plant foods and healthy sources of mono and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. The primary outcome in this pilot study is the feasibility of a neoadjuvant dietary intervention. Secondary outcomes include studying the effects of the diet on metabolic parameters, the fecal microbiome, and changes in circulating metabolites shown to be associated with progression on active surveillance. Furthermore, by focusing on African-American and non-Hispanic White males, this study may provide insights into the key differences in inflammatory, immune and microbiome signatures, which may underly the prominent cancer-racial disparity seen in African-American men.

The traditional classification of lung adenocarcinoma involves invasiveness, growth pattern, presence of mucin, and other histological features. However, this classification provides limited prognostic predictability. Molecular profiles based The Cancer genome Atlas lung adenocarcinoma cohort classified the tumors into the terminal respiratory unit (TRU), proximal proliferative (PP), and proximal infiltrative (PI) based on unsupervised classification, which did not address clinical applicability to the classification. Here, we developed an unsupervised classification with Density-based UMAP (DBU), which identified four transcriptomic profiles for lung adenocarcinoma (Transcriptomic profile, TP1-TP4). We identified a gene signature with 299 genes to develop a supervised classifier, called Ensemble Transcriptomic classifier (ETC), to identify these four subgroups within the total cohort. All TP1 is PI. TP2 is 49.0% TFU and 45.0% PP. TP3 is 76.2% PI and 23.8% PP. TP4 is 54.5% TFU and 45.5% PI. TP1 is characterized by neuroendocrine-like features and clusters with large cell neuroendocrine tumors in cluster analysis. TP3 is squamous-like enriched with cell cycle and DNA repair high and worse prognosis and groups with squamous cell carcinoma in cluster analysis. TP2 has high immune cell infiltration, and TP4 showed low mutational burden and low immune cell infiltration. We validated these subgroups identified in the TCGA cohort in a microarray meta-dataset with DBU, ETC. This classification showed four subgroups in lung adenocarcinoma, which shows potential clinical actionable findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e430e95-2efd-465b-a5b1-2a22b5889683\/@t03B8ZC8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression,Machine learning,Molecular subtypes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15960"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Khaled Bin Satter<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul MH Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lynn KH Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Nechtman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikhil Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruno Santos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diane Hopkins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nagla Abdel Karim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin-Xiong She<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharad B.
