[{"Abstract":"Background: Bronchial pre-malignant lesions (PMLs) are the putative precursors for bronchial squamous cell carcinoma. PMLs represent a spectrum of histologies, from low-grade lesions (hyperplasia, metaplasia) to high-grade lesions (dysplasia, carcinoma <i>in situ<\/i>). The majority of these lesions will regress or remain stable without clinical intervention while a subset of lesions will progress to invasive carcinoma. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of these lesions to elucidate the cross-talk between epithelial, stromal, and immune populations in lesions of increasing histological grade.<br \/>Methods: Thirty lesions from seventeen participants were biopsied via bronchoscopy. Cells were sorted by CD45+\/- FACS gating and sequenced with the Cel-Seq2 protocol. Celda was used to bi-cluster genes into modules and cells into clusters. Cells were filtered by mitochondrial percentage (%<sub>mito<\/sub> &#60; 50%), minimum UMI counts (n<sub>UMI<\/sub> &#62; 300), and doublet detection. Cell types were labeled by marker gene expression.<br \/>Results: After filtering low quality cells, we analyzed 4,382 cells. We observed expected smoking related shifts in epithelial cell type proportions, including an increase in secretory cells (&#967;<sup>2<\/sup> = 31.39, p = 2.11 X 10<sup>-8<\/sup>) and a decrease in ciliated cells (&#967;<sup>2<\/sup> = 4.83, p = 0.028) among current smokers. Distinct differences in expression of transcriptional modules were observed between KRT5+ (basal) cells from different histologic grades. Basal cells from high grade lesions expressed smoking detoxification and cell cycle gene programs, while low grade lesion basal cells expressed differentiation gene programs. We also identified a group of cells from CIS lesions involved in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, marked by an increase in SPARC and COL4A1 expression and a decrease in CDH1 expression. Subpopulations of immune cells identified include macrophages, CD4\/8+ T, B, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Several clusters of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells displayed an exhausted phenotype, marked by the expression of PD-1, CTLA4, LAG3, and TIGIT. Samples with high grade histology (dysplasia, carcinoma <i>in situ<\/i>) were enriched in CD4+ Tregs and myeloid cells compared to low grade histology samples (hyperplasia, metaplasia), which were enriched in Natural Killer and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (&#967;<sup>2<\/sup> = 298.95, p = 0.001).<br \/>Discussion: Our results suggest that changes in specific transcriptional programs are associated with the transition of epithelial cells to more invasive states and that changes in immune populations are associated with increasing histological grade. These signatures can suggest novel avenues for chemoprevention and cancer interception.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/733237e5-9b88-44fd-aa2e-d256255b29c1\/@B03B8ZKH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-10 Prevention and treatment of premalignant lesions (intraepithelial neoplasia),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Premalignancy,Squamous cell carcinoma,Single cell,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13333"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Conor Shea<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukas Kalinke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kitty De Jong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kate Gowers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diane Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sherry Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack Cunningham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ipsita Dey-Guha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Hennon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sai Yendamuri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Stevenson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avrum Spira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary E.

However, a proportion of basal cells with lower (&#8220;near normal&#8221;) mutation burden are observed, which show preferential expansion in response to smoking cessation(1). We believe this expansion represents a &#8220;cancer protective&#8221; process, reducing the risk of future malignancy. However, mechanisms determining the dynamic balance of high versus low mutant basal cells throughout the bronchial tree are unclear.<br \/>We have developed protocols that enable systematic scanning of airway epithelium in resected lung specimens, through which we aim to elucidate the mutation burden and spatial clonal architecture across contiguous regions of normal epithelium through the bronchial tree.<br \/>Study design: 5-10 current or former smokers undergoing curative lobectomy for peripheral lung cancer with histologically normal airways will be consented to the study. To date, two participants have donated their samples.<br \/>Fresh lobectomies were collected at the point of resection and kept on wet ice until pathological examination. All samples undergo examination within 1 hour of resection. The lobe is orientated, and the tumour and segmental bronchi identified. A sterile metal cannula is inserted through the airway lumen and sterile pathology scissors are used to carefully isolate the airways from the surrounding parenchyma. Upon macro-dissection, airway branches are immediately placed into transport media containing antibiotics. Samples are gently washed using transport media to remove residual blood, then sectioned into 1 cm<sup>3<\/sup> segments, which are orientated, embedded and frozen in room-temperature Optimal Cutting Temperature compound. An 8 &#956;M section is cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin from each block immediately after a &#8220;full-face&#8221; tissue confirmation is observed.These will be used as guiding slides for laser capture microdissection of the regions of epithelium prior to downstream sequencing pathway.<br \/>Conclusion: We have developed a pathological approach in which we can define somatic mutations in normal epithelium along the bronchial tree. We will use these data to determine basal cell clonal relationships and interpret these in a spatial context, creating a more detailed map of the smoking-induced changes that occur in the airway epithelium and how these may contribute to early carcinogenesis.<br \/>References1.Yoshida K, Gowers KHC, Lee-Six H, Chandrasekharan DP, Coorens T, Maughan EF, et al.

Previously, we reported that decreased numbers of specific immune cell types in lobules of BBD biopsies predicted increased BC risk, suggesting the promise of future tissue biomarker studies to define BC risk markers among BBD patients. Thus, we applied protein-based GeoMx&#174; Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) to BBD biopsies preceding BC (cases) and to BBD biopsies from cancer-free patients (controls) to identify possible BC risk markers, which we then evaluated in subsequent BC tissues and in surrounding normal lobules of cases.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Archived pathology slides of BBD biopsies were reviewed and used to guide preparation of TMAs containing 1.0-mm diameter FFPE cores of lobules from an age- and cohort-period-matched set of 91 cases and 88 controls from the Mayo Clinic BBD Cohort. For patients who later developed BC, we prepared TMAs of BC tissue and surrounding mapped normal lobules. We applied GeoMx&#174; DSP (immune and canonical signaling proteins) to both sets of TMAs. Following QC and data normalization, associations of case status with log-transformed biomarker expression in lobules of BBD biopsies were carried out using linear mixed modeling approaches, accounting for multiple ROIs per individual. Biomarkers significantly associated with case status (p&#60;0.05) were further examined in BCs and adjacent normal lobules, using similar approaches.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The mean age at BBD biopsy was 52 years, and at BC diagnosis of cases, 61.4 years (mean time from BBD to BC was 10.2 years). A family history of BC was more frequent among cases (70% versus 43%; chi-square p=0.002). Of 72 biomarkers tested, 46 (64.4%) were evaluable after QC and normalization and 5 were associated with BC risk after adjustment for family history of BC: BCL2 (p=0.005), STING (p=0.006), CD44 (p=0.02), S100 protein (p=0.03) and pan-AKT (p=0.05); each showed higher levels in lobules of BBD biopsies of controls than cases. Three unique patterns appeared when examining these biomarkers across tissue type within cases: for BCL2 (p=5 x 10<sup>-9<\/sup>) and STING (p=2 x 10<sup>-19<\/sup>), levels were high in both BC and lobules surrounding BC but low in preceding BBD; for GAPDH (p=4 x 10<sup>-53<\/sup>) and pan-AKT (p=2 x 10<sup>-33<\/sup>), levels were high in BC, low in preceding BBD, and moderate in lobules surrounding BC; and for CD44 (p=2 x 10<sup>-6<\/sup>) and S100B (p=2 x 10<sup>-49<\/sup>), levels were low in BC, high in lobules surrounding BC and moderate in preceding BBD.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Using a novel TMA of lobules in combination with DSP, we preliminarily identified immune-based and PI3 kinase-related protein biomarkers in BBD biopsies associated with BC risk. In case-only analyses, these markers demonstrated complex differences between lobules in BBD biopsies, subsequent BCs and adjacent normal lobules.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f20efda-0ca7-46d2-b3ed-d62fc586cf20\/@C03B8ZKJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Protein expression,Biomarkers,Risk factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13710"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robert Alan Vierkant<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jodi M.

Receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#954;B ligand (RANKL) signaling mediates the major proliferative response of mammary epithelium to progesterone and is positively associated with breast density but there are no clinical trial data on the impact of RANKL inhibition on breast tissue markers in women with dense breasts. We, therefore, determined the impact of RANKL inhibition on breast tissue gene expression in high-risk premenopausal women with dense breasts.<br \/>Study design: Pilot phase I clinical trial of 9 healthy high-risk pre-menopausal women (&#8805;35 years of age) with dense breasts performed at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO from July 2018-December 2018. Fifty-five percent of participants had a positive family history of breast cancer in a first degree relative.<br \/>Intervention: Participants were given a single dose of subcutaneous RANKL antibody, denosumab (60mg), at baseline (Day 1). On the same day, prior to the denosumab injection, participants had an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy and a blood draw. All study participants returned for repeat core needle biopsy and blood draw after 60 days (Day 60).<br \/>Outcome Measures: Changes in breast tissue gene expression between Day 1 and Day 60 with a focus on immune\/inflammatory and hormone markers. Gene expression was profiled using NanoString nCounter platform. We performed pathway enrichment analysis and used Cell Maker Enrichment library from EnrichR to identify differentially expressed genes. Genes with a p-value&#60;0.05 on differential expression analysis were considered statistically significant for utilization in pathway enrichment analysis. Libraries utilized for pathway enrichment using the EnrichR platform included the ChEA transcription factor library, GO Biological Process library, and Cellular Components library.<br \/>Results: Macrophage markers, including CCR5, CD86, CD300A, and CD84 and targets downstream of IRF8: (p-value =4.73e-7), neutrophil degranulation\/neutrophil activation in the immune response (p-value=6.0e-21), and the secretory granule membrane pathways (p-value=2.4e-14) were downregulated in breast tissues on Day 60. Pathways involved in progesterone metabolism (p-value=0.0003), estrogen response (p-value=0.0014) and fatty acid metabolism, (p-value=0.0001) were significantly upregulated on Day 60.

Since eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) improve insulin sensitivity and reduce IGFR-related signaling, we explored the effect of EPA + DHA supplementation on FOXA1 and AGR2 expression in benign breast epithelium.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Reserved excess cells from fine needle aspirations performed pre and post 6 months of supplementation given to postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer were utilized. Cells had been stored at -20 C in a methanol fixative for ~10 y (Fabian et al, Ca Prev Res 2015). Of the 35 women entered, 28 had reserved excess cells available for blocks and after obtaining 4-5 sections per block, 12 had sufficient epithelial cells on both pre and post intervention slides as determined by H and E staining to proceed with immunohistochemistry assessment. Of the 12, median age was 53 and 7\/12 were on low dose hormone replacement during the study. Slides were stained with FOXA1 (2F83 Mouse Monoclonal Antibody) at a 1:50 dilution and AGR2 rabbit polyclonal (Proteintech,12275-1-AP) at a 1:800 dilution. F0XA1 exhibits a nuclear staining pattern whereas AGR2 is predominately cytoplasmic. IHC staining was assessed individually by two readers (TM and TP). The most abnormal cell clusters were preferentially assessed. Up to 500 cells are evaluated for percent positive stain and staining intensity. An Allred score was computed as the sum of a categorical score for percent positive cells and a categorical score for the predominant staining intensity.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>For FOXA1 there was a statistically significant decrease in percent positive cells (11\/12, p=0.019) and Allred score (9\/12, p=0.022) by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Of the 11 which showed a decrease in FOXA1, seven were on HRT throughout the study (usually estrogen alone). There was no statistically significant change in AGR2 IHC. However, there was a robust linear relationship between stain positivity for FOXA1 and AGR2 (p&#60;0.001), as well as for the change in percent positive cells over the course of the intervention (p&#60;0.003). There was no statistically significant correlation between change in FOXA1 and change in Ki-67 immunocytochemical staining (performed as part of the original study), nor for a variety of serum measures of insulin sensitivity or resistance including HOMA-IR and HOMA %B.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: If this finding is confirmed in other studies, FOXA1 protein expression may be a useful tissue response biomarker in breast cancer prevention trials of omega-3 fatty acids.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d745275-9868-4956-af0e-4457e66f82c0\/@C03B8ZKJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fatty acids,Chemopreventive agents,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13337"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Carol J.

Epidemiologic surveillance of these lesions is uncommon but might be useful to guide preventive interventions. We sought to estimate the prevalence of CIN 2\/3 and its racial and ethnic distribution, accounting for patient&#8217;s clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used data from hospital and physician billing claims for any CIN diagnosis occurring at the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS) from 01\/01\/2016 through 12\/31\/2020, along with respective clinical and sociodemographic characteristics at the time of diagnosis. We estimated average adjusted prevalence of CIN 2\/3 lesions by race and ethnicity, from average marginal effects, after selecting most relevant patient factors from a logistic regression (LR) using backward selection (removing terms with p &#8805; 0.2 and adding those with p &#60; 0.1).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>There were 1,538 women<b> <\/b>diagnosed with CIN 1, 2, 3, and unspecified dysplasia of the cervix uteri with respective prevalence of 45%, 14%, 12%, and 30%.<b> <\/b>CIN2\/3 prevalence (26%) varied by race and ethnicity: Asians (39%) &#62; Latinas (32%) &#62; Whites (28%) &#62;Blacks (23%) &#62; Other (20%).<b> <\/b>Of the variables included in the LR model (age, marital status, religion, preferred language, insurance status, Body Mass Index, HIV, HPV, presence of bacterial vaginosis, hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, pulmonary conditions, arthritis, heart conditions, pregnancy status, parity, smoking, alcohol, and previous cancer diagnoses), only age, diabetes, pulmonary conditions, smoking, and heart disease remained in the final LR model. The estimated average adjusted prevalence of a CIN 2\/3 diagnosis remained highest for Asian women (35%, 95%CI: 17-52%), followed by Latinx (28%, 95%CI: 19-37%), Whites (25%, 95%CI 22-29%), Blacks (23%, 95%CI: 20-27%), and other (18%, 95%CI: 9-26%).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The higher CIN 2\/3 prevalence estimates among Asian women relative to other races and ethnicities is unexpected, as it does not align with current distribution of cervical cancer diagnoses at VCUHS (only 3% Asian), nor with the patterns of cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in Virginia and in the United States, where Asian women have the lowest incidence and mortality.

PCa onset at younger age is more likely to be aggressive in African American (AA) population. Also, application of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue in RNA based study was significantly hindered due to poor quality\/quantity of RNA in archived pathology slides. This study is aimed to examine age\/race associated gene signatures in military cohort with high representation of AA and younger population in FFPE samples for potential genetic mechanisms of health disparities and broaden tissue sample availability.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A cohort of 41 Caucasian American (CA) and 20 AA non-familial PCa patients from the biospecimen bank of CPDR, WRNMMC were used. Specimens donated by radical prostatectomy patients who provided written consent and protocols approved by Institutional Review Boards. Total RNA was extracted from tumor and the adjacent normal epithelium of whole-mount FFPE tissue of matched specimens. Differential gene expression, in tumor versus normal tissues, between younger and older AA and CA patients were analyzed by NanoString using a customized CodeSet of 151 probes. The panel designed to detect 135 target transcripts, compiled from 34 genes implicated\/associated with PCa progression, 27 PCa specific gene fusions, 25 cancer-associated genes, and 5 genes encoding ETS-family of transcription factors. The 27 over-expressed genes and 17 under-expressed genes in PCa were included as comparison to matched, benign epithelium.

Addressing the low cervical cancer screening rates among Arab American women in Michigan requires a deep understanding of the community&#8217;s perspective about cervical cancer screening. Thus, we conducted a series of focus groups in Southeastern Michigan to understand the attitudes, acceptability, and barriers of cervical cancer screening among this population.<br \/>Four focus groups with a total of 19 women were conducted via Zoom. Participants were recruited through social media channels and community organizations. All focus groups were conducted with self-identifying Arab, Arab American, or Chaldean women aged 30 to 61. The focus groups were conducted in either English, Arabic, or a mixture of both languages. Women completed a brief anchoring survey with demographic questions and a self-assessment of their HPV knowledge (see Table 1). The guided discussion centered around knowledge of cervical cancer, broadly, knowledge of Human papillomavirus (HPV) and its transmission, attitudes towards the HPV vaccination, and attitudes towards cervical cancer screening, which included HPV self-sampling methods. The recorded sessions were transcribed and are being coded using Dedoose Version 8.0.35, a qualitative analysis software. During the focus group, the discussion centered around barriers at the individual and community levels for screening and vaccination, attitudes towards preventive health care including screening, a need for accessible women&#8217;s health literature, and health education. The women also discussed vaccine hesitancy related to HPV and COVID19. This suggests the need for targeted community interventions.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{19987CFD-DEA2-43BA-8CB4-AF38042997E1}\"><caption>General

Health disparities in incidence and clinical outcome are also reported among different racial groups, most notably African American (AA) women, who are often diagnosed at a young age with aggressive BC and exhibit greater mortality than Caucasian American (CA) women. Since socioeconomic difficulties can have tremendous impact on psychophysiology besides limiting the access to optimal healthcare, we examined the serum levels of stress (cortisol) and satiety (leptin) hormones as well as inflammatory cytokines (resistin and interleukin-6\/ IL-6) in AA and CA women. To observe a potential epigenomic connection, we also performed profiling of a targeted set of exosomal microRNAs in serum samples. The study was conducted under an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol. All subjects participated voluntarily, and their consents were obtained. Serum levels of resistin, IL-6, leptin, and cortisol were quantified by Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) using commercial kits. Exosomes were isolated using precipitation method and recovered by standard centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated from exosomal preps and subjected to stem-loop RT-PCR for quantitation of a set of inflammation-associated microRNAs. We found that the levels of resistin, leptin, IL-6 and cortisol were higher in women with a BC diagnosis than non-BC subjects. Moreover, AA women with or without BC showed significantly higher levels of these cytokines and hormones in their serum as compared to the CA women with or without a BC diagnosis, respectively. We also observed differential expression of several microRNAs in serum of BC women as compared to their normal counterparts, of which five (miR511, miR33a, miR27a, miR6794, miR143-3p) exhibited highest presence in serum exosomes of AA women with BC. Together, these findings suggest that relatively greater exposure of minority women to social stressors may have epigenomic consequences and may potentially be linked to the observed BC racial health disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dee06546-52bd-4f22-a313-95d16de4d9e7\/@C03B8ZKJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-03 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cytokines,Exosomes,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13347"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarabjeet Kour Sudan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kunwar Somesh Vikramdeo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amod Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sachin Kumar Deshmukh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjeev Kumar Srivastava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teja Poosarla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolette P.

Lung cancer incidence rates and mortality rates are higher in black Americans than in white Americans despite lower tobacco exposure among black men than white men. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of lung cancer in all ethnic\/racial groups, including blacks. Genetic driver mutations differ among racial\/ethnic groups. In addition, the same mutation could have different effects based on the genetic background arising from different racial\/ethnic groups. Therefore, it is important to study appropriate driver mutations in the correct genetic background. Protooncogenes from the <i>RAS<\/i> family, <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>NRAS<\/i>, and <i>HRAS<\/i>, play a crucial role in cell growth regulation, cell proliferation, and survival. <i>KRAS<\/i> is the most frequently mutated driver gene in black LUAD (~14%). <i>NRAS<\/i> mutations are also seen (1-2%). It is therefore important to study LUAD cell lines carrying different <i>RAS<\/i> mutations in black Americans&#8217; genetic backgrounds. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is only one LUAD cell line from a black subject. The NCI-H23 cell line contains a heterozygous <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation at codon 12. We are generating a collection of isogenic cell lines derived from NCI-H23, tailored to study <i>RAS<\/i> gene activation in black Americans. We will correct the <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation to wildtype through CRISPR\/Cas9 deletion with co-transfection of the wild-type sequence. However, we expect that the NCI-H23 cells may not tolerate the removal of the <i>KRAS<\/i> without simultaneous replacement with another driver mutation. Therefore, we will replace the <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation with either mutated <i>NRAS<\/i>, <i>HRAS<\/i>, or <i>EGFR<\/i>. <i>EGFR<\/i> functions as a receptor tyrosine kinase in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway to control the activation of <i>RAS<\/i> oncogenes and is also frequently mutated in black LUAD (~8%). We have identified a heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism, rs11047919, 839 nucleotides downstream from the <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation which we are using to differentiate between the wild-type and mutated <i>KRAS<\/i> alleles following CRISPR editing. We will use the new cell lines to test the efficacy of polyisoprenylated cysteinyl amide inhibitors (PCAIs). These agents have been shown to disrupt <i>RAS<\/i>-mediated signaling in ethnically\/racially diverse cell lines. In the future, we will develop immortalized alveolar epithelial cell lines from black subjects to further address the lack of lung cancer models representing black Americans. Through our research, we intend to address one facet of the prominent lack of representation of black Americans in LUAD studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/afdeb25d-1cb1-47e3-af2b-a9b3177b57c1\/@C03B8ZKJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-03 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Ras oncogene,Cell lines,African American,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13718"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pablo E.

However, there are disparities in access to genomic cancer risk assessment (GCRA) and cancer prevention interventions related to geography, socioeconomic status, and limited public health support. We studied factors that affect the uptake of risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in Hispanic patients of Latin America (LatAm) and the United States (US).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Hispanic women enrolled in the Clinical Cancer Genomics Community Research Network registry between 1997-2019 who underwent genetic testing, had a personal or family history (FHX) of BC or OC, and had &#8805;6 months of follow-up data were considered eligible. Demographic and clinical factors associated with risk-appropriate uptake of RRS were considered. Data were analyzed using Fisher&#8217;s exact tests and logistic regression models.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: 1818 patients with a median follow-up of 43 months were studied. Most were from the US (65%), followed by Mexico (21%), Peru (10%), Colombia (2%), and Puerto Rico (2%). Median age at enrollment was 44 years; 81% had a personal history of BC and 5% of OC. Cancer-associated pathogenic variants (PVs) were identified in 459 patients (25%); 409 were in <i>BRCA<\/i>, 36 had other BC-susceptibility PVs (<i>ATM<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i>, <i>PALB2<\/i>, <i>PTEN<\/i>, or <i>TP53<\/i>), and 14 had other OC-susceptibility PVs (<i>BRIP1<\/i>, <i>MSH2<\/i>, <i>MSH6<\/i>, <i>MLH1<\/i>, or <i>RAD51C<\/i>). Overall, 449\/1715 (26.2%) patients underwent RRM, with a higher rate among patients in the US than those in LatAm (31% vs. 17%, p&#60;0.01); 377\/1517 (25%) patients underwent RRSO, with no regional differences observed (24% vs. 27%, p=0.22). The factors associated with undergoing RRM were US residence (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.7-2.8), age &#8804;50 (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.7-2.8), carrying a BC-predisposing PV (OR 3.5; 95% CI 2.8-4.4), positive FHX for BC (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.2-1.9), and personal history of cancer (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.4-5.6). In a multivariate model, US residence, age, and previous BC diagnosis remained independent predictors for RRM in BC-susceptibility gene PV carriers, while age was not a significant factor in non-carriers. The factors associated with undergoing RRSO included being a carrier of an OC-predisposing PV (OR 6.3; 95% CI 4.8-8.1), positive FHX for OC (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.5-2.8), and previous cancer diagnosis (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.5). In carriers of OC-susceptibility gene PVs, residing in US and previous cancer diagnosis were independently associated with RRSO, while positive FHX for OC and previous cancer diagnosis were identified as independent factors in non-carriers.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: There are disparities in the uptake of RRS outside the US. Beyond limitations in resources, understanding the factors associated with undergoing RRS could be key to developing targeted interventions to improve the uptake of risk-appropriate measures in hereditary cancer syndrome patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4db6d74c-ea11-4fa9-9b84-7ac01e2eee05\/@D03B8ZKK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-03 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic susceptibility,BRCA,Prevention,Hispanic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13348"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeffrey N.

Potential polymorphism in <i>EXO1<\/i> may have the ability to control cancer risks by influencing the repair activity. K589E (rs1047840) is a potentially functional polymorphism in <i>EXO1<\/i> gene and we hypothesized that it might be associated with risk of breast cancer in Bangladesh.<br \/>Method: We designed a case-control study consisting of 184 subjects with breast cancer and 200 healthy controls to identify the effect of K589E polymorphism on breast cancer susceptibility and clinicopathological features in Bangladeshi women. Genotype determination was performed by PCR-RFLP method.<br \/>Results: After the adjustment of age and weight, a significant association was found between <i>EXO1<\/i> K589E alleles and genotypes and risk of breast cancer. The frequencies of the three genotypes G\/G, G\/A, and A\/A were 49, 42, and 9% in cases whereas 69, 27.5, and 3.5% in controls, respectively. The heterozygote G\/A genotype and combined G\/A+A\/A genotypes showed 2.12-fold (OR=2.12, 95% CI=1.3733 - 3.2822 <i>p<\/i>=0.0007) and 2.27-fold (OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.5001 - 3.4493, <i>p<\/i>=0.0001) increased risk of breast cancer, respectively when compared with homozygous G\/G genotypes. The variant A allele also was associated with increased risk of breast cancer (OR= 3.46, 95% CI=1.3720 - 8.7571, <i>p<\/i>=0.0086). Analysis of clinicopathological characteristics and genotype distribution also showed a significant correlation.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results revealed that <i>EXO1<\/i> K589E polymorphism could be a potential predisposing risk factor in genetic susceptibility to breast cancer in Bangladesh.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Exonuclease1 ,K589E SNP,Genetic polymorphism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13711"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Md.
