[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant tumor in children. MB-related treatment failures and deaths mostly result from metastasis. One of the key genetic drivers in MB is <i>MYCN<\/i>, whose aberrant expressions are associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Long non-coding (lnc)RNAs have been implied as potential targets for cancer treatment. More insights into the role of lncRNAs in MYCN-mediated MB progression would have both prognostic and therapeutic significance in metastatic MB. Cell-derived vesicles such as exosome can encapsulate siRNAs to improve their bioavailability and targeted delivery to brain tumors. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is a readily available and modifiable source to produce functional exosomes. <b>Objective:<\/b> To identify the downstream lncRNAs of MYCN that contributes to MB metastasis, and to develop a novel gene therapy for MB by MSC exosome-delivered siRNAs to target these prometastatic lncRNAs. <b>Methods:<\/b> An RNA sequencing analysis was used to identify <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> as a MYCN targeting gene in MYCN-overexpressing MB cells. The association of <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> and MYCN was validated in MB cell lines by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay, and in tumor tissues by in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The anti-tumor effect of <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> knockdown in MYCN-overexpressing MB cells was assessed <i>in vitro<\/i> by migration and sphere formation assays, and in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model by intracranial injection. To generate therapeutic exosomes, MSCs were transfected with exogenous <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> siRNAs and then subjected to exosome characterization of size distribution and marker expression. The effect of exosome treatment on MB cells was evaluated using RT-qPCR and wound healing assay. <b>Results:<\/b> Elevated <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> was found in MYCN-overexpressed MB cells compared to parental cells, and this association was confirmed in clinical tissue samples. <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> expression was correlated with poor prognosis in SHH-&#945; and SHH-&#947; MB subtypes of patients. Knockdown of <i>LOXL1-AS1 <\/i>significantly reduced cell migration and cancer stemness properties of MB cells<i> in vitro, <\/i>and suppressed orthotopic tumor growth, metastasis, and enhanced survival in xenografted mice. Exogenous siRNAs were successfully packaged into MSC exosomes by cell transfection. Treatment of MB cells with <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> siRNA-loaded exosomes effectively reduced <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> expression and inhibited cell migration compared to those treated with unmodified exosomes. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study has proven the contributive role of <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> in promoting cancer progression and metastasis of MYCN-associated MB, and provided <i>in vitro<\/i> evidence to support the feasibility of <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> gene therapy through siRNA-loaded MSC exosomes. <i>In vivo <\/i>biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy assessment of MSC exosome-delivered <i>LOXL1-AS1 <\/i>siRNAs are being investigated in animal models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7499c0a1-445f-4007-9ad5-cffdf11a1f08\/@s03B8ZRL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal stem cell,lncRNA,Medulloblastoma,Exosomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17708"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anh Duy Do<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Ling Hsieh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tai-Tong Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shian-Ying Sung<\/i><\/presenter>.

Indeed, ovarian cancer is classified as a &#8220;cold tumor&#8221; with most tumors exhibiting low levels of T cell infiltrates and poor responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is therefore important to develop better immune modulatory modalities that can improve clinical responses. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of CARG-2020, a virus-like vesicle (VLV) delivering three immune modulators (single chain IL-12, IL-17 antagonist and shRNA for PD-L1) in eliciting an effective and sustained anti-tumoral response to prevent recurrent disease in a syngeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer.<br \/>Materials and Methods:<b> <\/b>Triple knockout (TKO; <i>p53<\/i><sup>LSL-R172H<\/sup>\/<i>Dicer<\/i><sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><i>\/Pten<\/i><sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>) mouse ovarian cancer cells stably expressing the mCherry fluorescent protein were injected i.p. in C57BL\/6 mice. Tumor growth was monitored by live imaging using mCherry fluorescence as surrogate for i.p. tumor burden. Treatment commenced when mCherry region of interest (ROI) area reached 20,000 photons\/sec. Treatment groups were as follows (n=6\/group): 1) PBS Control; 2) 1x10^6 PFU CARG-2020; 3) 1x10^6 PFU VLV-GFP (vector only control). All treatments were given i.p. for a total of 3 doses given 72h apart. Percentage of effector memory, central memory, and na&#239;ve CD8 T cells were measured by flow cytometry by staining for CD8, CD44, and CD62L.<br \/>Results: Treatment with CARG-2020 induced a significant decrease in i.p. tumor burden compared to PBS Control (p=0.0044) and VLV-GFP (p=0.0011). Complete disease regression was observed in all CARG-2020-treated mice with a significant impact on overall survival conferring 100% protection (p=0.0008). Rechallenge of these animals with the same cancer cells failed to form tumors and analysis of splenocytes showed high levels of CD8+\/CD44+\/CD62- cytolytic effector memory T cells compared to tumor-bearing control and tumor-bearing VLV-GFP-treated mice (p=0.0011). Transfer of splenocytes from long term survivor mice into a new set of tumor-bearing, treatment-na&#239;ve mice, induced complete disease regression (p&#60;0.0001, compared to PBS Control) and improved overall survival (p=0.0019, compared to PBS Control).<br \/>Conclusion: We report the successful anti-tumoral effect of CARG-2020 by modulating the immune response in a syngeneic mouse model of recurrent ovarian cancer. CARG-2020, by enhancing the expression of IL-12 and blocking IL-17 and PD-L1, provided a long-term protection associated with the expansion of cytolytic effector memory CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells, which in addition to its antitumoral effect, provides protection against recurrent disease. Our results provide rationale for the further development of this platform as a therapeutic modality for ovarian cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d159ab4e-132e-490f-a91b-5069a48c1ef7\/@s03B8ZRL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-03 Immune modulators,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Immunomodulation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18654"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ayesha B.

However, many cancers, such as melanoma, have less than 5% expression of HER2\/neu. The purpose of this study was to determine whether induced expression of erbb2 (mouse HER2\/neu analogue) could function as a neoantigen target for anti-erbb2 antibody.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> RT-PCR was used to construct a rat erbb2-encoding vector using the live, non-replicating lentivirus pLenti6.3. erbb2-encoding pLenti6.3 was transfected <i>in vitro<\/i> into the B16 mouse melanoma cell line, which has less than 5% endogenous expression of erbb2. The generated erbb2+ B16 cell line was designated B16\/neu. Anti-erbb2 antibody (7.16.4) was used to treat C57Bl\/6 male and female mice bearing B16\/neu (200 ug intraperitoneally three times per week for 3 weeks). To confirm activity of 7.16.4, this antibody (100 ug per T75 flask) was co-cultured with B16\/neu <i>in vitro<\/i>, and cell growth\/confluence was measured.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> The novel B16\/neu cell line expressed approximately 50% erbb2 <i>in vitro<\/i> on flow cytometry analysis, compared to 2% errb2 expression in na&#239;ve B16. Erbb2\/neu expression was confirmed on fluorescent Western blot. Anti-erbb2 antibody (7.16.4) slowed the growth of B16\/neu <i>in vitro<\/i>, confirming the suppressive effects of 7.16.4. In B16\/neu-bearing mice, 7.16.4 resulted in effective control of tumor growth and a complete tumor response rate of 35.7%, (5\/14 mice) compared to placebo controls (p &#60; 0.01). Interestingly, B16\/neu tumors demonstrated slower growth kinetics compared to na&#239;ve B16 tumors (p = 0.013), suggesting immune recognition of erbb2 in na&#239;ve C57Bl\/6 mice as a neoantigen target. No adverse reactions were observed with 7.16.4. <i>In vivo<\/i> inoculation of erbb2-encoding pLenti6.3 in na&#239;ve B16 tumors and treatment of <i>in vivo<\/i> transfected B16\/neu tumors with 7.16.4 comprise ongoing experiments.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> erbb2 expression on B16 melanoma was successfully achieved using a novel erbb2-encoding lentivirus.

HIF2a is constitutively activated following von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene inactivation, the signature event of the most common type of kidney cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). HIF2a functions as a heterodimeric transcription factor and regulates a program of gene expression that promotes cell proliferation, stemness, and angiogenesis. Using a highly specific inhibitor designed to target a structural vulnerability in HIF2a (PT2399), we previously showed that approximately 50% of ccRCCs are dependent on HIF2a. However, prolonged drug exposure results in resistance and the acquisition of gatekeeper mutations, which we reported first in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and subsequently in humans. Using the same PDX platform that previously validated PT2399, we show that HIF2a can be effectively inhibited using a tumor-directed siRNA (siHIF2). Referring herein to both first- and second-generation (ARO-HIF2) siRNA drugs, siHIF2 is specifically taken up by human ccRCC tumors transplanted in mice, where it depletes HIF2a inhibiting target gene expression and tumor growth. Through orthogonal RNA-seq studies integrating both PT2399 and siHIF2 in PDXs, we provide unprecedented detail on the HIF2a effector transcriptome, which we further dissect by incorporating ChIP-seq. A PDX line was generated from a ccRCC patient who had paraneoplastic polycythemia (a HIF2a dependent syndrome due to erythropoietin [Epo] secretion by the tumor) and participated in the phase I trial of ARO-HIF2 (NCT04169711). We show that siHIF2 effectively depleted HIF2a in both the PDX as well as in the patient, that it normalized Epo (and hemoglobin), and that it inhibited tumor growth. siHIF2 has activity against both wild-type and drug-resistant mutant HIF2a and is expected to be active in patients progressing on PT2977 (belzutifan), a PT2399-related drug recently approved by the FDA. To our knowledge, this is the first example of functional inactivation of an oncoprotein with a tumor-directed siRNA in humans. In summary, these studies provide unique insight into HIF2a (the only known core dependency in ccRCC), illustrate how it can be effectively inhibited by an siRNA drug, and establish a paradigm for the development of tumor directed siRNA-based therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/69fd65cd-3982-45f2-8662-e90632f78bf0\/@t03B8ZRM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-01 Antisense molecules,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"siRNA,Hypoxia-inducible factor,Resistance,Clinical trial,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21184"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yuanqing Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Stevens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Brandenburg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanina Toffessi Tcheuyap<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quyen N.
