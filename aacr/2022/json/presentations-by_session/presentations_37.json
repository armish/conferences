In breast cancer, <i>HER2<\/i> mutations typically occur in the absence of <i>HER2<\/i> amplification, are more common in invasive lobular breast cancer and in metastatic breast cancers, and are associated with poor prognosis. Recurrent <i>HER2<\/i> mutations promote resistance to breast cancer therapies such as endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancers and anti-HER2 therapy in <i>HER2<\/i>-amplified breast cancers. The HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) neratinib has shown clinical activity against cancers harboring HER2 activating mutations. However, not all <i>HER2<\/i>-mutant tumors respond, suggesting that co-occurring mutations may limit sensitivity. In addition, acquired resistance is common, and often associated with the acquisition of secondary mutations in <i>HER2<\/i>.<br \/>We recently characterized an <u>actionable pair<\/u> of co-occurring mutations in <i>HER2<\/i> and <i>HER3 (ERBB3)<\/i>. Gain-of-function mutations in <i>HER3 <\/i>tend to co-occur with <i>HER2 <\/i>missense mutations in tumors. To characterize the role of <i>HER3<\/i> mutations in <i>HER2-<\/i>mutant tumors, we integrated computational structural modeling with biochemical and cell biological analyses. Computational modeling predicted that the frequent HER3<sup>E928G <\/sup>kinase domain mutation enhances the affinity of HER2\/HER3, stabilizes the HER2 active conformation, and reduces binding of HER2 to its inhibitor neratinib. Co-expression of mutant HER2 and HER3 enhanced HER2\/HER3 co-immunoprecipitation and ligand-independent activation of HER2\/HER3 and PI3K\/AKT, resulting in enhanced growth, invasiveness, which was reversed by treatment with PI3K&#945; inhibitors.<br \/>Interestingly, <i>HER2<\/i> exon 20 insertion mutations, such as HER2<sup>YVMA<\/sup>, did not co-occur with HER3 mutations. Expression of HER2<sup>YVMA<\/sup>\/HER3<sup>WT<\/sup> strongly induced P-AKT and HER2\/HER3 interaction, which was not further increased by expression of HER3<sup>E928G<\/sup>, suggesting that <i>HER2<\/i> insertion mutations and <i>HER3<\/i> mutations are stronger activators of PI3K than <i>HER2 <\/i>missense mutations alone.<br \/>In <i>HER2<\/i>-mutant breast cancer cell line and patient-derived organoids, expression of HER3<sup>E928G<\/sup> resulted in reduced sensitivity to multiple HER2 TKIs and HER2 antibodies by disrupting neratinib binding and preventing the dissociation of HER2\/HER3, respectively. Cells expressing <i>HER2\/HER3<\/i> mutations or HER2<sup>YVMA<\/sup> were sensitive to the combination of a HER2 TKI and a PI3K&#945; inhibitor, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy against these refractory tumors. Our results provided a mechanistic rationale for the evolutionary selection of co-occurring <i>HER2\/HER3<\/i> mutations and the recent clinical observations that <i>HER3<\/i> mutations are associated with a lesser response to neratinib in HER2-mutant cancers.<br \/>More recently, we have turned our attention to acquired secondary mutations in <i>HER2 <\/i>found in <i>HER2-<\/i>mutant breast tumors progressing on neratinib-based therapy. Except for the HER2<sup>T798I<\/sup> gatekeeper mutation (Hanker et al., <i>Cancer Discovery<\/i> 2017), whether these secondary HER2 mutations are <u>causal<\/u> to neratinib resistance is not known. We hypothesized that secondary <i>HER2 <\/i>mutations augment HER2 pathway activation and promote neratinib resistance. We found that expression of acquired secondary mutations in HER2<sup>T862A <\/sup>and HER2<sup>L755S <\/sup>in breast epithelial cells, <i>in cis<\/i> with the primary HER2 mutation,<sup> <\/sup>enhanced HER2-induced signaling to both the PI3K\/AKT and MEK\/ERK pathways, and cell growth and invasion relative to cells expressing the primary HER2 mutation alone. The enhanced phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, and S6 in double-mutant cells was incompletely blocked by neratinib treatment, in contrast to cells expressing the primary HER2 mutation. In addition, cells expressing the double mutants exhibited &#62;5-fold higher IC<sub>50<\/sub> to neratinib and were able to form 3D Matrigel colonies and proliferate in 2D in 10-25 nM neratinib, whereas the growth of cells expressing the primary HER2 mutants was completely blocked at these concentrations. Computational modeling predicted that the active state of HER2 was stabilized in the HER2<sup>L869R\/T862A <\/sup>double-mutant relative to that of either single mutant. The overall energetic barrier for the active to inactive state transition also increased for the double mutant compared to that of each single mutant. Next, we screened 10 concentrations of 9 structurally distinct HER2 TKIs in breast epithelial cells expressing HER2 primary mutations (L869R or L755S), acquired secondary mutations (L869R\/L755S, L869R\/T862A, and L755S\/T862A), or the acquired gatekeeper mutation (L869R\/T798I). Cells expressing the gatekeeper mutation, which does <u>not<\/u> enhance HER2 activation\/signaling, but rather sterically blocks neratinib binding, were sensitive to 6\/9 TKIs (primarily smaller molecules than neratinib, that would be predicted to fit in the smaller binding pocket of HER2<sup>T798I<\/sup>). In contrast, the other double-mutant cells, which all displayed enhanced HER2-induced signaling, showed reduced sensitivity to all TKIs tested. This suggests that secondary acquired mutations in HER2 reduce sensitivity to neratinib primarily through an increased threshold of activation, such that higher concentrations of single-agent HER2 TKIs are needed to block HER2 activity. Therefore, we next asked which downstream pathways are important for the growth of HER2 double-mutant cells. In contrast to cells expressing HER2\/HER3 mutations, which did not enhance MEK\/ERK activation, cells expressing HER2 double-mutants were exquisitely sensitive to MEK inhibition by either selumetinib or trametinib in combination with a HER2 TKI, providing a potential treatment strategy for HER2-mutant breast cancers following progression on neratinib-based therapy.<br \/>In summary, we have shown that mutant HER2-induced signaling and oncogenic growth can be further boosted by co-occurring HER3 mutations or secondary HER2 mutations, either of whch results in reduced sensitivity to HER2 TKIs. The enhanced activation of the PI3K pathway (concurrent <i>HER2\/HER3<\/i> mutations or<i> HER2<\/i> insertion mutations) or of the MEK\/ERK pathway (secondary <i>HER2<\/i> mutations) can be therapeutically exploited in these genomically-defined tumor subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Precision medicine,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Neratinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ariella B.
