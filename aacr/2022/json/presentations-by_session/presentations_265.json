Mutations in the RAS oncogene occur across various cancer histologies and are found in about 30% of all cancer patients. These mutations play an essential role in tumor establishment and survival and are most commonly found in hotspots - specifically at amino acid positions 12, 13, and 61. We have recently treated a patient who underwent a durable objective response after receiving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that recognized a KRAS G12D mutation. T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize shared mutated RAS antigens presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules are thus promising reagents for &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; adoptive cell therapies (ACT) following insertion of the TCR into lymphocytes. We recently published a paper describing the discovery of anti-mutated RAS reactivities by using screening TIL and by performing in-vitro stimulation (IVS) of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Interestingly by those two methods, we sometimes found reactivity or TCR in a patient in one method but not with the other method. In this work, we described the discovery of anti-mutated RAS TCRs by TIL IVS, which combines the best of the two described methods: using TILs coming from the tumor and therefore assumed to have a higher proportion of anti-tumor-reactive cells and stimulate them, which could enrich smaller populations.<b> <\/b>The specific anti-mutated RAS CD4 and CD8 TCRs were isolated by coculture of the reactive T cells with dendritic cells (DC) loaded with peptides or transfected with mRNA encoding RAS mutated antigens. The reactive T cells were subjected to single-cell sequencing to identify TCRs. The TCRs were reconstructed as a viral plasmid and retrovirally transduced into PBLs. The transduced TCRs were tested for avidity, MHC restriction, and specific recognition of the mutation. In the same patients tested by both methods, by TIL IVS, identified 12 anti-mutated RAS TCRs in addition the 9 TCRs that we could find by TIL screening. Overall, we present here the discovery of multiple mutation-specific anti-RAS TCRs and its MHC class I and class II restriction elements involved in tumor recognition. Each of the newly discovered TCRs recognized mutated RAS with high avidity and specificity and low to no reactivity against wild-type RAS. Testing of the TCR transduced cells to recognize tumor cell lines in-vitro and in-vivo demonstrated tumor cell line recognition.<br \/>The anti-RAS mutated TCRs we discovered by all of our methods can potentially be used as an &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; treatment for the evaluation of TCR-based ACT in 45-60% of patients were tumor bears RAS mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Receptors,Ras,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Noam Levin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank J.

Approximately half of patients with refractory large B-cell lymphomas achieve durable responses from CD19-targeting CAR-T treatment, across the commercially available CAR-T products with differing designs. Known failure mechanisms such as antigen loss account for only a fraction of cases without durable responses, and this knowledge gap has limited advances in CAR-T engineering and optimal targeting to patients.<br \/>We hypothesized that characterization of the transcriptional programs and temporal evolution of CAR-T and host immune cell populations could provide novel insights into the basis of clinical response to CAR-T cell therapy for B cell lymphoma. We performed 10X single-cell RNA sequencing on serial samples collected from 32 individuals with high grade B cell lymphoma treated with the two first FDA-approved CD19 CAR-T products: axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel, utilizing a CD28z costimulatory domain) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel, with a 4-1BB domain). We analyzed 106 samples, including pre-infusion blood samples, infusion product, and post-infusion T cells sorted by flow cytometry into CAR+ and CAR- populations. Analyzing 602,577 single-cell transcriptomes, we discerned major differences in the dynamics of response of the two products. Tisa-cel responders showed dramatic expansion of CD8+ T cells at day 7 after infusion, which represented less than 10% of cells in the product. Conversely, CD8+ T cells in products of non-responders failed to expand to the same degree post-infusion and had a more effector- than memory-like T cell phenotype. In one tisa-cel&#8211;treated patient who had no CD8+ T cell expansion after initial infusion and relapsed at 6 months post-infusion, re-treatment with a second dose of the same product led to a durable response and was associated with greater CD8+ T cell expansion as well as a shift in CD4+ T phenotype from cytotoxic to helper. In contrast, axi-cel responders had pre-expanded effector populations distributed more heterogeneously among CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Finally, we identified nominal elevations in CAR-T regulatory cells (CAR-Tregs) among both axi-cel and tisa-cel non-responders in our dataset, which we confirmed in an external dataset. These small increases in CAR-Tregs were sufficient to uniformly suppress conventional CAR-T cell expansion and drive late relapses in an <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse model of lymphoma after treatment with CARs with either CD28z or 4-1BB co-stimulatory domains. In summary, this represents the largest CAR-T scRNAseq cohort established thus far and provides important insights into (i) the temporal dynamics of a successful CAR-T response, (ii) the molecular phenotypes of CAR-T cells with different costimulatory domains, and (iii) the capacity for small increases in CAR-Tregs to drive relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Single cell,Sequencing,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicholas J.

Previous work has demonstrated superior response rates with intraperitoneally (IP) directed therapies, providing the rationale for IP immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: A previously published model system in which OVCAR ovarian cancer spheroids are killed by IFN-activated human monocytes was further characterized using confocal microscopy, global gene expression analysis, flow cytometry, and knockout\/knockdown of key genes in the TRAIL-DR4\/DR5 pathway. These results were translated into a phase I dose escalation trial in which 3-6 patients with platinum-resistant or refractory ovarian cancer were enrolled into 4 cohorts and treated IP q28 days with Peginterferon alfa-2b (25-250 mcg) and Interferon gamma-1b (5-50 mcg), with or without autologous monocytes (75-750 x 106 cells), in order to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).<br \/>Results: Confocal microscopy of IFN-activated monocytes demonstrated migration into OVCAR spheroids and destruction of the spheroids and global gene expression analysis identified TRAIL as a ligand on monocytes upregulated by IFN treatment. Disruption of TRAIL receptors DR4\/DR5 or deletion of CASPASE8 on OVCAR cells largely abrogated killing. IFN-activated human monocytes were able to kill IP-injected OVCAR tumor cells in a mouse xenograft model, and IFN-activated monocytes from ovarian cancer patients were able to kill OVCAR spheroids as effectively as those from healthy donors. 18 patients were subsequently enrolled on a phase I trial (median age, 61 years; median 5 prior therapies). 1 of 3 patients at the second dose level experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 anemia) and no subsequent DLTs were observed. The RP2D was defined as 250mcg IFNa\/50mcg IFNg\/750 x 106 cells. The only treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events occurring in more than one patient were lymphocyte decrease (33.3%) and abdominal pain (11.1%). The best response observed was partial response (PR) in 2\/9 RECIST-evaluable patients, and 1 additional patient had a CA-125 response with &#62;50% reduction. 4\/9 patients had stable disease. Four patients were able to receive 5+ cycles (range 1-10 cycles). Biomarker analyses demonstrated that these long-term responders had a lower level of T-regulatory cells at baseline, but exhibited marked increase in myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) at the time of tumor progression.<br \/>Conclusion: These findings characterize the mechanism of a novel cellular immunotherapy for ovarian cancer which is well tolerated with evidence of clinical activity in a heavily pretreated patient population. This therapy may serve as the backbone for a combination immunotherapy regimen incorporating additional agents targeting T-regulatory cells and\/or MDSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Interferons,monocytes,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher B.

Our individualized neoantigen vaccine (GRANITE) has shown clinical benefit and strong, consistent CD8 T cell induction in patients. We have developed an analogous off-the-shelf product (SLATE) targeting shared neoantigens that offers manufacturing simplicity and faster administration to patients with shared driver mutations. A Phase 1\/2 trial of a heterologous prime\/boost vaccine regimen using a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) prime and self amplifying mRNA (SAM) boosts (SLATE, NCT03953235) was initiated to assess safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in patients with advanced cancers. SLATE version 1 encodes 20 unique neoantigens to various shared driver mutations (KRAS, TP53, etc.). Patients were selected if their tumors harbored one of the 20 neoantigens encoded by the vaccine cassette and an HLA Class I allele that presents that neoantigen. Administration of ChAd prime and repeated administration of 30, 100, or 300&#181;g SAM doses were safe and well tolerated in all subjects dosed (n=26), with no evidence of increasing reactogenicity with sequential dosing. Early efficacy signals (molecular responses; one unconfirmed RECIST response) were observed in NSCLC subjects all treated with and progressed on prior anti-PD(L)1. Analysis of T cell responses pre and post immunizations by <i>ex vivo<\/i> IFN&#947; ELISpot did not show robust responses to KRAS neoantigens across all patients. However, objective CD8 T cell responses to KRAS antigens post vaccination were detectable after <i>in vitro<\/i> stimulation, suggesting the induction of low-level KRAS specific T cell responses <i>in vivo<\/i>. In contrast, HLA-matched responses to TP53 neoantigens encoded by the vaccine were consistently detected via ex vivo ELISpot in these same patients. These data suggests that an immunodominant T cell response to the TP53 mutations may have outcompeted the response to the less immunogenic KRAS mutations restricted and presented by the same HLA<i> in vivo<\/i>. Differential surface peptide-HLA (pHLA) density may explain these discordant findings, and subsequent targeted mass spectrometry analyses revealed detection of TP53 pHLA complexes at a higher frequency compared to KRAS mutations in single HLA-allele cell lines. Redesigned vaccine cassettes excluding the TP53 epitopes and repeating KRAS epitopes demonstrated increased immune responses (<i>ex vivo<\/i> IFN&#947; ELISpot) compared to cassette version 1 in HLA transgenic mice, further supporting the tumor neoantigen immunodominance hierarchy observed in humans dosed with SLATE version 1. A re-designed product (SLATE v2) focusing exclusively on KRAS mutations (G12C, G12D, G12V and Q61H) is currently being assessed in phase 2 in patients with advanced KRAS-driven tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,KRAS,Immuno-oncology,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Amy R.

Immune profiling of peripheral blood from chemotherapy-resistant MSI-H uterine cancer patients treated with nivolumab identified a rapid proliferative CD8 T cell response 2-4 weeks post PD-1 blockade (N = 32). This immunological response, however, did not correlate with clinical response, suggesting additional parameters may be relevant. We focused on DNA damage and repair (DDR) in T cells as potential novel parameters. DDR has been extensively studied in the context of inducing cell death in highly-proliferating tumor cells. However, despite induction of rapid proliferation of T cells upon ICB, whether T cell-intrinsic DDR impacts T cell function, and how the coordination of DDR affects immunological and clinical response to ICBs have been largely unexplored. We hypothesized that the T celI-intrinsic DDR responses to proliferative and genotoxic stress might contribute to the disparity between immunological and clinical response. To test the hypothesis, we developed a novel high-dimensional cytometry platform. This DDR-Immune platform enables simultaneous analysis of T cell differentiation state with changes in major DDR pathways at single-cell resolution. The DDR-Immune platform revealed consistent T cell subset specific patterns of DDR, as well as specific DDR pathways induced by different types of DNA damage, such as &#947;-irradiation (IR), UV irradiation (UV) or proliferative stress (i.e. anti-CD3\/CD28 stimulation). For example, terminally differentiated effector T cells accumulated higher DNA damage and cell death. In contrast, stem cell memory (T<sub>SCM<\/sub>) and regulatory T cells (Treg) displayed high DDR with less cell death, suggesting that effective cell-intrinsic DDR against genotoxic stress in T cells confers a survival advantage. We applied the platform to MSI-H uterine cancer cohort to test if T cell-intrinsic DDR distinguish the clinical response. Indeed, we found that in clinical responders but not clinical non-responders, Ki67+ CD8 T cells responding to PD-1 blockade exhibited rapid induction of DDR represented as a spike increase of phosphorylated-ATM (pATM). This likely indicates the T cell &#8216;fitness&#8217; response to proliferative stress induced by PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, patients with higher induction of pATM in responding CD8 T cells at the peak of the immunological response to PD-1 blockade had longer progression-free survival (PFS). Collectively, the new platform reveals previously unrecognized roles for T cell-intrinsic DDR as a novel determinant of immune responsiveness and clinical outcome to ICB and has potential application to other cancer therapies including chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,DNA damage response,Biomarkers,Mismatch repair deficiency,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuki Muroyama<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sasikanth Manne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derek A.

While our understanding of the biology underlying immunotherapy in NSCLC is still incomplete, studies to date have established central roles for Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (PDL1-TPS). In order to expand our understanding of the molecular features underlying response in NSCLC, we describe here the first joint analysis of the Stand Up 2 Cancer-Mark Foundation (SU2C-MARK) Cohort, a collection of 393 patients with whole exome and\/or RNA sequencing along with matched checkpoint blockade response annotation. We identify a number of significant associations between molecular features and response, including: 1) favorable and unfavorable genomic subgroups; 2) distinct immune infiltration signatures associated with wound healing (unfavorable) and immune activated (favorable) microenvironments; and 3) a novel de-differentiated tumor-intrinsic subtype characterized by high TMB, immune activation, and enhanced response rate. Taken together, results from this cohort extend our understanding of NSCLC-specific predictors, providing a rich set of molecular and immunologic hypotheses with which to further our understanding of the biology of checkpoint blockade in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Immunotherapy,NSCLC,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arvind Ravi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Gainor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Arniella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chip Stewart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Freeman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark M.

Despite the survival rate of 90% for newly diagnosed children with ALL, the outcome for relapsed patients is historically poor with a less than 30% survival. CD19 CAR T-cell therapy (CART19) has shown remarkable response rates, between 80-90% in relapsed\/refractory disease. Little is known about antigen-independent factors that predict initial resistance to CART19. We hypothesized that leukemias that are resistant to CART19 are distinct from sensitive leukemias and that these differences can be detected prior to therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To interrogate differences between resistant and sensitive leukemias, we obtained pre-treatment bone marrow aspirates (BMAs) from patients enrolled in a clinical trial at Seattle Children&#8217;s Hospital (PLAT-02). Samples were categorized based on patient response, with non-response defined as not achieving and maintaining minimal residual disease negativity at Day +63. Our study included 7 resistant and 7 sensitive leukemias as controls. We performed whole exome sequencing, bulk RNA-seq, PacBio-seq of the <i>CD19 <\/i>locus, array-based methylation, ATAC-seq, scRNA-seq, and CyTOF.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found that non-response to CART19 is independent of leukemic subtype. Despite blasts being CD19+ in all patients by flow cytometry, we identified alternative splicing of <i>CD19<\/i> in one non-responder, while the remaining non-responders expressed high levels of wildtype <i>CD19<\/i>. We discovered a distinctive DNA methylation pattern in the non-responders characterized by hypermethylation of PRC2 targets in embryonic and cancer stem cells (<i>p<\/i> = 8.15E-25) Furthermore, using gene set enrichment analysis of ATAC-seq data, we found increased accessibility of chromatin at regions associated with stem cell proliferation (NES = 2.31; <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001) and cell cycling (NES = 2.27; <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001). We found a greater similarity between accessibility patterns of non-responders to hematopoietic progenitors, including hematopoietic stem cells (<i>p<\/i> = 0.037) and common myeloid progenitors (<i>p<\/i> = 0.047). These findings were supported by an increased frequency of cell subpopulations expressing a multi-lineage phenotype (CD19, CD20, CD33, CD34; <i>p<\/i> = 0.009). Moreover, we find decreased expression of antigen presentation and processing pathways across all leukemic cells relative to responders (<i>p<\/i> = 0.0001).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This study, one of the most comprehensive multi-omic analyses of samples from patients treated with CAR T-cells, identified resistance mechanisms that can be detected prior to treatment. We report the novel association of a stem cell phenotype, lineage plasticity, and decreased antigen presentation with resistance. These results support further refinement of eligibility for CART19 for children with leukemia and highlights the need for alternative of complimentary approaches for these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Resistance,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katherine E.
