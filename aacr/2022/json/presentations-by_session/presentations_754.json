[{"Abstract":"Background: Effective target discovery strategies are key to developing new precision medicines against cancer. Large-scale efforts to systematically characterize cancer-associated germline variants, genomic changes in tumors and cancer genetic dependencies <i>via<\/i> CRISPR and RNAi in cell lines provide valuable resources for machine learning (ML) approaches designed to identify disease-modifying targets. However, fundamental challenges remain in understanding how various data types (including primary tumor and cell line data) can be jointly modeled to decipher the molecular network contexts underpinning the biology and efficacy of new target candidates.<br \/>Approach: Using a data-driven knowledge graph spanning &#62;2 billion relations over &#62;350,000 biomedical entities, we assembled a comprehensive target prioritization resource with 53 feature types including multi-omics (germline and tumor) and genetic dependency data. Feature categories consisted of raw feature types (e.g. germline genetic, somatic mutation, copy number variation, transcriptomic, proteomic, survival associations, CRISPR\/RNAi sensitivity, selectivity, efficacy and essentiality), network-transformed features capturing the underlying molecular network context of each possible target, and multidimensional network integration features combining systems-level information from multiple feature types. Multiple ML models were trained on either omics-based features only or on both omics and genetic dependency features; and using information from each cancer type separately, as well as jointly in multi-disease models.<br \/>Results: Individual features and the resulting ML models were evaluated using known drug targets in 20 cancer types. We found that a) germline genetic and survival association features along with genetic dependency (efficacy and selectivity) features were the most predictive prior to network transformation; b) network-based feature transformation raised the predictive power of individual features (e.g. increasing mean AUPRC from 0.024 to 0.064 for germline genetic and from 0.018 to 0.048 for cell line sensitivity features); c) network integration of multiple feature types increased mean AUPRC by 21% over the best individual omics features; d) ML models integrating both omics and genetic dependency data outperformed ML omics-only approaches (mean AUPRC 0.219 vs. 0.195); and e) multi-disease ML models provided the best overall performance (mean AUPRC 0.232) underlining the value of multi-dimensional data integration and information transfer across cancer types. Resulting network-based machine learning models provide a highly interpretable view into the top-scoring genes for each cancer, prioritizing established targets, targets recently being evaluated (e.g. FGFR2 and FGFR3 in lung squamous cell carcinoma) and novel target candidates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d9a80ddd-5b58-4101-98bd-97adf46564ce\/@v03B8ZXf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Target discovery,Machine learning,Systems biology,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Janusz Dutkowski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rados&#322;aw Bielecki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karol Niena&#322;towski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Micha&#322; Kukie&#322;ka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roy Ronen<\/i><\/presenter>.

In recent years, quantitative analysis, including artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, have been applied to facilitate the evaluation of histopathologic images. Research in computational pathology comes with numerous engineering challenges: from management of whole slide images (WSIs) and their metadata, collection of expert annotations, data manipulation and feature extraction, to AI model training and evaluation of the results. These challenges span multiple departments and sets of expertise; there is a lack of an efficient system that helps manage and process histologic images and supports AI analysis. In particular, computational oncology requires significant compute resources. The need for an integrated platform with systematic processes to manage the job parameters and complex workflows that interface with multidisciplinary teams is critical for successful experiments and reproducible research. To address these challenges, we developed Luna Pathology, an open-source library and platform for computational pathology research. With flexibility, scalability, and FAIR data principles in mind, Luna Pathology was designed to provide 1) reusable workflows and modular tools for end-to-end pathology analysis 2) FAIR datasets for reproducible research and 3) a collaborative open-source research platform. Namely, Luna Pathology features support data management, annotation support, image processing, image and annotation visualization, feature extraction, and human-in-the-loop machine learning. A description of the Luna Pathology platform, its supporting computational infrastructure, and its integration within the standard computational pathology will be presented. Luna Pathology meets data processing and management needs, as well data analysis experiments and reproducible AI research on a flexible data platform. Its workflows have been deployed in colorectal, neuroblastoma and ovarian cancer projects at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) to derive new insights from ~10,000 WSIs. We additionally present a view of the Luna Pathology platform as part of the institutional effort to bridge computational research and clinical care at MSK. The integrated open platform brings together a multidisciplinary team of pathologists, computational biologists, and bioinformatics engineers to more effectively collaborate on iterative large-scale computational pathology research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/be2c0855-b3e6-4221-bdea-041ebd46569d\/@v03B8ZXf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histopathology,Deep learning,Image analysis,Computational Pathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Doori Rose<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Aukerman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Druv Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arfath Pasha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Armaan Kohli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignacio Vázquez-García<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Boehm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rami Vanguri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Shabet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vassiliki Mancoridis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Zakszewski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Gross<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Fong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pegah Khosravi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sohrab Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>JianJiong Gao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, we discovered a panel of 8 fusion genes that occurred in aggressive prostate cancer. In order to make the fusion gene test clinically ready as a predictor, we have modified to test into a semi-quantitative Taqman QRT-PCR. In the funding period, Two hundred seventy-one prostate cancer samples with clinical follow-up were collected from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In addition, 194 prostate cancer samples from University of Wisconsin, Madison and 108 prostate cancer samples from Stanford University were collected. Taqman QRT-PCRs were performed on these samples. Significant numbers of samples were found positive for some of these fusion genes. The expression of MAN2A1-FER, SLC45A2-AMACR, MTOR-TP53BP1 fusions are associated with prostate cancer recurrence in the UPMC cohort. Cross-validation showed that fusion gene model predicts up to 91% clinical outcomes of prostate cancer accurately. When cohorts of UPMC, Stanford and Wisconsin were combined, the accuracy is 74%. The combination of fusion with Gleason appeared to improve the overall accuracy from 77% (Gleason) to 92% (Gleason+fusion) in the UPMC cohort, and from 71% (Gleason) to 82% (Gleason+fusion) when all three cohorts are combined. When fusion combined with both pathology stage and Gleason, the accuracy was improved a little further: 93% accuracy in the UPMC cohort and 83% when all three cohorts are combined. In summary, fusion transcript prediction model may have a role in prostate cancer prognosis prediction and guiding the management of prostate cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3923f0ee-867d-4598-ad40-59b57e330c82\/@w03B8ZXg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-07 Sequence analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Recurrence,Machine learning,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jian-Hua Luo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan-Ping Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Further improvement of current HER2 targeting therapeutics on safety and efficacy remains to be desired. Deep learning - based computational approach, such as AlphaFold, has been successfully applied to the understanding of protein structure. However, its applications to protein therapeutic design remain largely underdeveloped. Method: We have developed an end-to-end protein design engine <i>Apollo, <\/i>which can be used to design target-binding protein therapeutics <i>in silico<\/i>. <i>Apollo<\/i> uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers and graph convolution neural networks (GCNs) to represent proteins, protein structures and protein-protein interactions. This is further improved by multi-head and hierarchical attention layers. Using generative AI, <i>Apollo<\/i> can either generate putative binding proteins <i>de novo,<\/i> or to optimize protein lead molecules. Candidate proteins are evaluated <i>in silico<\/i> for binding affinity and specificity, secondary and tertiary structure, isoelectric point, solubility, and other drug-like properties. Generated designs are iteratively improved by <i>Apollo<\/i> via a reinforcement learning loop. Results: <i>Apollo<\/i> has achieved high prediction accuracy by <i>in silico<\/i> evaluations, using metrics such as AUC and the confusion matrices. Using <i>Apollo<\/i>, we then designed mini protein binders of 50~100 aa to target HER2 extracellular domain (ECD). These binders can be produced with high yield and purity using mammalian protein expression systems. From <i>de novo<\/i> generation, the designed candidates are shown to bind to human HER2 with EC50 in the nanomolar range by ELISA. From optimizations based on lead molecules, the designed candidates have shown improved production yield and thermostability while maintaining binding affinity.

Yet the field lacks a clear consensus on the appropriate level of confidence to place in variant impact and interpretation methods, for both well-established oncogenes as well as less understood genes. The Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI, \\'k&#257;-j&#275;\\) is a community experiment to objectively assess computational methods for predicting the phenotypic impacts of genomic variation. CAGI participants are provided genetic variants and make blind predictions of resulting phenotype. Independent assessors evaluate the predictions by comparing them against experimental and clinical data. Six CAGI editions involving over 60 experiments have taken place to date. Results have been described in two special issues of <i>Human Mutation <\/i>(vol. 38(9) and vol. 40(9)). About a quarter of CAGI experiments have involved genes implicated in cancer, including variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, the MRN complex (RAD50, MRE11, and NBS1), FXN, NSMCE2 (coding for SUMO ligase), NPM-ALK CDKN2A, PTEN, TPMT, STK11, p16 and TP53. In the ENIGMA consortium challenge, a total of 326 germline BRCA1\/BRCA2 missense and in-frame indel variants were provided. The most successful predictions achieved a ROC AUC of 0.94 and were derived from a metapredictor that explicitly considered the population frequency of each variant, trained on cancer data, and included the role of altered splicing. In challenges exploring the role of protein stability in cancer progression, biophysical and structure-based methods are among the top performers and have provided insights into underlying molecular mechanisms. This was the case for the p16 challenge involving variants of unknown significance in familial malignant melanoma, the PTEN and TPMT challenges that measured variant effect on protein stability via intracellular abundance in a high-throughput assay, and the p53 rescue challenge in which predictors managed to successfully identify a handful of double mutants, among a set of 14,668 total variants, that reactivated the damaged protein. Cancer challenges involving breast cancer pharmacogenomics, case-controls, splicing and polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been moderately successful but show promise for the future. A key finding from CAGI is that for most missense challenges, including cancer, it is possible to relate phenotype values to a pathogenicity threshold, and so deduce potential performance in a clinical setting. The results suggest that computational methods are generally more reliable than recognized in the current clinical use guidelines, warranting a reevaluation of their role in clinical variant interpretation. Results from the ENIGMA and other BRCA challenges support this observation but more data are needed. Overall, CAGI has helped establishing the state of art in genome interpretation, encouraged new methodological developments, and informed the clinical application of computational predictors.

The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) grading system, based on the percentages of growth patterns within the tumour, is highly prognostic (Moreira et al. 2020). However, the clinicopathological significance of transitions between growth patterns, and the combinatorial effects of growth pattern and inflammatory cell infiltration are not yet known. We used a deep learning model to delineate six growth patterns (lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, solid, and cribriform) at pixel level on hematoxylin and eosin diagnostic whole slide images. The model was trained on 49 slides from the TRACERx cohort (AbdulJabbar et al. 2020), and subsequently applied to 4324 slides from 970 adenocarcinoma cases from the Leicester Archival Thoracic Tumor Investigatory Cohort (Moore et al. 2019). To examine how tumor growth patterns are spatially intermixed, we created a graph network of growth patterns. A linking criterion based on effective cell-cell communication distance was established, whereby adjacent compact tumor islands were linked together. Frequencies of 15 types of pairwise links were further evaluated. A higher intermixing score, measured as the Shannon diversity of link percentages, was associated with adverse relapse free survival (RFS) (p&#60;0.001, Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.5, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=1.3-1.8, n=966), independently of automated IASLC grading (p=0.001, HR=1.4, 95% CI=1.1-1.7). The clinical relevance of intermixing profiles was investigated by clustering patients into 3 groups, based on the similarity between link percentages. The group dominated by links involving high grade patterns (solid, micropapillary, cribriform), showed the highest risk of relapse (p&#60;0.001, HR=1.7, 95% CI=1.4-2.2), followed by the group enriched with papillary-acinar links (p=0.006, HR=1.4, 95% CI=1.1-1.7). Although micropapillary subtype <i>per se<\/i> confers an unfavorable prognosis (Cao et al. 2016), its association with papillary morphology increased the risk of relapse (p=0.002, HR=4.2, 95% CI=1.6-11.0), independently of micropapillary burden. To investigate the immune microenvironment surrounding growth patterns, we quantified immune cells at the interface between growth patterns. We observed significantly reduced immune infiltration between micropapillary and papillary than between micropapillary and acinar, solid, and cribriform patterns (p&#60;0.001). In conclusion, we showed that tumor growth pattern spatial intermixing is associated with adverse prognosis and immune infiltration. These findings offer novel insights into the spatial interplay of histological phenotypes and its clinical relevance, which may have an impact on immune escape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/284be3fe-6a66-4bfb-b27a-0c7be5242f91\/@w03B8ZXg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology and artificial intelligence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Histopathology,Deep learning,Graph representation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anca-Ioana Grapa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanyun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoxi Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khalid AbdulJabbar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Coelho-Lima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ho Kwan Alvin Cheung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah J.
