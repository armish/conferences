[{"Abstract":"TLT2 (TREML2, Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells Like transcript 2) is a single-pass type I membrane protein that contains an immunoglobulin-like domain. Previous studies have shown that TLT2 is up-regulated in response to inflammation in macrophages, suggesting a potential role in the pro-inflammatory response. However, the function of TLT2 in immune cells and crosstalk of cells expressing TLT2 with other immune cells, e.g., T cells, have not been studied. Therefore, we tried to search immune cells expressing TLT2 and explore the effect of TLT2 on T cell activity. T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion assays using TLT2 recombinant protein showed that TLT2 significantly inhibits T cells proliferation and cytokine secretion (IFN gamma and TNF alpha) more than PD-L1. Since TLT2 can act as an immune checkpoint protein, FACS analysis was performed on various cancer cell lines and immune cells to confirm the expression of TLT2. TLT2 was commonly expressed on human and mouse B cells but not cancer cells. Additionally, we found that TLT2 was expressed on human and mouse regulatory B cells (Bregs). Bregs represent a subpopulation of B cells that inhibit effector T cells but induce regulatory T cells and attenuate the anti-tumor effect of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Bregs are also closely related to various clinicopathological factors and the survival rates of cancer patients. In particular, Bregs are observed to be high in the patient group not responding to the administration of immunotherapy. Therefore, Bregs could be a potential therapeutic target for immunotherapy of cancer patients. For <i>in vivo<\/i> function study of TLT2, we inoculated cancer cells in <i>TLT2<\/i> WT (wild-type) and KO (knockout) mice and monitored the tumor growth. The size of tumors inoculated in <i>TLT2<\/i> KO mice was reduced compared to <i>TLT2 <\/i>WT mice. In addition, the total population of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and the population of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells that produce cytokines (IFN gamma and TNF alpha) were increased in the spleen and tumor-infiltrated lymphocyte of the <i>TLT2<\/i> KO mice. Finally, we investigated the potential of TLT2 as a cancer immunotherapeutic target using a GENA-105S05, a monoclonal antibody against mouse Tlt2. GENA-105S05 significantly inhibited tumor growth in the MC38 syngeneic mouse tumor model. Further investigation on the function of TLT2 expressed in the Bregs and the development of a monoclonal antibody targeting TLT2 could lead to novel therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/52790681-871f-4788-8382-d99ba289f4f5\/@D03B8ZG2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Immuno-oncology,B cells,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16837"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mi Young Cha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Bu-Nam Jeon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunsuk Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seungmin Byun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Areum Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joo-Yeon Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanggyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyung Mi Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hansoo Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

M6223 is a fully human antagonistic anti-TIGIT antibody in immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 format with Fc-mediated effector function. Preclinical studies demonstrated that M6223 could induce an anti-tumor immune response by complementary mechanisms including but not limited to direct blockade of the TIGIT pathway, stimulation of CD226 dimerization\/activation, and depletion of TIGIT+ immune subsets by Fc-mediated effector function. M6223 showed dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in multiple preclinical tumor models. Bintrafusp alfa, a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of the human transforming growth factor &#946; receptor II (TGF-&#946;RII or TGF-&#946; \"trap\") fused via a flexible linker to the C-terminus of each heavy chain of an IgG1 antibody blocking programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1), was designed to target two key immunosuppressive pathways in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To attenuate the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, the anti-tumor immunity and efficacy of combining M6223 with bintrafusp alfa was investigated in syngeneic models in humanized mice with huTIGIT knock-in sequences.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> M6223 combined with bintrafusp alfa significantly enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and extended survival compared with either monotherapies or the combination of M6223 with anti-PD-L1. M6223 combined with bintrafusp alfa stimulated higher CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells infiltration, proliferation and cytotoxicity in tumor microenvironment in comparison to the combination of M6223 with anti-PD-L1. The ratio of CD8+ T cells to regulatory T cells and the ratio of CD226 to TIGIT were significantly increased, indicating the conversion of the tumor microenvironment from an immuno-suppressive phenotype to a more immune-permissive phenotype. With the combination therapy, bintrafusp alfa was the main driver promoting CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell proliferation, infiltration, and cytotoxicity. Alternatively, adding M6223 to bintrafusp alfa may decrease the risk of immune resistance caused by elevated TIGIT expression triggered by bintrafusp alfa treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These complementary mechanisms of M6223 and bintrafusp alfa orchestrate antitumor activity in preclinical tumor models.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PD-1 blockade has drastically improved melanoma patient survival, but not all patients respond to ICB. Elevated expression of inhibitory molecules on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells dampens the antitumor T cell response and limits patient response to ICB. We recently showed that the inhibitory receptor Fc&#947;RIIB is expressed on effector-like memory CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and functions in a cell-intrinsic manner to temper activated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. We found that Fc&#947;RIIB<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were more proliferative and secreted more pro-inflammatory cytokines than their Fc&#947;RIIB<sup>- <\/sup>counterparts. Fc&#947;RIIB<sup>+ <\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells also expressed elevated levels of exhaustion\/activation markers (PD-1, CTLA-4, etc.). As these markers are also the targets of immune checkpoint blockade, we investigated the response of these cells to checkpoint therapy. Interestingly, Fc&#947;RIIB<sup>+ <\/sup>cells exhibited significantly reduced proliferation to &#945;PD-1 and &#945;CTLA-4 <i>in vitro<\/i> compared to Fc&#947;RIIB<sup>- <\/sup>cells (p&#60;0.05). In stage-IV melanoma patients, we observed a decrease in Fc&#947;RIIB<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (p&#60;0.05) following administration of nivolumab (&#945;PD-1), a finding replicated in mouse models <i>in vivo.<\/i> Because ICB utilizes IgG antibody, a canonical ligand for Fc&#947;Rs, we hypothesized that ICB antibodies could bind Fc&#947;RIIB<sup> <\/sup>on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and elicit counterproductive negative signaling. In a B16-melanoma mouse model, genetic deletion of Fc&#947;RIIB on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell infiltration and IFN&#947; production at the tumor in &#945;PD-1 treated mice (p&#60;0.05).

Thus, we show that Fc&#947;RIIB is a novel inhibitory molecule on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells that limits<sup> <\/sup>T-cell responsiveness to &#945;PD-1 immunotherapy and that T cell-expressed Fc&#947;RIIB should be a consideration in the development of therapeutic antibodies.

Nevertheless, not all patients respond to ICB. It is possible that regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a role in this lack of response by suppressing tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells, however the specific mechanisms that lead to this suppression remain elusive. It is therefore necessary to understand the functional programming and suppressive nature of Treg subsets in the tumor microenvironment to define targetable molecules for future biomarker-driven therapeutics. In this study we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on T cells isolated from resected tissue and peripheral blood from 15 neoadjuvant nivolumab (anti-PD1)-treated and 10 untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We identified and analyzed 71,251 CD4+ FoxP3+ Tregs. Refined clustering was performed, and we used pseudotime and differential gene analyses to understand the transcriptional relationship between clusters and patient groups. With our highly refined clustering approach, we identified 8 separate Treg clusters that reflect differing functionalities within the tumor microenvironment. We demonstrate distinct Treg subsets that diverge towards either an activated state, expressing members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily: OX40, 41BB, GITR, or a resting state. Patients who respond to ICI have a decreased activated Treg score and demonstrate RNA velocity trajectory from activated Tregs towards more in-active and resting populations. Untreated patients conversely show a high activated Treg score with RNA velocity demonstrating activated Tregs are a terminal differentiation state. We hypothesize that ICI treatment pushes Tregs away from an activated phenotype towards more quiescent and that the efficiency of this transition may predict response to ICI. We plan to stimulate receptors associated with non-response using TNFR agonist ligands and hypothesize that their induced signaling will result in transcriptional program changes altering the suppressive ability of Tregs. In addition, we show that Tregs who experience antigen within the tumor microenvironment are more suppressive than bystander Tregs that home to the tumor without antigen stimulation. Together, this study provides an in-depth look at the Treg-derived suppressive mechanisms governing their function in the TME of anti-PD-1-treated vs. untreated tumors. This in-depth analysis of tumor Tregs has identified specific targetable biomarkers which could be used to improve ICB response while mitigating off-target immune adverse events by specifically inhibiting a small subset of Tregs without disturbing systemic immune homeostasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d4b99f07-6171-46aa-b55a-68a50a1bc5fa\/@D03B8ZG2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,Nivolumab,OX40,Antigen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16840"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arbor G.

In most cancer cells, IOH-001 was demonstrated to have a lower EC<sub>50<\/sub> than the parental antibodies and to be bound in a dose-dependent manner as well. Interestingly, IOH-001 also has shown the selectivity to bind only to cancer cells even under the conditions of co-culturing RBC and cancer cells. IOH-001 has induced phagocytosis of cancer cells by human blood CD14+ monocyte-derived macrophages. Since IOH-001 is an IgG1 type antibody, ADCC and IFN-r expression have been increased compared with the parental antibodies. Consistent with the in vitro data, IOH-001 has more strongly suppressed tumor growth than the combination treatment of the parental antibodies in a dose-dependent manner in syngeneic animal models. Moreover, the tumor of the CR mouse has been identified not to be re-generated in the re-challenge model.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>IOH-001, dual-blockage of anti-CD47 and anti-PD-L1, has shown the benefits in treating some solid tumors. Bispecific antibody IOH-001 is more likely to work better in targeting tumor cells than the combination of anti-CD47 and anti-PD-L1. Preclinical efficacy results of IOH-001 provide a strong rationale for assessing therapeutic potential in clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7978f11b-cd79-446a-9c28-b06a9b3806a6\/@D03B8ZG2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,CD47,Bispecific antibody,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16842"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeong-kook Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>A-Ra Jeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jihyun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Yea Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Eun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Kwang Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Hye Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heewook Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Hye Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Hye Yun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoen Hee Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heung Tae Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

To be able to assess more marker in a large patient cohort, we have developed a BLEACH&#38;STAIN multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry approach that enabled the simultaneous analysis of 15 biomarkers. To study the relationship of PD-L1 expression on multiple different cell types and the relationship with various lymphocyte subtypes, PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA-4, panCK, CD68, CD163, CD11c, iNOS, CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3, CD20, Ki67, and CD31 were analyzed in 3098 tumor samples from 44 different tumor types. An artificial intelligence-based framework - incorporating three different deep learning systems - for automated marker quantification on tumor as well as immune cells was further established to study the spatial interplay between PD-L1<sup> <\/sup>expression and the composition of tumor infiltrating leucocytes (TILs). Comparing the automated deep learning-based PD-L1 quantification with conventional brightfield PD-L1 data revealed a high concordance in tumor cells (p&#60;0.0001) as well as immune cells (p&#60;0.0001) and an accuracy of the automated PD-L1 quantification ranging from 90% to 95.2%. Unsupervised clustering showed that a major proportion of the three PD-L1 phenotypes (i.e., PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor and immune cells [G1], PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells [G2], PD-L1 negative [G3]) were either inflamed (G1.1, G2.1, G3.1) or non-inflamed (G1.2, G2.2, G3.2). In the inflamed PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> patients (G.1.1), spatial analysis revealed that an elevated intratumoral CD68<sup>+<\/sup>CD163<sup>+<\/sup> M2 macrophages as well as CD11c<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cell infiltration (p&#60;0.001 each) was associated with a high (CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>&#177;<\/sup>CD8<sup>&#177;<\/sup>FOXP3<sup>&#177;<\/sup>) T-cell exclusion and a high PD-1 expression on T-cells (p&#60;0.001 each). In breast cancer, a particular poor prognosis for the non-inflamed PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancer patients (G1.2, G2.2) was found and the PD-L1 fluorescence intensity on tumor cells showed a significantly higher predictive performance for overall survival with an area under receiver operating curves (AUC) of 0.72 (p&#60;0.001) than the percentage of PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells (AUC: 0.54). In conclusion, BLEACH&#38;STAIN mfIHC in combination with a deep learning-based framework for automated PD-L1 assessment on tumor and immune cells enabled a rapid and comprehensive assessment of PD-L1 expression in different cell types and their interrelation with inflammatory cells. Our approach enabled the identification of six major PD-L1 phenotypes ranging from an PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cell inflamed phenotype (G1.1) with a spatial T-cell exclusion to a non-inflamed PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> immune cell phenotype showing a particular poor prognosis (G2.2) to a non-inflamed PD-L1 negative phenotype (G3.2).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40d10329-7390-49db-ac82-34c4bcdf2890\/@v03B8ZG3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Immunohistochemistry,PD-L1,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16843"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elena Bady<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katharina Möller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Mandelkow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald Simon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maximilian Lennartz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Hube-Magg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guido Sauter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niclas C.

CBL-B inhibition lowers the threshold of antigen-specific T cell activation, even in absence of co-stimulatory signaling or the presence of an immune suppressive environment. Genetic ablation of Cbl-b or functional inactivation of its E3 ligase activity in mice or primary human T cells enhances immune-mediated tumor growth control. Therefore, CBL-B inhibition may address the suboptimal response to current immunotherapies due to low inflammation, no\/low co-stimulation signal or a high immune suppressive environment. We have identified a series of potent allosteric CBL-B inhibitors via the application of our proprietary Smart Allostery<sup>TM<\/sup> platform. Herein we demonstrate one of our lead CBL-B inhibitors showed superior activity compared to a competitor CBL-B inhibitor&nbsp;(NX-519) in both biochemical and cellular assays. At similar exposures in a syngeneic mouse tumor model (CT26), our CBL-B inhibitor also demonstrated an increase in tumor growth inhibition relative to NX-519. Mechanistically, our CBL-B inhibitor not only enhanced T cell activation, but also re-invigorated exhaustive T cells and caused resistance to T regulatory cell-mediated suppression, both in a concentration-dependent manner. We further demonstrated differentiation of CBL-B inhibition versus anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay. Our CBL-B inhibitor significantly promoted T cell proliferation where anti-PD1 alone and anti-CTLA4 alone did not. Both anti-PD1 and CBL-B inhibition increased IFN&#947; production in this MLR assay, but that effect was further enhanced in combination. Together, the pre-clinical data presented here provided evidence of a differentiated profile of our allosteric CBL-B inhibitors to enhance key parameters associated with T cell activation and reduce susceptibility to immune suppression, supporting their further progression toward clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a261975-adea-46f0-a7ff-1ce2bda2e3e9\/@v03B8ZG3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Casitas B-Lineage Lymphoma Proto-Oncogene B (CBL-B),PD-1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16844"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yilin Qi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Kuai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingzhi Bi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huadong Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deborah G.

Nevertheless, a significant proportion of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint blockades are still largely unsatisfied with the benefits of these drugs. One of the reasons is that cancer cells also use other immune checkpoints such as lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3. LAG-3 negatively regulates activated T cells. In this study, we screened phage displayed-peptide libraries for peptides that selectively bind to LAG-3. After five rounds of screening, we selected a candidate peptide and named it LAG3Pep. LAG3Pep preferentially bound to human LAG-3-transfected HEK 293T cells over mock-transfected cells and phorbol myristate acetate\/ionomycin\/chloroquine-stimulated Jurkat T cells over unstimulated cells. LAG3Pep also bound to splenocytes isolated from tumor-bearing mice, suggesting the reactivity across human and mouse LAG-3. Pull-down of Jurkat T cell lysates using biotin-labeled LAG3Pep yielded a protein band of LAG-3. A competition by the pre-treatment of Jurkat T cells with a LAG-3-blocking antibody inhibited the cell binding of LAG3Pep. In addition, LAG3Pep inhibited the binding of LAG-3 protein to THP-1 cells expressing HLA-DR, a well-known LAG-3 ligand. Moreover, LAG3Pep recovered IL2 production by stimulated Jurkat T cells, which were suppressed by fibrinogen-like protein 1, another ligand of LAG-3, in the culture medium of HepG2 tumor cells. These results show that LAG3Pep selectively binds to LAG-3 and has a potential as a LAG-3 blocker for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/05371516-0ce6-4956-8bf5-4221edd74d85\/@v03B8ZG3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Phage display,LAG-3,LAG3Pep,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16845"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seok-Min Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byungheon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

The use of Antibodies to target immune checkpoints, particularly PD-1\/PD-L1, has made a profound impact in cancer immunotherapy. Single-domain antibody fragment (sdAb) is an antibody fragment composed of a single variable domain of the heavy chain. sdAb is the smallest antibody fragment (15 kDa) that maintains the similar antigen-binding affinity. sdAbs show many advantages over monoclonal antibodies such as small size, low immunogenicity, ease of production, and ease of modification, making sdAbs promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we use a phage display library to identify an anti-PD-L1 sdAb (CLV3) which effectively blocks the PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction. The CLV3 sdAb demonstrates high binding affinity and specificity to PD-L1 protein and PD-L1 overexpression DU145 tumor cells. Moreover, the CLV3 sdAb exhibits efficient tumor penetration in a 3D tumor spheroid model, suggesting its good penetration capability in the tumor microenvironment <i>in vivo<\/i>. CLV3 restores T cell proliferation and reduces T cell apoptosis in the co-culture experiment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with tumor cells. These data suggest that the CLV3 sdAb can be potentially used as an anti-PD-L1 inhibitor for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e6e96c53-5581-4782-9aa7-b645c8c8666a\/@v03B8ZG3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,PD-L1,Single-domain antibody,Phage display,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16846"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanli Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kun Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the plasticity of myeloid cells may enable therapeutic intervention. The immune inhibitory receptor LILRB2 (also known as ILT4) is expressed primarily by myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils), and has emerged as a key myeloid checkpoint contributing to the tolerogenic activity of myeloid cells associated with cancer. LILRB2 has several ligands (classical and non-classical MHC-I, ANGPTL2\/5, SEMA4A and CD1) and most of these are known to contribute to immune suppression in the TME. Using computational biology approaches, we found that high <i>LILRB2<\/i> expression is associated with macrophage infiltration in many solid tumor types from TCGA. Therefore, LILRB2 is a compelling target to overcome immune suppressive activity of cancer-associated myeloid cells. IO-108 is a fully human IgG4 therapeutic antibody that binds to LILRB2 with high affinity and specificity. IO-108 binds to all myeloid cells in the solid TME and periphery. In vitro studies support that blockade of LILRB2 interaction with its various ligands is the anticipated mechanism of action of IO-108. The LILRB2 antagonist activity of IO-108 produces the desired pro-inflammatory (re)polarization of myeloid cells. IO-108 treatment results in increased pro-inflammatory responses and an enhanced antigen-presenting cell (APC) phenotype to multiple stimuli (e.g., T cell activators, STING and TLR agonists) in ex vivo assays. In addition, IO-108 precludes the anti-inflammatory myeloid cell phenotype resulting from &#8220;tumor conditioning&#8221; and promotes the differentiation of monocytes and immature dendritic cells (DC) into pro-inflammatory DC. IO-108 enhances the effect of PD-1 blocking antibodies in allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactions of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and macrophages. Moreover, IO-108 polarized primary myeloid cells isolated from solid tumor patient blood and ovarian cancer-associated ascites towards a proinflammatory phenotype and attenuated their suppressive effect on autologous T cell proliferation and production of proinflammatory cytokines. In vivo, IO-108 inhibits tumor growth in mouse models, which is associated with immune cell activation. Importantly, IO-108 presents a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile in preclinical models. Collectively, the preclinical characterization of IO-108 enabled a comprehensive clinical biomarker plan and lends rationale to the clinical study (NCT05054348) of IO-108 as a novel immunotherapy for multiple solid tumor types, including those relapsed\/refractory to standard of care therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c4f7109f-8398-49af-a829-5fe9c4f8769f\/@v03B8ZG3\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunotherapy,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16848"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jing-Tyan Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoye Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Stafford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krista McCutcheon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heyu Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyu Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyu Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>ChengCheng Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luke Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>An Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Woodard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>XCharlene Liao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>MariaJose Costa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

These data suggest that CD200R1 may be a pivotal checkpoint in immunosurveillance of cancer and a promising therapeutic target. CD200R1 is expressed widely on human T cells and myeloid cells; and binds to its cognate ligand CD200 to suppress the activity of immune cells. Elevated expression of CD200R1 was observed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes relative to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cancer patients. While the expression of CD200R1 and its ligand CD200 are well characterized, the downstream immunosuppressive role for CD200R1 in human tumors or the potentiation of anti-tumor T cell function by targeting of CD200R1 is not well understood. To test the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the CD200R1 pathway we developed 23ME&#8209;00610, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to all functionally relevant isoforms and haplotypes of CD200R1 with high affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub> values &#60; 0.1 nM), to target tumors that are reliant on the CD200R1 immunosuppressive pathway. 23ME-00610 completely displaced the ligand CD200 from CD200R1 in cell-based flow cytometry assays with blocking IC<sub>50<\/sub> values that ranged from 0.32 to 1.04 nM depending on the concentration of CD200 ligand present, and inhibited downstream signaling through the adaptor protein DOK2 in a reporter-based assay. Functionally, 23ME-00610 reversed CD200-mediated suppression of chronically stimulated primary T cells. In addition, 23ME-00610 enhanced PBMC-mediated tumor killing with a mean EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 2.09 nM using methods of real-time measurement of cytotoxicity of human CD200-expressing tumor cells when compared to control antibodies. Moreover, 23ME-00610 promoted IFN&#947; production, a key functional anti-tumor T cell cytokine, in cancer patients&#8217;-derived PBMCs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that 23ME-00610 has the potential to reverse CD200-mediated immunosuppression in the TME to enhance anti-tumor T-cell functions in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2f2bb1c7-d472-4278-98ce-7925ac244ca9\/@v03B8ZG3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Cancer immunotherapy,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16849"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jill Fenaux<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yao-ming Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina Melero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei-Jen Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suk Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dina Ayupova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mauro Poggio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dylan Glatt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zuoan Yi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cecilia Lay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maike Schmidt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia R.

We identified hundreds of shared GWAS signals across phenotypes that appear to be driven by pleiotropic causal variants whose direction of effect (risk versus protection) systematically differs across cancer and autoimmune diseases including a signal linked to a clinically validated immune checkpoint receptor. This observation suggests that genes linked to such signals may be utilized by tumor cells to evade the immune system. We hypothesize that such signals indicate nodes of critical importance for anti-tumor immune response. By utilizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to link these signals to causal effects on genes, we identified CD200R1, an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells and myeloid cells, as an immune checkpoint target. Immune-oncology associations were observed in multiple components of the CD200R1 pathway, including the receptor, its cognate ligand, CD200, and its downstream adaptor protein, DOK2. Expression of CD200R1 was validated in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq from various tumor types. This genetics-driven target discovery platform facilitated the development of a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds CD200R1 on immune cells with high affinity and enhances killing of tumor cells expressing CD200.<br \/>[X.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) designed to block immune inhibitory receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4 have been approved and show unprecedented efficacy in cancer treatment. This led to rapid expansion of drug development to many more IC receptors including members of the T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) - CD112R (PVRIG) - CD226 Axis. TIGIT binds to its ligands CD155 (PVR) and CD112 (PVRL2) while CD112R binds to CD112. Binding of TIGIT or CD112R to CD155\/CD112 inhibits the co-stimulatory activity of the paired receptor CD226. Thus, therapeutic targeting of this axis can modulate T cell and NK cell activation and unleash anti-cancer immunity. One of the bottlenecks of immunotherapy drug development is the lack of quantitative and reproducible functional assays for mAb potency determination. Existing methods rely heavily on primary immune cells which is labor intensive and highly variable. To address this need, we developed a panel of cell-based reporter bioassays that can quantitatively measure the potencies of mAbs targeting TIGIT\/CD155, TIGIT\/CD112, and CD112R\/CD112. Owing to positive clinical trial results of TIGIT blockade in combination with PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade, we further developed a potency bioassay for bispecific antibodies simultaneously targeting TIGIT and PD-1\/PD-L1. These bioassays each consist of an engineered T effector cell line that expresses T cell receptors and IC receptors of interest, and an engineered artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) expressing the corresponding ligands for the IC receptors. The T effector cell lines also express a luciferase reporter driven by a promoter specifically responding to TCR activation which can be inhibited by signaling from the IC receptors. Additionally, we developed bioassays that can measure potencies of agonist or antagonist mAbs targeting CD226. These bioassays are designed to reflect the mechanisms of action for the drug candidates designed for each IC receptor and the assay signals are specific. Most are prequalified according to ICH guidelines and show the precision, accuracy and linearity required for relative potency determination and product stability study under cGMP environments. Therefore, these MoA-based bioassays can serve as valuable tools for early drug discovery, potency determination and stability studies throughout the development of mAbs targeting the TIGIT\/CD112R\/CD226 axis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4c3e4e21-790d-489f-92ca-87448bafd088\/@v03B8ZG3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,PVRIG,Bioassay,CD226,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16852"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jamison Grailer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Garvin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Hartnett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mei Cong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhi-Jie Jey Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2 is a central regulator of inflammation, and genetic deletion of PTPN2 on either tumor cells or host immune cells promotes anti-tumor immunity. However, inhibitors of PTPN2 have not been described. Here, we present the validation of ABBV-CLS-484, a potent catalytic inhibitor of PTPN2 and the closely related phosphatase PTPN1. ABBV-CLS-484 treatment of tumor cells in vitro phenocopies the genetic deletion of PTPN2\/N1, causing both amplified transcriptional responses to IFNg and reduced cell viability across human cancer cell lines. Monotherapy ABBV-CLS-484 treatment generates robust anti-tumor immunity in several murine cancer models with efficacy comparable to anti-PD-1 treatment. Through genetic studies, we show that while ABBV-CLS-484 can act on both tumor cells and the host immune system, IFN sensing and PTPN2\/N1 expression on tumor cells are not always required for efficacy, suggesting that PTPN2\/N1 inhibition on host immune cells may be sufficient for activity of the drug. Through scRNAseq profiling of TILs from both ABBV-CLS-484-treated and anti-PD-1-treated tumors, we show that ABBV-CLS-484 induces unique transcriptional changes to both myeloid and lymphoid populations in the tumor microenvironment which are dominated by enhanced IFN sensing and a shift from suppressive to pro-inflammatory phenotypes. ABBV-CLS-484 treatment enhances the activation and effector functions of CD8+ T cells while decreasing the expression of genes classically associated with T cell exhaustion and dysfunction such as Tox. The efficacy of ABBV-CLS-484 is critically dependent on CD8+ T cells and treatment with ABBV-CLS-484 results in greater levels of T cell infiltration into tumors and a more diverse repertoire of expanded T cell clones relative to anti-PD-1. Thus, the PTPN2\/N1 inhibitor ABBV-CLS-484 is a highly effective immunotherapy with monotherapy efficacy across mouse tumor models. Small molecule inhibitors of PTPN2 offer a promising new strategy for cancer immunotherapy by targeting an IFN signaling checkpoint and are currently being evaluated clinically in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT04777994).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/147b351e-8e82-4333-9f43-902af47a07dc\/@v03B8ZG3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Small molecule inhibitor,Interferons,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16856"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Arvin Iracheta-Vellve<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hakimeh Ebrahimi-Nik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas R.

CD47 interacts with inhibitory receptor signaling protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) to mediate a series of activities such as apoptosis, proliferation, and immune response. Tumor cells can escape the immune surveillance of macrophages through the CD47-SIRPa signaling pathway. Blocking CD47-SIRP&#945; interactions has been shown to promote the destruction of cancer cells by phagocytes. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that targeting of the CD47-SIRP&#945; axis may also promote antigen-presenting cell function . These identify the CD47-SIRP&#945; axis as a promising innate immune checkpoint in cancer. We have generated humanized SIRP&#945; and double humanized CD47\/SIRP&#945; mice model for drug efficacy and toxicity evaluation. The humanized mice with human extracellular domain and mouse cytoplasmic fragment of target protein showed similar immune cell population compared with wild type mice. The anti-CD47 antibody, Magrolimab (5F9) analog, displayed anti-tumor effect when administrated to humanized SIRP&#945; mice bearing MC38-hCD47 (MC38 cells engineered to express human CD47) tumor cells. The tumor regression was also observed when treating humanized CD47\/SIRP&#945; mice bearing MC38-hCD47 with tested anti-CD47 antibody. Dual checkpoint blockade of CD47 and PD-L1 or PD1 have been reported as a synergistic therapy that activates both innate and adaptive immune response against tumors.We also generated humanized PD1\/SIRP&#945; and PD1\/PDL1\/SIRP&#945;\/CD47 mice model for efficacy and toxicity evaluation of drugs targeting for CD47\/SIRP&#945;-PD1\/PD-L1 axes. Treatment with anti-CD47, anti-SIRP&#945; and anti-PD-L1 alone showed tumor regression efficacy, and combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-SIRP&#945; or anti-CD47 showed improved anti-tumor effect compared with alone treatment. Those data suggested the humanized syngeneic mice model are useful for the efficacy evaluation of drugs targeting of <b> <\/b> axes.However, the administration of anti-CD47 blocking antibodies may cause haematotoxicity, including anaaemia and thrombocytopenia, because of the ubiquitous expression of CD47.In vitro Erythrocyte binding activity analysis showed that red blood cells(RBC) collected from humanized CD47\/SIRP&#945; mice could bind with Magrolimab analog, while another anti-CD47 antibody has low affinity with RBC. Furthermore, treatment with Magrolimab analog in CD47\/SIRP&#945; humanized mice caused haemagglutination and Hemolysis of human RBCs , which were not observed when treating with tested anti-CD47 antibody. Thus, the humanized CD47 and double humanized CD47\/SIRP&#945; mice are also suitable for CD47 antibody toxicity evaluation. In conclusion, humanized CD47\/SIRP&#945; and quadruple humanized PD1\/PDL1\/SIRP&#945;\/CD47 mice model provide a validated preclinical mouse model to interrogate new therapeutic agents targeting SIRP&#945;-PD1 axes in immune oncology therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/85c0a3a4-102b-4b69-aa5d-2e085f66974f\/@w03B8ZG4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,SIRP&#945;,PD1,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16857"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Juan Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunxiang Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Song Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiwei Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santi Suryani Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mark Moore<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, monotherapies have not shown meaningful clinical responses in solid tumors. Therefore, therapeutic combinations are being explored to improve patient outcomes. CD47 is a macrophage checkpoint inhibitor that acts as a &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal on cancer cells to evade innate immune detection and destruction. Targeted radiation to cancer cells will upregulate calreticulin (CRT), a pro-phagocytic &#8220;eat me&#8221; signal. We therefore hypothesize that we can enhance the efficacy of anti-CD47 antibodies by combining them with appropriate targeted antibody radioconjugates (ARC). In this experiment we chose to study an anti-HER3 radioconjugate, as HER3 is overexpressed in a variety of cancers including breast, ovarian, lung, gastric and prostate and is associated with poor clinical prognosis. Additionally, upregulation of HER3 is implicated in the acquired resistance against HER1 or HER2 targeted therapies. Here, we demonstrate enhanced therapeutic efficacy of a novel Actinium-225 (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac) armed HER3 specific targeting ARC (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC) and a CD47 blocking antibody (anti-CD47) combination in preclinical solid tumor models.<br \/>Methods: The anti-HER3 antibody (AT-02) was radiolabeled with <sup>225<\/sup>Ac. <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC biological activity was evaluated using human recombinant HER3 and receptor positive tumor cell lines. <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC mediated CRT upregulation and cytotoxicity was evaluated using flow cytometry and MTS assay, respectively. The benefits of the <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC and anti-CD47 combination to enhance macrophage phagocytosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. We further evaluated the therapeutic benefits of the <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC and CD47 combination in human HER3<sup>+<\/sup> tumor xenograft mouse model.<br \/>Results: The <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC retains similar binding properties to native antibody and demonstrates specific cytotoxicity on tumor cells. CRT was upregulated by <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC in HER3<sup>+<\/sup> cells. Furthermore, the combination of <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC and anti-CD47 enhances in vitro macrophage mediated tumor cell phagocytosis compared to each agent alone. Importantly, the in vivo <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC and CD47 antibody combination shows enhanced antitumor effect with reduced toxicity and improved survival benefit in a human preclinical solid tumor model compared to anti-CD47 agent alone.<br \/>Conclusions: We demonstrate enhanced efficacy of the <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC and CD47 blocking antibody combination in vitro and in a preclinical solid tumor animal model. This approach is an encouraging strategy to potentially improve antitumor responses in patients with HER3<sup>+<\/sup> tumors. Consequently, the findings obtained in this study along with the need to develop better therapies for patients with HER3<sup>+<\/sup> tumors support the further preclinical development of HER3-ARC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/22a3573c-76b4-418b-b9e7-1760724ead6e\/@w03B8ZG4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Combination therapy,Radioimmunotherapy,Targeted alpha therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16859"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Denis Beckford-Vera<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Jennings<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan McCloskey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Chin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qing Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monideepa Roy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helen Kotanides<\/i><\/presenter>.

Blockade of the immune checkpoint TIGIT was shown to enhance anti-tumor immunity in MM pre-clinical models. In addition to TIGIT, the DNAM1 axis includes the novel inhibitory receptor PVRIG. Both TIGIT and PVRIG deliver inhibitory signals to T and NK cells and compete with the co-activating receptor DNAM1 for binding to PVR and PVRL2, respectively. Accordingly, TIGIT and PVRIG co-blockade was shown to synergize in enhancing anti-tumor immunity in preclinical models. PVRL2 and PVR were shown to be expressed on MM plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). In this study, we evaluated DNAM1 axis receptor expression in the BM of patients with MM. BM mononuclear cells derived from 21 patients with MM were analyzed for the expression of PD1 and DNAM1 axis molecules by flow cytometry. Patients classified with progressed disease (PD), or complete response (CR) were treated with multiple lines of therapies including targeted therapies, chemotherapies, proteasome inhibitors. PVRIG demonstrated the highest expression among all evaluated receptors on NK (88%), NKT (81%) and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (79%), significantly higher than PD1 (p&#60;0.0001) and TIGIT (P&#60;0.001). TIGIT showed substantially increased expression on NK (64%, P&#60;0.0001) and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (58%, p&#60;0.05) compared to PD1 (expressed on 12% of NK cells and 42% of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells). Importantly, 50% and 60% of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and NK cells, respectively, co-expressed TIGIT and PVRIG, and all examined cell populations showed increased levels of DNAM1 (&#62;50%). Additionally, the expression of PVRIG ligand, PVRL2, on BM plasma cells from 6 patients with MM was demonstrated by immuno-histochemistry and flow cytometry. A fraction of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were DNAM1<sup>-<\/sup> and positive for PVRIG\/TIGIT\/PD1<sup> <\/sup>(22%), suggesting the accumulation of an exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell population in the MM tumor microenvironment. PVRIG showed significantly higher (p&#60;0.0001) expression on DNAM<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (81%), compared to TIGIT (43%) and PD1 (34%), supporting the potential of PVRIG blockade to enhance DNAM1 signaling and subsequent CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activation. Finally, patients with CR had a trend towards higher DNAM1 expression on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (75%) compared to PD patients (54%, p=0.057). To conclude, DNAM1 axis receptors are dominantly expressed on MM BM lymphocytes, with PVRIG exhibiting the most prominent expression. The reduced expression of DNAM1 in patients with PD suggests a link between DNAM1 axis and clinical outcome. Our findings highlight for the first time the dominant expression of PVRIG, as well as TIGIT and suggest that combined blockade of these checkpoints may potentially benefit patients with MM, placing the DNAM1 axis as a promising therapeutic pathway in MM therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/acd8af7a-5a9d-485d-a781-18d80bbaed3c\/@w03B8ZG4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Multiple myeloma,TIGIT,Combination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16860"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Masha Frenkel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoya Alteber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ning Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingjie Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiming Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gady Cojocaru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Berenson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eran Ophir<\/i><\/presenter>.

Tissue biopsies often collected once in the metastatic setting through an invasive procedure, or archived primary tumor tissue often collected much prior to treatment consideration, are the specimen types of choice for biomarker identification. The tissue sample originates from a limited region of one disease site, which may limit its usefulness given intra-patient tumor heterogeneity. TMB and MSI measurement by liquid biopsy, including proteins, circulating tumor cells (CTC), and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), is an attractive, minimally-invasive way to obtain a real-time picture of the entire disease. While TMB and MSI assessment from ctDNA have been reported, their measurement can be limited by low ctDNA tumor fraction. Single-cell next generation sequencing of CTC, on the other hand, is a particularly well-suited, but largely unexplored method of measuring TMB and MSI to complement tissue and ctDNA for better overall specificity of detection. In this proof-of-concept study, we show the ability to detect single-cell TMB and MSI. We analyzed 14 CTC and 4 ctDNA samples from 6 metastatic breast cancer patients, as well as 3 single cells and 1 cell pellet sample each from HCT-116 (MSI-High) and WiDr (MSI-Low) cell lines. CTC and cell line cells were enriched with the CellSearch&#174; system and\/or isolated with the DEPArray&#8482; system. Whole genome amplified single-cell DNA was sequenced with the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay covering ~500 genes and 1.1Mb of genomic space. TMB and MSI scores obtained in CTC and ctDNA were compared to those measured in matched clinical tissue biopsies. Single-cell TMB scores and MSI status were assessable in all CTC tested. CTC TMB scores were highly concordant with the matched tissue samples (r=1.00), as were ctDNA TMB scores (r=0.98) in patients with assessable TMB scores in both biospecimen types compared. Importantly, TMB was detectable in CTC from one patient whose tissue sample was inadequate for clinical sequencing, and from another patient with inadequate, low tumor fraction ctDNA. Intriguingly, one patient harbored 3 TMB-high and 2 TMB-low CTC, potentially indicating intra-patient TMB heterogeneity. The known MSI-low status from clinical tumor tissue sequencing was correctly detected in CTC and ctDNA from all patients. MSI status and scores from single cells of HCT-116 and WiDr cell lines purified with the DEPArray&#8482; system (mimicking CTC isolation), perfectly matched that of the corresponding cell pellet samples (r=1.00). Taken together, these data suggest the potential validity and continued interrogation of potential utility of CTC TMB and MSI detection to complement tissue and ctDNA in guiding checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0392c14-6e86-4c00-83a2-9922baf8b717\/@w03B8ZG4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Tumor mutational burden,Microsatellite instability,Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16861"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andi K.

The basal-like (BL) subtype accounts for 10-15% of all BCs and is a particularly aggressive disease due to its extreme intrinsic diversity compared with other subtypes. Paradoxically, obesity promotes immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) response in some cancers. Further, obesity promotes altered intestinal microbial composition, and recent clinical studies of fecal microbiota transplants suggest causal links between the microbiome and immunotherapy responses. Hence, we evaluated the correlation of tumoral and cecal microbiota with anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD1) immunotherapy response in a murine model of BLBC and obesity.<br \/>Methods: In an initial study, normoweight female C57BL\/6J mice (n=8\/group) received orthotopic injection of one of two novel C3TAg BLBC cell lines (1.02 and 2.51) syngeneic to C57BL\/6J derived from a spontaneous tumor excised from B6-C3TAg transgenic mice. Gene expression profiling (Affymetrix arrays) with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed on the resulting transplanted tumors. In a second study, female C57BL\/6J mice were divided into a diet-induced obesity (DIO) group (n=30), promoted by high-fat diet feeding, and a lean control group (n=30). After 24 weeks, 2.51 cells were orthotopically injected into the fourth mammary fat pad of all mice, followed by treatment with anti-PD1 or IgG control antibodies (n=15\/diet group). Tumor and cecal DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.<br \/>Results: GSEA from the initial study revealed that orthotopically transplanted line 2.51 tumors, relative to line 1.02 tumors, had lower levels of stromal remodeling as indicated by significant enrichment of gene sets related to extracellular matrix proteoglycans, collagen chain trimerization, and collagen biosynthesis and modification. Gene sets related to insulin and IGF-1 signaling were also lower in line 2.51 tumors than line 1.02 tumors. The in-life portion of the second study revealed a heterogeneous response to ICI therapies among lean and obese mice. To understand this diversity of response, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of tumoral and cecal microbiota in response to DIO and ICI therapy is underway.<br \/>Discussion: These data reveal striking differences in tumor microenvironment and nutrient sensing as being potentially important determinants of differential tumor growth in BLBC. Ultimately, this research may contribute to the development of precision nutrition approaches using pro-\/pre-biotics to promote microbial communities, targeting the tumor microenvironment, which may improve immunotherapy response and disrupt the obesity-associated exacerbation of breast cancer.<br \/>Financial Support: This work was supported by R35CA197627 to SDH.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1fa1de6c-e112-43e0-bf6b-051337d59c0a\/@w03B8ZG4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunotherapy,Obesity,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16863"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tori L.

A multitude of inhibitory Siglecs on myeloid cells become engaged in sialic acid-rich tumor microenvironments, suggesting that disrupting Siglec-sialic acid signaling could confer therapeutic benefit in cancer. To accomplish this, we designed AL009, an engineered Siglec-9 extracellular domain-Fc fusion molecule that acts as a sialic acid trap and a multi-Siglec inhibitor, repolarizing suppressive myeloid cells and activating an anti-cancer response.<br \/>Methods - Cooperative binding of AL009 was analyzed by flow cytometry using cultured human tumor cell lines and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) differentiated from primary human monocytes. Monocytes, MDSCs, and macrophages differentiated from primary human monocytes were assessed for AL009 binding by flow cytometry. AL009m (AL009 with a mouse Fc) was fluorophore-labeled and intravenously injected into B6 mice to analyze biodistribution via ex vivo tissue imaging over time. Initial toxicology screening was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys in a non-terminal study.<br \/>Results - AL009 displays cooperative binding with sialic acid and Fc gamma receptors on myeloid cells. When comparing binding among myeloid cell subsets, AL009 preferentially binds MDSCs. Analysis of the biodistribution of labeled AL009m in mice showed the greatest accumulation in the spleen, consistent with immune cell targeting in vivo. Further, Fc engineering of AL009 improved the pharmacodynamic profile compared to a non-engineered Fc. In cynomolgus monkeys, single doses of 80 mg\/kg appeared safe and without clinically significant findings.<br \/>Conclusions - The engineered structure of AL009 leads to preferential binding to an immunosuppressive subset of myeloid cells. This targeting leads to repolarization of myeloid cells and activates an innate and adaptive anti-cancer response. Pharmacologically relevant doses of AL009 appear well-tolerated in initial studies in non-human primates, supporting further development for entry into clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea7cad82-aeea-4bd7-91dd-48b8f9703131\/@w03B8ZG4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Checkpoint Inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16864"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sam Nalle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helen Lam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheryl Barner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Long<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Spencer Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arnon Rosenthal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Maslyar<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite the success of the checkpoint blockade strategies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1), many cancer patients cannot benefit from these therapies. T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) has emerged as one of the next generation ICI targets, with potentially lower toxicity and higher safety compared to CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockades. TIM-3 is widely expressed in different immune lineages playing various roles such as mediating immune tolerance and regulating innate immune response. However, the mechanism of action of TIM-3 inhibition in different malignancies is not completely understood. Whether the expression and genomic status of TIM-3 and its ligands, Ceacam-1, galectin-9, HMGB1 and phosphatidyl serine (PtdSer) are associated with clinical outcome or any indication would be essential for patient selection for TIM-3 targeting therapies.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> Human PD-1\/TIM-3 double-knock-in mice (PD-1\/TIM-3 dKI HuGEMM&#8482;) engrafted with CT26.WT tumor model were used to test human PD-1 antibody (Keytruda) and TIM-3 antibody (MBG453). Immune phenotyping of blood, tumor draining lymph node (TDLN) and spleen tissues were assessed by flow cytometry at different time points after dosing. Cytokine levels in serum were measured by MSD assays at 48 hours post the 3rd dose and at study termination. Patient genomic and clinical data for various cancer types such as colorectal adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma were collected for prognostic biomarker analysis.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> In the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy study of single and combination treatment with Keytruda and MBG453, we observed that NK cells were induced by anti-TIM-3 treatment, alone and in combination, in both blood and TDLN. This indicates TIM-3 blockade may lead to NK cell proliferation in the TME to enhance tumor killing. Transcriptomic analysis on thousands of patients from TCGA showed that high expression of TIM-3 was highly associated with MSI-H and MSI\/CIMP subtypes of colorectal adenocarcinoma, suggesting the potential of Tim-3 target therapy in combination with PD-1 blockade in colorectal cancers. By survival analysis, we observe that one of the TIM-3 ligands, HMGB1, expression is associated with patient OS and PFS with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but not in colorectal cancers. Furthermore, TIM-3 expression was associated with many immune cell signatures, including macrophages, dendritic cells, CD8+ memory T cells, CD4+ memory T cells and Tregs in both colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> Evaluation in preclinical model demonstrated that TIM-3 blockade may cause NK cell proliferation to enhance anti-tumor immunity.

However, the overall success rate of immunotherapeutic drugs remains low, due to poor efficacy (cancer immunotherapeutic effect [CITE]) or unexpected safety risks such as immune-related adverse events (irAEs), underlining the importance of predictive preclinical animal models. Notably, most immunotherapies cannot be modeled in xenograft tumor models, due to their immunodeficient phenotype, or syngeneic models, as most biologics are usually species-specific. Given these limitations, genetically engineered humanized mouse models (HuGEMM<sup>TM<\/sup>) and syngeneic cell lines (HuCELL<sup>TM<\/sup>), where human drug target gene(s) replace the original mouse ortholog(s), have been broadly used to assess species-restricted biologics for CITE. Since most irAEs in biologics are on-target toxicities, it is potentially possible to model the irAEs of biologics using non-tumor bearing HuGEMMs. In this study, the PD-1\/CTLA-4 double knock-in (dKI) HuGEMM is used as an example to provide more insights into irAE evaluation in preclinical models.<br \/>Methods: The PD-1 and CTLA-4 HuGEMM in BALB\/c backgrounds were developed by substituting the mouse extracellular domains with their human counterparts, followed by crossbreeding to create dKI mice for both targets. The juvenile dKI mice (age 4-5 weeks) were treated with the vehicle control, anti-human PD-1, and a combination therapy of anti-human PD-1\/anti-human CTLA-4. The models were monitored for toxicity parameters, including general welfare, body weight, mortality, gross pathology (arthritis, skin inflammation, and colitis scoring), and histopathology of different organs at study termination.<br \/>Results: No body weight loss was observed throughout the study in all treatment groups. No mortality was observed in models treated with a monotherapy, while in the combination group (anti-human PD-1\/anti-human CTLA-4), five mice displayed lethargy and tachypnea symptoms, and four mice experienced severe adverse effects. Per gross pathology analysis, combination treatment caused significant arthritis in the feet of the mice at study end. Histopathology analysis of the combination treatment group samples demonstrated colon epithelia damage and heart lymphocyte infiltration at termination. These observations for toxicity or irAE profiles are in line with those observed in patients undergoing the same treatment regimen.<br \/>Conclusions: HuGEMM engineered to express human targets could be used in preclinical studies to test for assessing irAE of biologics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9282302d-2de7-4ece-b27a-ee4d11459483\/@x03B8ZG5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Toxicity,Mouse models,irAE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19392"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel XF He<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

It is expressed on activated T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and inhibits their activation. Blocking LAG-3 activity is expected to provide therapeutic benefits in the treatment of cancer, especially when combined with PD-1 blockade. Due to the low homology between human and mouse LAG-3 and PD-1 and in order to enable increased translatability of preclinical in-vivo efficacy evaluation of immune checkpoint antibodies, we generated double humanized mice by replacing the extracellular domain of mouse LAG-3 and PD-1 with the corresponding human sequences.<br \/>Homozygous double humanized mice express chimeric LAG-3 and PD-1 at comparable levels to mouse LAG-3 and PD-1 respectively in wildtype mice. When treated with human LAG-3 antibody (anti-LAG-3) or human PD-1 antibody (anti-PD-1), CT26 tumor growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, proving that both humanized proteins are functional. However, not all tumor types respond to anti-LAG-3 or anti-PD-1 the same. To identify the suitable tumor models for preclinical efficacy evaluation of anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 combo therapy, we engrafted several syngeneic tumor models onto our mice. The growth of subcutaneously engrafted MC38 colon tumor was mildly inhibited by anti-PD-1, but strongly inhibited in the presence of anti-LAG-3. Similarly, B16F10 melanoma tumor showed modest growth inhibition when treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-LAG-3 separately, while combination therapy significantly repressed tumor growth. However, neither monotherapies of anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 nor combination treatment effectively inhibited tumorigenesis of LLC1 derived lung cancer, indicating that this tumor is likely insensitive to PD-1 and LAG-3 blockade. Collectively, these data indicate that double humanized PD-1 and LAG-3 mice are a powerful tool to evaluate the therapeutic efficacies of anti-hPD-1 and anti-hLAG-3 treatment in different types of tumor in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f549cec0-a765-4f01-8d9c-3d540d7c5f8a\/@x03B8ZG5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,LAG3,PD1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21405"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Feifei Duan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoliu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunxiang Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Santi Suryani Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In T cells, Cbl-b negatively regulates adaptive immune system signaling by establishing the threshold for the activation of antigen receptors. Additionally, Cbl-b regulates the function of other immune cell types, including NK cells, dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes. Cbl-b deficient T cells no longer require a costimulatory signal to be fully activated. Cbl-b KO mice spontaneously reject tumors via an enhanced immune response. Taken together, these findings point to Cbl-b inhibitors as having the potential to be highly efficacious immuno-oncology agents.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: A structure-based drug design approach was used to identify potent inhibitors of Cbl-b. Biochemical and cellular binding assays, a cellular NFAT-luciferase reporter assay, as well as primary <i>in vitro<\/i> human and mouse T cell activation assays measuring IL-2 production were used to profile inhibitor compounds. <i>In vivo<\/i> activity of Cb-b inhibitors was evaluated using an anti-CD3 mouse model and a CT-26 syngeneic mouse model<br \/>Results: Cbl-b inhibitor NTX-001 potently binds to Cbl-b, preventing Cbl-b phosphorylation and binding to E2. In cells, NTX-001 treatment results in enhanced phosphorylation of ZAP-70, a protein proximal to the TCR and reported to be a direct substrate of Cbl-b. Additionally, inhibition of Cbl-b potently enhances cytokine secretion from primary human and mouse T cells. <i>In vivo<\/i>, an increase in cytokines and T cell activation markers was observed after a single dose of NTX-001. Repeated dosing of NTX-001 showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in the colorectal CT-26 syngeneic model.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>NTX-001 is a potent Cbl-b inhibitor that demonstrated strong T cell activation and anti-tumor activity in a syngeneic tumor model.
