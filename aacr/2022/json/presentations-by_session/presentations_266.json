The gene <i>HSD3B1<\/i> encodes the steroid metabolism enzyme 3&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1, which catalyzes a critical step in conversion of adrenal precursor steroids to potent androgens and estrogens. Associations between the missense-encoding germline variant rs1047303 in <i>HSD3B1 <\/i>have been described to affect outcomes of castration-resistant prostate cancer and associated with ER positivity in postmenopausal breast cancer. The adrenal-permissive 1245C allele enables greater production of androgens and estrogens from adrenal precursors, whereas the adrenal-restrictive 1245A allele limits this reaction pathway. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas&#8217;s TCGA-UCEC and TCGA-BRCA projects, we interrogated whether the adrenal-restrictive rs1047303 genotype was associated with less hormone-driven genomic clusters of endometrial and breast cancer. We determined the genotype frequencies for different tumor subtypes, as classified by the genomic analysis of Sanchez-Vega, et al. (2018). The adrenal-restrictive <i>HSD3B1<\/i>(1245A) allele was associated with the copy number (CN) high cluster of endometrial cancer (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.12-2.26, p = 0.0098), notably composed of serous and high-grade endometrioid endometrial cancers which are less estrogen-dependent than low-grade endometrioid tumors. Similarly, the adrenal-restrictive <i>HSD3B1<\/i>(1245A) was associated with the basal subtype of breast cancer (OR 1.54 [1.13-2.09], p = 0.0057), a subtype that is largely ER-negative and is known to share genomic features with serous-type endometrial cancers. Lastly, we interrogated overall survival of endometrial cancer patients in the UK Biobank and found that patients homozygous for the adrenal-restrictive <i>HSD3B1<\/i>(1245A) had worse overall survival (HR 1.39 [1.16-1.68], p = 0.00049) and cancer-specific survival (HR 1.39 [1.14-1.70], p = 0.0013), a finding consistent with the A allele being enriched in the more aggressive CN-high subtype of endometrial cancer. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for adrenal-restrictive vs. adrenal-permissive steroidogenesis, by way of rs1047303 genotype, in the development of and\/or outcomes from at least three different commonly hormone-associated types of cancer: prostate, breast, and endometrial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-01 Endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen metabolism,Endometrial cancer,Breast cancer,Androgen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeffrey M.

Oncogenic ER coregulators overexpressed in BC can contribute to constitutive, ligand-independent and ligand-dependent signaling which drives growth, resistance to therapy and metastasis. Proline-, glutamic acid, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), is a known coregulator that plays a critical role in ER oncogenic functions. Its expression is deregulated in BC and is a prognostic indicator of poor BC survival. The lack of a small molecule inhibitor that directly targets PELP1 represents a major knowledge gap. Therefore, we conducted a large scale peptide library screening and identified novel <u>P<\/u>eptide <u>I<\/u>nhibitor of <u>P<\/u>ELP1 (PIP1). We demonstrated that PIP1 directly interacts with PELP1, promotes its degradation and has the potential to block PELP1 oncogenic functions <i>in vitro<\/i>. Using innovative peptidomimetic technology, we modeled PIP1 and synthesized several derivatives as <u>S<\/u>mall <u>M<\/u>olecule <u>I<\/u>nhibitors of <u>P<\/u>ELP1 (SMIPs). Using MTT assay and multiple BC cell lines, we identified a lead compound, SMIP34 with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 5-10&#181;M and with minimal effect on human mammary epithelial cells. SMIP34 <i>in vitro <\/i>activity was assessed by colony formation and Matrigel invasion assays. Knockdown of PELP1 using shRNA in BC cells significantly reduced SMIP34 activity, indicating target specificity. Further, MST and biotin-SMIP34 pulldown confirmed direct binding of SMIP34 to PELP1. Using ER+WT, mtER (mutant ER), and TR-BC cell lines we demonstrated that SMIP34 exhibits antiproliferative effects and reduces invasiveness. Mechanistic studies using Western blot analysis confirmed that SMIP34 binding to PELP1 contributes to its degradation via the proteasome pathway. Thus MG132 treatment attenuated SMIP34 mediated degradation. RTqPCR analyses confirmed SMIP34 treatment reduced expression of PELP1 target genes. RNAseq analyses showed SMIP34 treatment altered the expression of genes associated with Estrogen response, Cell cycle and Apoptosis pathways. Cell cycle analyses revealed SMIP34 treatment promoted S phase arrest of BC cell lines. Using ER+WT, mtER, and PDX tumor tissues <i>ex vivo<\/i>, we demonstrated that SMIP34 significantly decreased tumor proliferation as measured by Ki67 staining. Further, SMIP34 (20mg\/kg\/IP) treatment <i>in vivo<\/i> significantly reduced tumor progression in mouse models of ER+WT, mtER, and mtER patient-derived xenograft BC. Our results using <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>ex vivo<\/i>, and <i>in vivo<\/i> models showcase SMIP34 as a first-in-class inhibitor of oncogenic PELP1 signaling and may serve as a potential therapeutic molecule for treating ER+, mtER, and TR-BC.

ONA is currently being evaluated in metastatic breast cancers (MBC), as well as other hormone-dependent cancers. Recently, therapeutic options for metastatic estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancers have been expanded by the introduction of cyclin-dependent kinase 4\/6 inhibitors (CDK4\/6i), administered in combination with endocrine treatments, as first line therapy. Moreover, the selective PI3K inhibitor alpelisib (ALP) has been approved for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutated endocrine resistant MBC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ONA in combination with fulvestrant (FUL) and palbociclib (PAL) or ALP in different PDX models established from ER and PR positive breast cancers.<br \/><u>Methods:<\/u> PDX models were established from primary tumors or biopsies from bone metastases from endocrine therapy patients with progressing tumors. ER and PR expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot (WB) analysis in 17 PDX models. The anti-tumor activity of onapristone alone or combined with FUL and PAL was tested in 2 ER+\/PR+ PDX studies, while the combination with ALP+FUL was tested in one PIK3CA-mutated PDX study. Phosphorylation of both PR and ER-PR interactions were analyzed in treated tumors by WB and by the <i>in situ<\/i> Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA), respectively.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> PR expression was found in 1\/9 PDX established from primary breast tumors and 4\/8 PDX established from bone metastases. ONA <i>in vivo<\/i> activity was tested in 2 PDX of bone metastases: PDX BC1101 (PR low) and BC1117 (PR high). BC1101 showed amplification of <i>FGFR1<\/i> and <i>CCND1<\/i> genes, while BC1117 has an activating mutation of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> gene. In the low PR PDX BC1101, treatment with ONA was ineffective in both the monotherapy and combination setting. Conversely, in the PDX with high expression of PR, BC1117, ONA treatment, given as monotherapy, decreased tumor growth. The anti-tumor activity of ONA+FUL+PAL combination was significantly increased as compared to FUL+PAL, with the majority of xenografts showing tumor regression. Expression of PR and phospho-PR were inhibited in the tumors treated by FUL, ONA+FUL, and ONA+FUL+PAL. Interaction between ER and PR, analyzed by the <i>in situ<\/i> PLA assay, was inhibited in the ONA+FUL treated xenografts &#177;PAL. Finally, treatment with the triple combination of ONA+FUL+ALP was also highly effective and significantly greater than the combination of FUL+ALP. RNAseq analysis of treated xenografts is ongoing to identify transcriptomic changes in the different treatment arms. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that ONA improved the response to endocrine treatment using CDK4\/6 or PI3K inhibitors in a MBC-derived PDX model with high PR expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-04 Hormone signaling and inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,CDK4\/6,Progesterone receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Martin Lehr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed Dahmani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Léa Huguet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rania El-Botty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlène Thiebaut<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Muriel Romancer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Cottu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Elisabetta Marangoni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Tamoxifen (TAM), a SERM and AIs are the most commonly used adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with early-stage estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Despite the relative safety and significant anti-neoplastic and chemopreventive activities of tamoxifen and AIs, many initially responsive breast tumors develop resistance and ultimately recur. Many underlying molecular events that confer resistance are known, but a unifying theme is yet to be revealed. While the tumor microenvironment is being increasingly recognized as a key factor in multiple stages of disease progression, particularly local resistance, immune-escaping, and distant metastasis, our previous work shows that the critical molecular and cellular players secreted from a crosstalk between breast cancer cells and stromal cells can regulate the tumor growth and process of metastasis in breast cancer. In this report, using established endocrine resistant breast cancer (ERBC) cells and ESR1 mutant cells (Y537S and D538G), we screened the secreted factors in crosstalk between cancer cells and fibroblasts using cytokine antibody arrays and found that CXCL1 is highly upregulated in fibroblasts. To investigate a potential impact given the current clinical landscape of endocrine resistant breast cancer, we performed a high throughput cell-based screen to identify effective combinations of drugs that will be tested in vivo using reparixin, CXCR1\/2 inhibitor, tamoxifen (SERM), fulvestrant (SERD), and CDK4\/6 inhibitors (Palbociclib and Ribociclib) in co-culture with ERBC cells and fibroblast. Significantly, reparixin decreased ERBC cell viability compared to vehicle while reparixin in combination with tamoxifen and fulvestrant, enhanced the inhibitor effects in ERBC cell growth. We found that the combination treatment of reparixin and Palbociclib and ribociclib significantly inhibited ERBC cell growth and migration compared the single treatment. The inhibitory effect of reparixin was higher in combination with CDK4\/6 inhibitors that the combination with tamoxifen and fulvestrant. Furthermore, reparixin in combination with CDK4\/6 inhibitors decreased ERBC cell migration and promotes apoptosis.These findings implicate CXCL1 signaling as a critical event in ERBC tumor growth and metastasis via crosstalk between cancer cells and stromal components. Further, these studies suggest that CXCL1 act as key regulators orchestrating ERBC. Therefore, we have provided evidence that supports the hypothesis that functional inhibition of the CXCL1 and CDK4\/6 signaling pathway has the potential to circumvent ERBC growth and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-04 Hormone signaling and inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Endocrine resistance,CXCR2,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sneha Pandithar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Reff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kideok Jin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Unfortunately, treatment resistance often develops and combination therapies may represent potential strategies to prolong disease remission. The PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling pathway plays an essential role in prostate cancer and is upregulated in about 30-50% of patients. Loss of the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway inhibitor PTEN is observed in up to 40% of late-stage prostate cancer patients. Compounds inhibiting PI3K or Akt have shown promising efficacy in preclinical prostate cancer models, and advanced clinical trials with these inhibitors are currently ongoing in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, often in combination with AR inhibitors. Here we examined the impact of combining the AR inhibitor darolutamide with the pan class I PI3K inhibitor copanlisib on preclinical models <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We found that treating different androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines with darolutamide and copanlisib had a very strong synergistic inhibitory effect. Induction of apoptosis was observed in the PARP cleavage and caspase 3\/7 activation assays after treatment with copanlisib and more so after treatment with copanlisib plus darolutamide. Expression analysis showed that darolutamide strongly down-regulated AR target genes such as KLK3, FKBP5 and TMPRSS2, but copanlisib had no additional impact. However, when examining genes involved in the apoptotic pathway we found that the down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes that follows androgen treatment was strongly reversed by the combined darolutamide and copanlisib treatment. Finally, <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy studies showed that the LuCaP 96 prostate cancer patient-derived (PDX) xenograft, which has a non-functional PTEN gene, strongly responded to darolutamide, but additional treatment with copanlisib did not increase anti-tumor efficacy. In the LuCaP 35 PDX model, which expresses PTEN at low level, darolutamide or copanlisib treatment alone showed only limited efficacy, while the combination exhibited tumor inhibitory effects. In conclusion, we found that combining darolutamide with copanlisib strongly inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer models <i>in vitro<\/i>.

A large number of patients develop recurrence and die of advanced metastatic disease. More than 70% of metastatic breast cancers (mBC) express androgen receptor (AR) representing a potential target for anti-hormone therapies. AR is suggested to directly interact with an associated transcription factor (ARaTF) in breast cancer, however the functional role of ARaTF and its interaction with AR remains to be elucidated. We find that AR expression highly correlates with ARaTF in patients. To study its functional role driving tumorigenesis and metastatic outgrowth, we utilize patient-derived xenograft cell lines derived from liquid biopsies of mBC patients which reflect the highly heterogenous disease. Using genetically manipulated PDX cell models, we demonstrate that repression of ARaTF significantly reduces tumor growth of AR positive (AR+) BC cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. Notably, we observe the opposite phenotype in an AR negative cell model suggesting a tumor suppressive function when AR is not present. Mechanistically, we find that ARaTF regulates key metabolic processes: (1) Pharmacological inhibition of AR or silencing of ARaTF restricts mitochondrial respiration activity resulting in decreased energy production. (2) We also find that ARaTF positively regulates genes encoding enzymes involved in <i>de novo <\/i>fatty acid biosynthesis in AR+ BC. We further observe upregulation of the CD36 fatty acid transporter facilitating fatty acid uptake as compensatory pathway upon downregulation of ARaTF. Finally, abolishing CD36 expression in AR+ BC cells significantly reduces cell viability upon ARaTF downregulation. These findings suggest that lipid and energy metabolism are transcriptionally regulated by ARaTF facilitating cell survival in nutrient-depleted environments and thus facilitating metastatic outgrowth. These findings provide knowledge about the functional role of ARaTF regulating the lipogenic metabolic profile of AR+ breast cancer, and might help to identify patients who benefit from an anti-androgen treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-10 Steroid hormone receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Breast cancer,Metabolism,Lipid metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah-Jane Neuberth<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Corinna Schumacher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marteinn Thor Snaebjörnsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto Würth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Franziska Maria Zickgraf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ornella Kossi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felix Geist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Geist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vera Thiel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Schwickert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mattia Falcone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massimo Saini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Almut Schulze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Trumpp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin R.

Since prostate cancer cells initially require androgen signaling through the androgen receptor (AR) for proliferation, the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer involves surgical or chemical castration. While most patients respond initially, nearly all develop acquired resistance to combined androgen blockade using both first and second line agents. This resistance is often related to overexpression of AR, which is frequently driven by AR gene amplification. In some patients, this increased AR appears to render tumor cells sensitive to high dose androgens in a manner that paradoxically inhibits their growth. Bipolar Androgen Therapy (BAT) was introduced several years ago at our institution in which patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are treated intermittently with high dose testosterone. Prior clinical trials have shown that BAT can produce biochemical and objective responses, and may re-sensitize prostate cancer to subsequent second generation AR inhibitors. To define the mechanism(s) by which BAT results in tumor regression, we performed a clinical trial (NCT03554317) for patients with CRPC that included biopsies of soft tissue metastases before BAT and after 3 cycles of BAT (C4D1). Up to four tissue cores were taken per biopsy with two cores for formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) and the others snap frozen. Histologically viable tumor cells were present for both the pretreatment and C4D1 time points for 24 of the 42 enrolled patients. The FFPE samples were stained for H&#38;E and by IHC for AR, MYC and Ki67. MYC and Ki67 IHC stained slides were subjected to quantitative image analysis using HALO software (Indica Labs). Adequate frozen tumor tissue was available for laser capture microdissection and adequate amounts of RNA were obtained from 15 patients with paired pretreatment and C4D1 biopsies. RNAseq libraries were prepared using the NuGEN Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 and barcoded libraries were sequenced to an average depth of &#62; 100 million reads per sample on an Illumina NovaSeq. Gene expression values were obtained with RSEM using Star aligner with GRCh38 (human). When comparing the C4D1 samples to the pretreatment samples, there were marked decreases in tumor MYC protein levels in approximately half of the treated patients, which was associated with decreased Ki67, decreased tumor volume, and prolonged progression-free survival on BAT. Using an image analysis computed H-SCORE for MYC, there was a strong correlation between MYC protein levels and MYC mRNA using RNAseq (r=0.81, p = 2.3 x 10-7). This indicates that MYC protein levels correlate with MYC mRNA and that reductions of MYC protein by BAT are likely related to reductions of MYC mRNA in clinical metastatic tissue samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-10 Steroid hormone receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Androgen,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carolina Gomes Alexandre<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tracy Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica L.
