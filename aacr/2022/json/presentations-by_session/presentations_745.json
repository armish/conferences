[{"Abstract":"Response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) is associated with recurring mutations in tumor suppressor genes STK11 and TP53. Whereas STK11-mutated patients are mostly insensitive, TP53-mutated patients commonly respond to ICB. Previous studies have linked mutational status in these genes to differences in cell type composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, it remains unclear if differences in cell type compositions as well as cell-cell interactions in turn could account for the observed differences in treatment response and overall survival in NSCLC. Here, we perform spatial profiling of immune and stromal phenotypes in the TME of 119 NSCLC patients using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) on tissue microarrays (TMA). Matching data from MSK IMPACT (clinical sequencing) was used to establish mutation profiles and therapeutic response was included in the analysis. We find that STK11-mutated NSCLC is characterized by decreased CD4 T cell and increased neutrophil abundance, while TP53-mutated NSCLC is associated with increased CD8 T cell and decreased endothelial cell abundance. Accordingly, we stratified the patient population into TME classes by cell type composition. We found that while mutational status does not inform overall survival in our cohort, stratification by cell type abundance strongly associates with patient outcome (p-value: 0.000146, logRank test). Patients with neutrophil-rich TMEs show worse overall survival (25% 5-year survival), while patients with increased endothelial cell and macrophage abundance have a tendency to live longer (80% and 75% 5-year survival respectively). Furthermore, we interrogate pairwise proximity of immune cell types and states to construct cellular networks in NSCLC. Together, our findings suggest that TME cell type composition and cellular networks are potential molecular determinants for ICB therapeutic response in NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5617f5d1-6d46-450d-9bb3-95a2f1273156\/@z03B8ZXa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Computational Oncology,Imaging Mass Cytometry,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Florian Uhlitz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Douglas Linn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elsa Beyer Krall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacklynn Egger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hira Rizvi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Nicholson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rami Vanguri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Chow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Hellmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sohrab Shah<\/i><\/presenter>.

With an estimation incidence of 21,250 new cases diagnosed and 4,320 deaths for 2021, CLL is still considered a non-curable disease despite the wide therapeutic alternatives. CLL, like other malignant diseases, involves the activity of different cells in the microenvironment that support the leukemic cells by providing survival signals, even in presence of therapeutic agents. Among these cells, nurse-like cells (NLC) are of great importance. NLCs are M2-like macrophages known to be developed from blood monocytes, which need close contact with CLL cells for both their differentiation and their protective function. They provide multiple survival signals to CLL cells, and protect them against agents like the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. Despite their relevance, little research has been done to elucidate the program that drives NLC differentiation. Here, we addressed this question by looking at the DNA methylation signatures before and after NLC differentiation. We found that NLC differentiation produced a marked DNA hypomethylation when compared to freshly isolated monocytes, characterized by the enrichment in AP-1 transcription binding sites. AP-1 is known to be regulated by MAP kinases, so we decided to chemically inhibit these pathways and found that specific MEK inhibition lead to reduced numbers of NLCs <i>in vitro. <\/i>Further studies showed that indeed NLCs have an activated MEK signaling as seen by the basal phosphorylation of ERK<i> in vitro<\/i> by confocal microscopy. We then used the adoptive transfer E&#181;-TCL1 mice model to seek the effect of MEK inhibition <i>in vivo<\/i>. By treating the mice with trametinib, an FDA-approved MEK inhibitor, we found an increase in mouse survival when compared with the vehicle control. In addition, we observed a reduced number of monocyte\/macrophage populations, especially in those expressing EGR2, a known M2 marker, suggesting that MEK inhibition causes a disruption in CLL-supportive macrophages both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In conclusion, we observed that NLC differentiation strongly depends on the MEK signaling pathway, and that its inhibition leads to reduced myeloid supportive cells for CLL cells, followed by a reduced leukemic progression and increased CLL survival <i>in vivo<\/i>. Thus, we propose that MEK inhibition could be a potential therapeutic alternative for CLL. Further research is ongoing to determine how MEK signaling is activated during NLC differentiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b613c77-71a9-49ed-a492-8f7695b03d8c\/@z03B8ZXa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Nurse-like cells,Trametinib,epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c6deef39-b439-4f2e-b35b-0ed9f91e68c5","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c6deef39-b439-4f2e-b35b-0ed9f91e68c5\/@z03B8ZXa\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Giovanna Merchand Reyes<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramasamy Santhanam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank H.

Accumulating evidence has indicated that ccRCC arises at the site of chronic inflammation; however, how the ccRCC tumor cells interact with the immune components of the microenvironment has remained unclear. In this study we employed unbiased proteomic and genomic analyses on components of the tumor microenvironment under different conditions. We have identified the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the crosstalk between <i>VHL<\/i>-deficient kidney tubule cells and macrophages with relevance to tumor-associated inflammation and ccRCC development. We demonstrate that the <i>VHL<\/i>-deficient non-cancerous kidney epithelial cells, representing the early stage of ccRCC initiation, secrete IL-6 that recruits macrophages and induces their polarization toward the pro-tumorigenic M2 phenotype <i>in vitro<\/i> and in the mouse <i>Vhlh<\/i> gene conditional knockout model. The activated human macrophages reciprocally secrete CCL18 and TGF-beta1 to stimulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the kidney tubule cells. Importantly, treatment with anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibody can rescue inflammatory, proliferative, and EMT phenotypes of <i>Vhlh<\/i> conditional knockout <i>in vivo<\/i>. Furthermore, in a human ccRCC xenograft model, exogenous human macrophages can significantly promote primary tumor growth and metastasis; and this oncogenic function is dependent on the expression of CCL18. These findings identify specific factors involved in a reciprocal crosstalk between the tumor cells and the immune components such as macrophages in the microenvironment. These results thus suggest an avenue for early intervention of ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/457048bd-df5c-44e3-b45c-f93c600a409e\/@z03B8ZXa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-06 Inflammatory cells as regulators of tumor growth,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Inflammation,von Hippel-Lindau,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tien Hsu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thi Ngoc Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hieu-Huy Nguyen-Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chen-Yun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

The mechanisms that mediate metastatic cancer growth in the brain parenchyma are largely unknown. Melanoma, which has the highest rate of brain metastasis among common cancer types, is an ideal model to study how cancer cells adapt to the brain parenchyma. Our unbiased proteomics analysis of melanoma short-term cultures revealed that proteins implicated in neurodegenerative pathologies are differentially expressed in melanoma cells explanted from brain metastases compared to those derived from extracranial metastases. We showed that melanoma cells require amyloid beta (A&#38;#946;) for growth and survival in the brain parenchyma. Melanoma-secreted A&#38;#946; activates surrounding astrocytes to a prometastatic, anti-inflammatory phenotype and prevents phagocytosis of melanoma by microglia. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of A&#38;#946; decreases brain metastatic burden. Our results reveal a novel mechanistic connection between brain metastasis and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease - two previously unrelated pathologies, establish A&#38;#946; as a promising therapeutic target for brain metastasis, and demonstrate suppression of neuroinflammation as a critical feature of metastatic adaptation to the brain parenchyma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2372bbc8-3687-4918-9a81-67a8bd337d16\/@z03B8ZXa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Inflammation,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kevin Kleffman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Levinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Indigo V.

This poor prognosis is partly due to the aggressive nature of the disease, lack of early detection methods, its complex and dense tumor microenvironment (TME), and lack of effective treatment options. Within the PDAC TME, morphologically aberrant leaky vessels are responsible for hypoxia and impaired immune response, which likely reduces the efficacy of cancer therapies. We and others showed that pericyte coverage significantly correlates with vascular integrity\/function and intratumoral hypoxia. Therefore, understanding perivascular heterogeneity and the unique contribution of each phenotype to the TME evolution is a critical step towards personalized treatment options for PDAC.<br \/>Our study revealed that tumor-associated pericytes across all PDAC tumor tissues exhibited ectopic &#945;SMA expression up to 10X higher compared to the normal pericytes. This aberrant pericyte phenotype was correlated with vascular leakiness and hypoxia, whereas the Des<sup>+<\/sup> mature pericyte phenotype was inversely correlated with vessel leakiness. Our attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanism of pericyte phenotype switching using in vitro culture system shows that pancreatic cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (PC-Exo) is a potent inducer of &#945;SMA expression in pericyte. PC-Exo was also sufficient enough to induce &#945;SMA expression in normal pericytes within the pancreas when injected into the WT mice. In addition to the changes in pericyte markers, PC-Exo stimulated pericytes exhibited immunomodulatory phenotype with significantly higher expression of HLA-DRA, CD274, CD80, E-selectin, and P-selectin. Considering &#945;SMA is a cytoskeletal protein that can influence cellular stiffness, migration, and downstream signaling, we also examined the biomechanical properties of pericytes with altered phenotype. The results show a significant increase in pericyte stiffness and cellular height of aSMA+ pericyte. These pericytes also have elongated morphology and cytoskeletal reorganization visualized by &#945;SMA and phalloidin immunostaining. A recent study showed that acquired &#945;SMA expression converts capillary pericytes into contractile vascular smooth muscle-like cells. Blood vessels are constricted and collapsed within the PDAC TME, which may be partly caused by an abundance of &#945;SMA<sup>+<\/sup> pericytes.<br \/>In conclusion, our study indicates that tumor-associated pericytes undergo phenotype switching under the influence of pancreatic cancer cells, and these aberrant pericytes might contribute to non-optimal vascular integrity\/function. Together, our study indicates that tumor conditioned &#945;SMA<sup>+<\/sup> pericytes present mechanical abnormalities and immune-suppressive features.

One of the most prevalent sites for cancer metastasis is the lungs. According to recent research, lung stromal cells such as bronchial epithelial cells and resident macrophages secrete autotaxin (ATX), an enzyme with lysophospholipase D activity that promotes cancer progression. In fact, several studies have shown that many cell types in the lung stroma could potentially provide a rich source of ATX in diseases. In the present study, we sought to determine whether ATX derived from alveolar type II epithelial (ATII) pneumocytes could modulate the progression of lung metastasis, which has not been evaluated previously. To accomplish this, we used the B16-F10 syngeneic melanoma model, which readily metastasize to the lungs when injected intravenously. Because B16-F10 cells express high levels of ATX, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knockout (KO) ATX in B16-F10 cells, eliminating the contribution of tumor-derived ATX in lung metastasis. Next, we used the inducible Cre\/lox system (Sftpc-CreERT2\/Enpp2fl\/fl) to generate conditional KO mice in which ATX is specifically deleted in ATII cells (i.e. Sftpc-KO). Injection of ATX-KO B16-F10 cells into Sftpc-KO or Sftpc-WT control littermates allows us to investigate the specific contribution of ATII-derived ATX in lung metastasis. We found that targeted KO of ATX in ATII cells significantly reduced the metastatic burden of ATX-KO B16-F10 cells by 30% compared to Sftpc-WT mice (unpaired t-test, p=0.0283), suggesting that ATX derived from ATII cells could affect the metastatic progression. We detected upregulated levels of cytokines such as IFN&#947; (unpaired t-test, p&#60;0.0001) and TNF&#945; (unpaired t-test, p=0.0003), which could favor the increase in infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup>-T cells observed in the tumor regions of Sftpc-KO mice. Taken together, our results highlight the contribution of host ATII cells as a stromal source of ATX in the progression of melanoma lung metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6f7b5d47-7640-486e-bc20-36f19b42b64e\/@z03B8ZXa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,Lipids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melanie A.

The spatial organization of the tumor ecosystem during early-stage melanoma is not well understood. Here we integrate high-plex imaging, 3D high-resolution microscopy, and spatially-resolved micro-region transcriptomics to study immune evasion and immunoediting in primary melanoma. We collected highly multiplexed single-cell data from 70 distinct histological regions from 13 specimens (patients) selected to have multiple progression-associated histologies within a single resection. These histologies range from pre-malignant fields in which melanocytic atypia represents the first steps in cancer initiation to non-invasive (radial growth phase) and invasive (vertical growth phase) primary melanoma that eventually gives rise to disseminated disease. We find that recurrent cellular neighborhoods involving tumor, immune, and stromal cells change significantly along a progression axis involving precursor states, melanoma <i>in situ,<\/i> and primary invasive tumor. Hallmarks of immunosuppression were detectable as early as the melanoma precursor stage, and when tumors become locally invasive, a consolidated and spatially restricted environment with multiple overlapping immunosuppressive mechanisms forms along the tumor-stromal boundary. This environment is established by cytokine gradients that promote expression of MHC-II and IDO1 and by PDL1-expressing macrophages and dendritic cells engaging activated T cells. However, only a few millimeters away, T cells synapse with melanoma cells in fields of tumor regression. Thus, invasion and immunoediting can co-exist within a few millimeters of each other in a single specimen. Multiplexed single-cell imaging and micro-region mRNA profiling link morphological and molecular features of tumor evolution within and across primary cancer specimens, revealing highly localized programs of immune and tumor cell communication via paracrine cytokine signaling and direct cell-cell contact.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c875c35f-28bb-46a9-ab80-ba15d84351d0\/@A03B8ZXb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,Immunosuppression,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c66b8f53-963c-4b30-9bbf-d2efba07925e","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c66b8f53-963c-4b30-9bbf-d2efba07925e\/@A03B8ZXb\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ajit Johnson Nirmal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoltan Maliga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tuulia Vallius<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Quattrochi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alyce Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Connor Jacobson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roxanne Pelletier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clarence Yapp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raquel Arias-Camison<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-An Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Lian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George F.

This readout could be used to provide an early indication of response to anti-angiogenic drugs, thus optimizing the management of these therapies.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: Two cohorts of nude Balb\/c were inoculated with either estrogen-dependent MCF-7 (n=7) or estrogen-independent MDA-MB-231 (n=19) cells. Mice were randomly split into Control (Ctrl) and Bevacizumab (Bev,10 mg\/Kg, IP, weekly) groups. PAT was performed weekly, starting just before enrolment. Oxy- and deoxy-Hb were quantified in the tumour and reference areas. Total Hb (THb) and O<sub>2<\/sub> saturation (SO<sub>2<\/sub>) were calculated. Blood samples and tissues were collected after imaging. Hypoxia (Hypoxyprobe and CA-IX) and vascular density \/ maturity (CD31 and ASMA) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Circulating levels of human and mouse vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF and mVEGF) and Hb were measured.<br \/>Summary of New Data: Reflecting clinical observations, the MCF-7 Bev group and most of the mice from the MDA-MB-231 Bev group (8\/11) showed no improvement in survival with Bev treatment. All resistant tumours (Bev MCF-7 and Bev MDA-MB-231 non-responders (Bev-NR)) showed an increase in hVEGF production (Ctrl vs Bev; 73.0513.06 vs. 497103.9 for MCF-7; 247.984.81 vs. 330.4 85.97 for Bev NR). MDA-MB-231 responders (Bev-R) showed a significant decrease in hVEGF (247.984.81 vs. 80.53 26.13). These results indicate that VEGF was only successfully sequestered in a small subset of animals (3\/11) and that VEGF overload might be a resistance mechanism. At the final time point, PAT showed no difference between Ctrl and Bev-NR in THb for either group (THb<sup>MDA-MB-231<\/sup> 7.2&#177;1.3 vs. 5.5&#177;1.2). THb was found significantly increased in the Bev-R group by PAT (13.9&#177;3.3 p-value<sup>vs.Crtl<\/sup>=0.0339; p-value<sup>vs.Bev<\/sup>=0.0072) and biochemical measurements. SO<sub>2<\/sub> showed a slight but significant decrease between Ctrl and Bev-NR (0.58&#177;0.03 vs. 0.48&#177;0.01). A dramatic decrease was seen in the Bev-R group (0.31&#177;0.07) and significantly different from Ctrl and Bev-NR. SO<sub>2<\/sub> was sensitive to early changes, SO<sub>2 <\/sub>values increased in Ctrl and Bev-NR 48h after enrolment (p-values paired t-test p<sup>Ctrl<\/sup>= 0.0134; p<sup>NR<\/sup>=0.0268) while Bev-R shows a trend (p=0.0649). Analysis of SO2MSOT over time shows a significant (p&#60;0.0001) change in slope at 3 weeks after enrolment in the Bev-R group compared to either of the Ctrl or Bev-NR groups. Our results indicate that PAT SO<sub>2<\/sub> can differentiate responders at very early stages of the treatment. Histologically, we observed fewer blood vessels but better structured in Bev-NR than in Bev-R, which showed higher vascular density and also higher levels of hypoxia makers.<br \/>Statement of the Conclusions: Our results postulates PAT as a low-cost, label-free and non-invasive candidate to monitor response to Bevacizumab over time. Our results also indicate that tumours with functional vasculature may be resistant to Bevacizumab treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ad41e71-2233-43d9-ad78-6639b5ef353d\/@A03B8ZXb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-04 Imaging of molecular and cellular events in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,Photoacoustic,Therapy response,Oxygenation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Isabel Quiros-Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michal R.

Therefore, the spatial distribution of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T cells might represent an important surrogate for the response to cancer immunotherapy including immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy ICT. The radiolabeled minibody [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C is characterized by a high affinity to human CD8<sup> <\/sup>and was already investigated in a phase I study. Here, we present our first experience with the non invasive <i>in vivo<\/i> assessment of the whole body CD8 T cell distribution in cancer patients using<i> <\/i>clinical [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C PET\/MRI. In total 8 patients with metastasized cancers (5 x malignant melanoma; 1 x choroidal melanoma, 1 x NSCLC and 1 x sarcoma) were studied before (n = 3) or during (n = 5) ICT. Multiparametric PET\/MRI was performed 24 h after injection of 74.2&#177;17.9 MBq [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C (1.1 - 1.8 mg Df-IAB22M2C) on a Siemens Biograph mMR System (SiemensHealthineers, Erlangen, Germany). The whole body distribution of the [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C tracer was analyzed with a special focus on tumors\/metastases as well as primary and secondary lymphatic organs. The PET tracer [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C was well tolerated without any reported side effects. The PET\/MRI acquisitions 24h p.i. of [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C revealed a comparably low background signal with only a minor blood pool and unspecific tissue retention. Regarding the primary and secondary lymphoid organs we observed a high interpatient variability of the tracer uptake. Four out of five patients with previous ICT exhibited a relatively high [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C uptake in the bone marrow. Also a large number of non metastatic lymph nodes yielded a pronounced [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C uptake in four patients. Strikingly, a low [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C uptake in the spleen compared to the liver (liver\/spleen ratio &#60; 10) was observed in 4 out of the 5 patients with cancer progression during ICT. Interestingly, only one metastasis with an intense tracer was detected in this patient cohort.

Here, we use comparative RNA sequencing, outlier analysis, and spectral clustering approaches to analyze transcriptomic data of 1,543 pediatric brain tumor specimens from the UCSC Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative (Treehouse) and Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA) to identify subpopulations of pHGG patients with characteristic gene expression profiles. We find that approximately half (45%) of pHGG tumors from OpenPBTA exist in three subgroups defined by high outlier-level expression either of: mitochondrially-encoded 12S and 16S rRNAs; genes enriched in the HSF1-mediated heat shock response and activation pathways; or six C\/D box snoRNA (SNORD) genes originating from the paternally-expressed <i>SNORD116 <\/i>locus involved in Prader-Willi syndrome, a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Interestingly, the same set of HSF1-dependent pathway genes is also significantly upregulated in a subset (~11%) of pHGG tumors from Treehouse, validating this finding in two independent compendia with different transcript isolation strategies (Treehouse, polyA selection; OpenPBTA, ribodepletion). Our work identifies distinct classes of tumors with outlier-level expression of genes with previously unknown roles in pHGG and provides a framework for subtyping tumors by comparative transcriptomics that is adaptable to any cancer type. We are currently investigating the molecular roles of HSF1-response genes and the imprinted <i>SNORD116<\/i> gene cluster in pHGG. Our ongoing research into the biomolecular signatures and mechanisms of the three major tumor classes of pHGG as defined in our study will contribute to a greater understanding of pHGG disease manifestation and progression, and will inform strategies of tailored therapeutic interventions for children with this devastating disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/78bff0d1-e07f-4c18-b97b-f425e4619e11\/@A03B8ZXb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Pediatric cancers,Glioma,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gina D.

Loss of function of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) have been identified in up to 80% of MPNST cases, via recurrent genetic mutations in the core components, <i>EED<\/i> and\/or <i>SUZ12<\/i>. However, the transcriptional mis-regulation incurred by the loss of transcriptional repression in MPNST, through loss of H3K27me3, has yet to be fully deciphered. We hypothesize that PRC2 loss leads to transcriptional regulatory imbalance between key epigenetic regulating complexes in this malignancy, which may contribute to the oncogenesis of this disease. Therefore, this project aims to elucidate the role of the SWI\/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in MPNST, epigenetic regulators known to act antagonistically to PRC2.<br \/>Method: This project uses a CRISPR knock out screen combined with a single cell RNA sequencing readout to target 44 known components of the SWI\/SNF complexes. This technology enables large scale phenotypic assays, which we leverage to decipher the complicated epigenetic regulatory network within these lesions. Resulting genes of interest were further studied via loss-of-function assays coupled with colony formation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments.<br \/>Results: This CRISPR screen highlighted core SWI\/SNF components, SMARCA4 and SMARCE1, as genes of interest in MPNST. Knockdown of these genes in MPNST cell lines reduced proliferation, indicating a role for these genes in MPNST growth and viability. Further, investigations via soft agar assay found both <i>SMARCA4<\/i> and <i>SMARCE1<\/i> knock out to decrease the tumorigenic potential of MPNST cells.<br \/>The potential dependency of SMARCA4 function in MPNST cells on PRC2 mutation was investigated using a doxycycline-inducible PRC2-restoration MPNST cell line model. ChIP-seq results suggest that loss of PRC2 does not substantially affect the binding of SMARCA4-containing SWI\/SNF complexes across the genome.<br \/>DPF1, a member of the neuronal-specific SWI\/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, was further highlighted as a unique regulator of MPNST transcription via the CRISPR single-cell screen. CRISPR knockdown of this gene in MPNST cell lines has been found to decrease proliferation, while soft agar assay experiments highlighted that DPF1 loss reduces cell tumorigenicity. The unique dependency of this gene observed in MPNST but not in any other cancer subtypes highlights the potential of DPF1 to be a novel and unique therapeutic target in MPNST.<br \/>Conclusion: Thus far, our studies have shown that members of the SWI\/SNF complex play key roles in the MPNST cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. The function of these complexes in MPNST, however, may be independent of the transcriptional imbalance caused by PRC2 mutation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b370d810-8934-432b-882c-32120aca8f8c\/@A03B8ZXb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,Single cell,CRISPR,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Béga Murray<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiyuan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shahroze Abbas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hilda Jafarah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack F.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting B7-H3 (8H9 and MGA271) are well-tolerated but have demonstrated limited success in clinical trials. DS-7300a is a B7-H3 targeting ADC with a payload of DXd (an exatecan derivative that inhibits DNA topoisomerase I). DS-7300a has a drug-to-antibody ratio of 4 and it has shown promising early clinical activity in adults with advanced solid cancers (Johnson, Annals of Oncology 2021; 32:S583-S585).<br \/>Methods: Xenograft models for several pediatric cancer types were selected for preclinical testing of DS-7300a based on the high rates of B7-H3 expression in these cancers. Models were dosed at 10 mg\/kg administered intravenously every other week for two doses (Q2wk x 2). Different experimental designs were used for efficacy testing. For rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, Wilms tumor, and other pediatric solid tumors a single mouse trial (SMT) design with 40 models was used. A cohort design (N=10) was used for efficacy testing in 6 osteosarcoma models, 3 patient-derived orthotopic xenograft glioblastoma (PDOX) models, and 3 PDOX ependymoma models. For neuroblastoma models, 10 models (2 mice per model) were tested. To evaluate treatment efficacy, objective response measures based on changes in relative tumor volume were used (Houghton, Pediatr Blood Cancer 2007;49:928-940).<br \/>Results: As a single agent, DS-7300a induced a statistically significant prolongation of survival in 2 of 3 orthotopic glioblastoma and 1 of 3 ependymal tumor models. DS-7300a demonstrated high efficacy (maintained complete response, complete response, and partial response) in most non-CNS models tested: 17 of 21 rhabdomyosarcomas, 5 of 7 osteosarcomas, 7 of 10 neuroblastomas and 2 of 2 Wilms tumors. For Ewing sarcoma, most models were classified as progressive disease (9 of 15). For osteosarcoma models, the log cell kill per dose values ranged from 0.95 to 2.76 indicating high activity of the agent in these models. The activity for DS-7300a followed the general pattern of protein and RNA expression levels for B7-H3\/<i>CD276<\/i> in the models, with Ewing sarcoma models showing lower expression compared to the other models.<br \/>Conclusions: DS-7300a shows tumor-regressing anticancer activity across a wide range of pediatric solid tumor models. The maintained complete remissions observed for osteosarcoma models are noteworthy, as this level of response is uncommon for these models and as osteosarcoma shows the highest B7-H3 expression among pediatric cancers. The high level of preclinical activity observed for DS-7300a combined with the promising early clinical activity observed for adult patients provide strong rationale for studying DS-7300a in children with B7-H3 expressing solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b629a3b4-7b19-4b50-ae76-f6622bd13e8d\/@A03B8ZXb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Preclinical testing,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Richard Gorlick<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>E.

Recently, immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies targeting GD2 have improved survival rates for some patients with NB. Unfortunately, this response is not uniform across patients, which suggests an incomplete understanding of the underlying immune biology of this disease. Large-scale sequencing efforts of patient tumors have suggested that NB has diverse immune microenvironments (TMEs), which are associated with <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplification (A) and patient outcomes. While this is strong evidence, these results need to be further validated, specifically to determine whether the infiltrating immune cells can interact with tumor cells and if the TME is impacted by evolutionary pressures. We hypothesized the TME is dynamic, changing with therapy and metastasis, influenced by molecular subtype, and associated with patient outcomes.<br \/>Methods: To better understand the heterogeneity seen in NB TMEs, we obtained 93 clinically annotated tumors from 72 pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, consisting of high-risk primary and metastatic tumors both pre- and post- chemotherapy. We designed two highly multiplexed antibody panels targeting immune cells and performed either imaging mass cytometry (IMC) (<i>n <\/i>= 46) or NanoString GeoMx DSP (<i>n<\/i> = 47).<br \/>Results: We confirmed that <i>MYCN<\/i>-non amplified (NA) tumors display higher frequencies of lymphocytes<i> <\/i>including CD4 (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.003) and CD8 (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.005) T-cells. Using nearest neighbor analysis, we found that not only are both CD4 and CD8 T-cells more frequent in <i>MYCN<\/i>-NA samples, but they are significantly closer to tumor cells compared to <i>MYCN<\/i>-A tumors (<i>p<\/i> <u>&#60;<\/u> 2.2E-16), suggesting increased interactions. We then investigated the effects of exposure to chemotherapy on the TME and discovered that <i>MYCN<\/i>-NA tumors displayed higher frequencies of T-cells (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0041) and B-cells (<i>p<\/i> = 0.047) prior to exposure to chemotherapy. We also revealed increased frequencies of macrophages (<i>p<\/i> = 0.0193) and antigen presentation in tumors post-treatment. Interestingly, we saw increased expression of the immune checkpoints CTLA-4 (<i>p <\/i>= 0.0432) and TIM-3 (<i>p <\/i>= 2.05E-5), but not PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2, suggesting targeted checkpoint blockade could improve response to therapy in these patients. Notably, high expression of CD56, a marker for both NK cells and NB, was associated with increase overall survival, indicating a potential role of NK cells in improving outcomes.<br \/>Conclusions: Using two independent protein-based profiling methods, we investigated the TME in clinically annotated patient NBs. We find that the TME in NB varies with tumor subtype and changes dynamically with chemotherapy. These results can inform future trials to optimize the timing and specificity of novel immunotherapeutic approaches for these high-risk patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9e6ea536-080d-4f9e-84a3-1b534b014268\/@A03B8ZXb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-04 Pediatric cancer tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Neuroblastoma,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"47857a60-6639-4e5f-9f4c-c1d40138715a","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/47857a60-6639-4e5f-9f4c-c1d40138715a\/@A03B8ZXb\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katherine E.

Historically thought to be a phenomenon of the elderly that is associated with increased risk of HM and cardiovascular disease, CH has been observed in increasingly younger cohorts as sequencing technology has advanced. CH in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) donors has also been associated with adverse recipient outcomes.<br \/>In this retrospective analysis, we asked whether CH mutations preferentially expanded in recipients vs. donors in paired samples collected a median of 34 years post-HSCT (range 6-45). 16 donor-recipient pairs were analyzed, 11 of which had a donor sample collected pre-HSCT. All individuals were healthy at the time of contemporary sampling. Median donor age was 26 years (range 12-84) at time of HSCT. We took advantage of the ultra-low error rate (&#60;1-in-10-million) of Duplex Sequencing (DS) to comprehensively assess CH in genomic DNA from blood. We targeted 29 genes recurrently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) plus 48 kilobases of randomly chosen neutral genomic regions.<br \/>The mean DS error-corrected molecular depth across all samples was 26,731x for AML-associated genes and 32,812x in the neutral regions. CH was detected in 100% of donors and recipients, with a trend toward more CH clones in older vs. younger donors. We defined CH as mutations observed in at least 2 unique DNA molecules, rather than by a threshold variant allele frequency (VAF). Among the 11 donors with matched historical and contemporary DNA samples, CH mutations in the latter had a higher average VAF and comprised more unique mutations than in the former, reflecting clonal expansions over time. The magnitude of CH expansions was greater for the AML-associated genes than for neutral loci, consistent with positive selection.<br \/>Post-HSCT the overall number of unique mutations was similar between donors and recipients. Most donor CH variants did not preferentially expand in the recipient. A minority of recipients had a modestly increased overall average VAF relative to paired donors in AML genes. While the VAF of some likely pathogenic variants increased in the recipient vs the donor, this was not the case for most CH mutations in most recipients and the reciprocal was sometimes observed.<br \/>DS represents a powerful tool for the high-resolution study of CH evolution. In a unique historical cohort comprising longitudinal samples from some of the earliest patients and donors to undergo HSCT, we observed limited instances of accelerated CH in recipients relative to donors. While this cohort is biased due to enriched inclusion of long-term survivors, our data exemplifies how healthy hematopoiesis, indistinguishable between donors and recipients, can be maintained almost half a century following transplant.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/369dffda-5333-4f06-85ed-021a00983494\/@A03B8ZXb\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Clonal evolution,Transplant,Leukemias,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Masumi Ueda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jake Higgins<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Schmidt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fang Y.

With the automatically identified tumor and immune cells on hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) diagnostic whole slide images, we were able to map regions with lymphoid aggregates (immune hotspots - IHs) and tumor aggregates (cancer hotspots) using the Getis-Ord hotspot analysis (Getis and Ord, 1992; Nawaz et al., 2015), in 462 TCGA samples. IHs were further categorized into intratumoral (intra-IH) and peritumoral (peri-IH) based on whether they overlapped with cancer hotspots. The intra-IH score, quantifying the fraction of IHs at the cancer interface, was associated with poor overall survival independently of age, stage, and packs per year (p &#60; 0.01, Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.1 [1.3-3.2]). The increased score was coupled with upregulated transcriptional signals of B cells and T regulatory cells, and expression of B cell-related genes CXCR5, MS4A1 (CD20), CD79b.<br \/>To investigate cellular compositions of IHs, we selected 10 TRACERX patients with high intra-IH score based on H&#38;E and performed immunohistochemistry on two serial sections followed by a deep learning model to locate subpopulations of T cells (CD4+FOXP3-, CD4+FOXP3+, CD8+) and B cells (CD20+CXCR5-, CD20+CXCR5+, and CD79b+). By spatially aligning these IHC images with H&#38;E, we observed higher abundances of CD20+CXCR5+ and CD79b+ B cells at peri-IHs than intra-IHs (p&#60;0.01; p&#60;0.05), whereas none of the T cell subtypes showed a difference in localization. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) accounted for a minor proportion of peri-IHs (5.04 +- 4.38%) and intra-IHs (0.43 +- 0.61%). Furthermore, percentages of CD20+CXCR5+ B cells were significantly higher at peri-IHs than intra-IHs when TLSs were excluded (p=0.007), suggesting that the enrichment of CD20+CXCR5+ B cells at peri-IHs was not fully explained by the presence of TLSs.<br \/>To test if IHs have a role in the regulation of anti-tumor activity of T cytotoxic cells, we further measured the ratio of CD8+ to CD4+FOXP3+ T cells infiltrating into the tumor nest. The ratio at tumor regions adjacent to intra-IH was lower than the rest of the tumor nest (p&#60;0.001), suggesting a suppressive effect of intra-IH on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells.<br \/>Taken together, our results signified a protumor role of intratumoral lymphoid aggregates beyond TLSs, which may be attributed to the spatial interplay between CD8+ T cells, Tregs and B cells. Immune hotspots can serve as a prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target in lung squamous cell carcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5162167c-3a4e-4640-89c0-7853059962c4\/@A03B8ZXb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Deep learning,Immune cells,Immunohistochemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hanyun Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khalid AbdulJabbar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David A.

To date, most pre-clinical studies investigating the tumor microenvironment (TME) have utilized different spontaneous or implanted tumor lines to separately investigate immunologically cold or hot TMEs. These models are often in different mouse strains, leading to confounding variables and a disconnect as to whether the tumor or the host is contributing to the observed immunological phenotype. To account for host diversity and reduce variation on the part of the tumor, we have developed immunotherapy models using genetically heterogeneous Diversity Outbred (DO) and recombinant inbred Collaborative Cross (CC) mice. We crossed DO mice with C57BL\/6 (B6) to generate DOB6F1 mice that reliably accept B6-syngeneic B16F0 tumors after subcutaneous inoculation. DOB6F1 mice (n=142) treated with combined anti-PD1\/anti-CTLA-4 ICI on days 3, 6, and 10 after inoculation exhibited a wide variation in tumor latency, up to a maximum of 65 days, with 19 mice never developing tumor. Quantitative Trait Locus analysis revealed multiple loci influencing response to ICI. We utilized this data to challenge 12 CCB6F1 strains selected based on predicted response where ICI outcomes range from non-responsive to near complete response. In addition, we show evidence that the DOB6F1 model recreates acquired resistance to ICI, with 9 mice having an extremely delayed tumor latency (&#62;40 days). Melanin-free regions were observed in 3\/9 of these tumors, suggesting tumor editing. Acquired resistance was also noted 3\/10 ICI-treated CC051B6F1 mice. Whole transcriptomic analysis compared tumors from non-responder versus delayed latency DOB6F1 mice. Despite implantation within genetically heterogeneous mice, transcriptomic profiles from late-onset tumors cluster together. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified immune processes, with antigen processing and presentation as the most significantly dysregulated gene set. Many of the upregulated genes in late-onset tumors are driven by IFN&#947;, suggesting IFN&#947; signaling may contribute to immune escape. We tested this directly by culturing B16 cells with IFN&#947; prior to inoculation. Short exposure of B16 to IFN&#947; results in aggressive growth regardless of treatment, but long exposure increases tumor immunogenicity and responsiveness to ICI in inbred B6 mice. Experiments in ICI-responsive CT26-bearing BALB\/c mice indicate IFN&#947; signaling contributes to ICI response, as demonstrated by increased tumor burden after a single 250 &#181;g dose of neutralizing anti-IFN&#947; antibody concurrent with ICI treatment. Collectively, our DO and CC F1 models allow for reduced tumor variation with a focus on the host and associated TME, and we show differential roles of IFN&#947; in response to ICI based on the timing of IFN&#947; exposure.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f7518131-ec6e-4faf-b63a-3696009b8fb9\/@A03B8ZXb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immune response,Interferons,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justin B.

The radiotracer was incubated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines for 1h and has shown the highest uptake in HPAF-II (6.7%ID\/mg) and BxPC-3 (5.3 %ID\/mg) and MiaPaCa2 (4.75 %ID\/mg), respectively. Western blot showed a variable level of LDLR overexpression in human pancreatic cancer cells. The microPET imaging studies confirmed rapid accumulation and retention of radiotracer in the tumor (1.18 %ID\/g) and elimination through kidneys (4.5 %ID\/g) and bladder (SUV ratio of tumor to kidneys: 0.21). These results correlate with previously reported retention of the agent in Pk4a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.<br \/>Conclusions: RMX-VH has the potential to evaluate the role of LDL receptors in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We have initiated the exploratory clinical study of this agent in LDLR-overexpressing solid tumors, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d9e6ace1-9c1f-42a7-b708-ab7a842939be\/@B03B8ZXc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-08 New targets for imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Imaging,Receptors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Leo Flores II<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuewei Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cedric Malicet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pascaline Lecorche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ebrahim Delpassand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamal Temsamani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Izabela Tworowska<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Up to 80% of DIPG harbor a heterozygous point mutation that results in a lysine 27 to methionine substitution in histone variant H3.3 (H3.3K27M). However, H3.3K27M alone is insufficient for tumorigenesis in existing DIPG models, suggesting that it interacts with co-occurring oncogenic mutations. <i>NF1<\/i> deletion co-occurs with <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation and H3.3K27M in DIPG, but the impact of these mutations individually and together are understudied. To address this gap, we designed a model of DIPG based on human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) edited via CRISPR to express either wild-type or deleted <i>NF1<\/i> in conjunction with heterozygous H3.3K27M and a loss of function mutation in <i>TP53<\/i>. Edited iPSC were chemically differentiated into neural progenitor cells (iNPC), which upon implantation into the brainstems of immunodeficient mice formed diffusely invasive tumors that were histologically consistent with high-grade glioma. Mice with <i>TP53<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup>;H3.3K27M tumors survived significantly (p&#60;0.05) longer than those harboring <i>TP53<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup>;<i>NF1<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>;H3.3K27M tumors. In vitro proliferation assays of neurospheres generated from these tumors (termed iDIPG) confirmed this result, suggesting that <i>NF1 <\/i>deletion synergizes with the other two mutations to accelerate tumor growth. To determine which transcriptional pathways could be involved in this faster tumorigenesis, we performed RNA-sequencing <i>TP53<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup>;H3.3K27M (TK) and <i>TP53<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup>;<i>NF1<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>;H3.3WT (TNK) iDIPG neurospheres as well as their iNPC precursors. iDIPG and iNPC clustered by <i>NF1<\/i> status. Differential expression analysis comparing TNK and TK iDIPG neurospheres revealed 7226 differentially expressed genes (p&#60;0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis showed upregulation of transcriptional programs related to cell cycle and kinase signaling cascades in TNK iDIPG neurospheres; therefore, we focused our analysis on differentially expressed kinases to determine whether <i>NF1<\/i> deletion significantly impacts expression of the kinome. We found 141 kinases upregulated in TNK iDIPG neurospheres, including several members of the MAP kinase family and EGFR, which is amplified or activated in a large number of high-grade gliomas and therefore represents an attractive therapeutic target.<i> <\/i>Taken together, these data show that <i>NF1 <\/i>deletion is associated with a significant alteration of kinase expression in H3.3K27M iDIPG, potentially opening up a new therapeutic avenue in these devastating tumors. Further work using this model will focus on screening for kinases necessary for TNK iDIPG neurospheres survival in culture and investigating synergy between targeted kinase inhibition and HDAC inhibitors, which have shown promise in H3.3K27M DIPG.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b645059-3c91-4a4c-a3da-1ec261978873\/@B03B8ZXc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Modeling,RNA sequencing,Kinases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kasey Skinner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomoyuki Koga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunichiro Miki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert F.
