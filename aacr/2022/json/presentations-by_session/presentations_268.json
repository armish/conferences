Studies evaluating CBC risk by race\/ethnicity frequently aggregate Asian\/Pacific Islanders (API) into a single group or exclude them. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on the risk of CBC among subgroups of API breast cancer survivors.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of women ages 18+ years diagnosed with unilateral Stage I-III breast cancer using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Census Tract-level SES and Rurality Database (2000-2016). Women included in the study received cancer-directed surgery and the primary outcome of interest was asynchronous CBC occurring. SES was classified using the Yost index, a validated time-dependent composite score with the 1st quintile representing the lowest and 5th quintile being the highest SES. API women were categorized into Chinese, Japanese, Filipina, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian\/Pakistani, and other Asian\/Pacific Islanders. We determined overall associations between SES and the risk of CBC using Fine and Gray regression models accounting for competing risks comparing API women to Non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. Multivariable adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios (SHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and stratified by API subgroups.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> From a cohort of 44,362 API female breast cancer patients included, one quarter of the cohort were Filipina (25%), 18% were Chinese, 14% were Japanese, 8% were Indian\/Pakistani, and 17% were other API. API women living in the lowest SES areas were more likely to be uninsured or have Medicaid coverage (21% vs. 6%) and have Stage lll first primary breast cancer (14% vs. 10%) compared to API women living in the highest SES areas. Overall, API breast cancer patients as an aggregate group did not have significantly increased risk of CBC compared to NHW patients. In stratified subgroups, risk estimates for CBC were higher among Chinese women (SHR 1.24, 95% CI 1.08-1.41), Filipina (SHR 1.37, 95% CI 1.23-1.52), and Hawaiian women (SHR 1.67, 95% CI 1.37-2.08) when compared to NHW women after adjusting for demographics and baseline clinical characteristics. Lower SES was not associated with increased CBC risk among API women overall. However, the risk of CBC is significantly lower among Chinese and Vietnamese women and higher among Filipina women who lived in areas lower SES quintile compared to women who lived in area with the highest SES quintile when examining impact of SES within API subgroups.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Chinese, Filipina, and Hawaiian women have higher risk of CBC when compared to NHW. When disaggregated API women into subgroups, the impact of SES on the risk of CBC differs significantly across API subgroups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Race,Socioeconomic Status ,Asian\/Pacific Islanders,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hsiao- Ching Huang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenny S.

Latinas are a genetically diverse group with contributions from European, African, and Indigenous American ancestries. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified unique variants in this population, particularly at the 6q25 locus. We conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify novel genes associated with risk of breast cancer in Latinas.<br \/>Methods: We used individual level GWAS data from 2,396 Latina cases and 6,505 Latina controls from the studies in Northern California (San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study, Northern California Breast Cancer Family Registry and Kaiser Permanente Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging Cohort), Southern California (Multi-ethnic Cohort) and Mexico (CAMA study). We analyzed the association between genetically predicted whole blood (WB) gene expression and breast cancer risk using newly developed TWAS models based on 784 Mexican American individuals. We also conducted parallel analyses using breast mammary tissue (BT) TWAS models from GTEx v8. All analyses were adjusted for age, ancestry, and study. Associations with false discovery rate (FDR) probability &#60;0.05 were considered statistically significant.<br \/>Results: At FDR&#60;0.05, we identified 20 genes from BT and 39 genes from WB. Seven of the genes were significantly associated in both the WB models and GTEx BT models. Increased expression of <i>MIB2 <\/i>(p<sup>FDR<\/sup> = 4.74x10<sup>-17<\/sup> (WB) and 1.22x10<sup>-4<\/sup> (BT))<i>, NBPF26 <\/i>(p<sup>FDR<\/sup> = 1.30x10<sup>-7 <\/sup>(WB) and 7.43x10<sup>-8<\/sup> (BT))<i>, SLC35E2B <\/i>(p<sup>FDR<\/sup> = 1.12x10<sup>-4<\/sup> (WB) and 5.47x10<sup>-5<\/sup> (BT))<i>, <\/i>and<i> FAM30A <\/i>(p<sup>FDR<\/sup> = 1.18x10<sup>-10<\/sup> (WB) and 9.27x10<sup>-3<\/sup> (BT)) was associated with increased risk of breast cancer risk, whereas increased expression of <i>SLC35E2A <\/i>(p<sup>FDR<\/sup> = 8.17x10<sup>-6<\/sup> (WB) and 1.55x10<sup>-3<\/sup> (BT)) and <i>HCP5B<\/i> (p<sup>FDR<\/sup> = 1.84x10<sup>-3<\/sup> (WB) and 2.19x10<sup>-3<\/sup> (BT)) was associated with decreased breast cancer risk. Increased expression of <i>PDGFA<\/i> was associated with increased risk (p<sup>FDR<\/sup> = 1.30x10<sup>-7<\/sup>) in GTEx BT reference models but decreased risk (p<sup>FDR<\/sup> = 2.34x10<sup>-10<\/sup>) in the ancestry-specific WB model.<br \/><i> <\/i> Conclusion: Our study is the first TWAS investigating the relationship between genetically predicted gene expression and breast cancer risk in Latinas. By leveraging gene expression prediction models that capture eQTLs that are more common in populations with Indigenous American ancestry, we have identified some novel genes associated with breast cancer risk in Latinas. Of these, <i>MIB2 <\/i>is a strong candidate for a mechanistic role in breast carcinogenesis in Latinas. <i>MIB2 <\/i>is involved in Notch signaling which plays an important role in breast carcinogenesis via its mismatched receptor-ligand interaction. Our study highlights the role of ancestry-based prediction models in TWAS analyses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Latinas\/Hispanic women,Transcriptome-wide association study\/TWAS,eQTL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pooja Middha Kapoor<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angel C.

In the United States, AA men are more likely to be diagnosed with and to die of PCa compared with EA men. Changes in DNAm accompany tumor development and progression, and differences in DNAm across ancestry groups may be an important lens through which to study PCa disparities. We collected paired tumor and histologically benign formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 151 (76 AA, 75 EA) PCa patients undergoing prostatectomy at the University of Chicago. DNA was extracted and genome-wide DNAm was measured at ~850,000 CpG sites using the Illumina MethylationEpic Array. After quality control, 682,694 CpGs remained for analysis. We conducted differential methylation analyses, adjusting for batch, age, and individual and identified 29,236 and 38,035 tumor-associated CpGs in AA and EA respectively (p&#60;5x10<sup>-8<\/sup> and &#916;&#946;&#62;0.3) with 25,263 CpGs common to both sets. There was a depletion of differentially methylated CpGs in CpG islands and promoters in both groups, but depletion was stronger in AA. Tumor-associated CpGs within islands and in promoters were more likely to be hypermethylated for both groups, though this was stronger in EA. We identified 2,392 genes with differentially methylated promoters common to both ancestry groups; 223 and 1,045 were unique to AA and EA respectively. Shared gene regions included <i>GSTP1<\/i>, <i>APC<\/i>, <i>RARB<\/i>, and <i>GRASP<\/i>, which have been previously reported. We assigned CpG sites to genes and used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify differentially methylated pathways. The identified pathways include several previously associated with cancer development including the epithelial mesenchymal transition. We also identified ancestry-specific pathways including the early and late estrogen response pathways in AA. Examining the predictive ability of our differentially methylated CpGs, we found that relatively few CpGs (~10) were sufficient to distinguish tumor and benign tissue in AA and EA men (AUC&#62;0.9). Scores constructed from differentially methylated CpGs in EA were able to predict tumor vs benign in AA (and vice versa) with high accuracy. Finally, we examined the association between ancestry and DNAm in both tumor and benign tissue. Here, 89 and 423 ancestry-associated CpGs were identified in tumor and benign respectively. Overall, we find that differential methylation patterns distinguishing tumor and benign tissue are generally similar for EA and AA men. However, differenced in tumor-associated DNAm as well as the presence of ancestry-associated CpGs provide a rich area for future studies exploring the impact of these differences on cancer development in AA and EA men.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Disparities,Prostate cancer,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meytal B.

Latino ethnicity is also a risk factor for relapse. To further explore these associations, we conducted an interim analysis of risk factors for relapse in a large multi-ethnic population of children diagnosed with ALL.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: The REDIAL Consortium includes patients diagnosed with ALL at six major pediatric cancer centers in the Southwestern U.S. The study period was 2004 to 2018, and we included individuals who were 1-23 years of age when diagnosed with ALL. Time to relapse was defined as time from ALL diagnosis to the initial relapse event, with individuals censored at date of death, last follow-up, or bone marrow transplant. Demographic and clinical factors evaluated included race\/ethnicity (Latino, non-Latino Black, non-Latino White, non-Latino other), sex, age at diagnosis (1-5, 6-10, 11-15, &#62;15 years), ALL immunophenotype (B-cell, T-cell), National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk group, central nervous system involvement, enrollment on a Children&#8217;s Oncology Group clinical trial, end-induction disease failure, and end-induction bone marrow flow cytometric MRD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were further stratified based on end-induction MRD status (positive &#8805;0.01%, negative &#60;0.01%).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Overall, there were 1,710 ALL patients with a median age at diagnosis of 5 years (interquartile range: 3-11 years). The majority of patients were Latino (60.1%) and male (56.9%). Of the 379 MRD-positive patients, 74 (19.5%) relapsed, compared to 138 of 1,233 (11.2%) MRD-negative patients (p&#60;0.0001). In adjusted models, factors associated with a greater risk of relapse included MRD positivity (HR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.26-2.36), older age at diagnosis (&#62;15 vs. 1-5 years, HR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.19-3.29), and NCI high-risk group (HR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.20-2.52), while patients enrolled on a clinical trial were less likely to relapse (HR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.57-0.99). Among MRD-positive patients, Latinos were less likely to relapse (HR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.33-0.99) compared to non-Latino Whites, whereas Latinos who were MRD negative were more likely to relapse (HR=1.68, 95% CI: 1.09-2.59).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: In a large contemporary multi-ethnic cohort of &#62;1,700 children with ALL, we observed significant disparities in relapse by MRD status, age at diagnosis, NCI risk group, clinical trial enrollment, and race\/ethnicity.

The extent to which this aggressive behavior in NHB patients is driven by differences in cancer genomics is presently unknown.<br \/>We analyzed clinical and genomic data from 3,963 CRC patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering, including 336 (8%) NHB and 3,627 (92%) NHW patients. Tumors were sequenced using the clinical MSK-IMPACT test, a targeted next-generation DNA sequencing assay that identifies mutations, copy number changes and structural rearrangements in 341-505 genes using solid tissue and matched blood.<br \/>No significant differences by race were observed for stage at diagnosis or sex. While the difference in median age at diagnosis was small (53.4 for NHB vs. 55 years for NHW patients, p=0.012), significantly fewer NHB patients were diagnosed after 65 years of age (17% vs. 27%, p=0.001). Right-sided colon tumors were more common among NHB patients (37% vs. 25%, p=0.02); the proportion of rectal tumors was similar in both racial groups (31% in NHB vs. 34% in NHW patients, n.s.). Hypermutated tumors, including tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and POLE hypermutants, were more frequent among NHW patients (12% vs. 8%, p=0.02). Right-sided tumors were more frequently MSI\/hypermutated in the NHW patients (27% vs. 13%, p=0.008), whereas no differences by race were observed for left-sided colon (5% vs. 1%, n.s.) or rectal primaries (4% vs. 5%, n.s.).<br \/>Genomic analysis of the non-hypermutated tumors revealed no significant differences in tumor mutational burden or fraction of genome altered between racial groups. Tumors in NHB patients were enriched in <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations (60% vs. 45%, p&#60;0.001), but G12C mutations accounted only for 3% of all driver KRAS mutations in NHB patients vs. 8% of all driver mutations in NHW patients (p=0.01). BRAF mutations were more frequent in non-hypermutated NHW patients (7% vs. 3%, p=0.006), but the overall frequency of RTK\/RAS pathway alterations was higher in the NHB group (74% vs. 66%, p=0.004).<br \/>Even though all patients were treated at the same single institution during the study, NHB patients had shorter overall survival (OS) from the time of sequencing (median 28 months [95% CI 25-38] vs. 50 months [95% CI 47-53], p&#60;0.001). NHB patients also had worse OS [HR 1.64, CI 1.3 - 2.1, p&#60;0.001] in a multivariate analysis using Cox Proportional-Hazards and accounting for age at diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, body mass index, primary tumor location, MSI status and oncogenic alterations in <i>APC<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>SMAD4<\/i>, and <i>BRAF<\/i>.<br \/>Our data confirms that NHB patients with CRC have worse clinical outcomes than NHW patients. Clinically relevant differences in the frequency of alterations in cancer driver genes are observed based on racial origin, but they do not fully explain the difference in survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Race,African American,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Henry Walch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anisha Luthra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Walid K.

Building on our formative pilot work, in February 2021 we launched a randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of the oncology-specific COLORS training to a general LGBT healthcare cultural sensitivity training. We report here on pre- and post-assessments of this trial.<br \/>Methods: From the AMA Masterfile we obtained names and mailing addresses for 5,000 practicing oncologists that were randomly selected for equal distributions across the 9 U.S. Census Divisions. From February to May 2021, we mailed FedEx envelopes to these oncologists that included a invitation letter and information to register for the trial. Using REDCap, oncologists registered, completed a pre-training assessment, were randomized and emailed instructions on how to complete their assigned training (COLORS training or a publicly available web-based LGBT comparison training), and then completed a post-training assessment. The pre- and post-training assessments include measures for knowledge, attitudes (Modern Homonegativity Scale [MHS] and Modified Attitudes Toward LGBT Patients Scale [ATLPS-M], and practice behaviors (Gay Affirmative Practice [GAP] Scale)<br \/>Results: As of October 2021, 224 oncologists were enrolled, 201 completed the pre-training and were randomized, and 138 completed the post-training assessment. Among those randomized to COLORS, there were significant decreases from pre- to post-training (median: 24 [IQR 19-30] vs. 22.5 [16-28.5]; p&#60;0.01), indicating a shift toward more positive attitudes, and no significant difference from pre- to post-training for LGBT comparison training (median: 22.5 [IQR 16-29] vs. 22 [14-27]; p=0.98). Both trainings yielded significant (p&#60;0.01) increases from pre- to post-training for the GAP scale, indicating an increase in LGBT-affirming practice behaviors. However, the delta was higher for COLORS vs. LGBT comparison training (&#916; 4 vs. &#916; 2, respectively). Likewise, both trainings yielded significant (p&#60;0.01) improvements in knowledge from pre- to post-training. Neither training yielded trainings yielded significant differences from pre- to post-training for ATLPS-M.<br \/>Conclusion: Results from two prior single-arm trials and now this RCT demonstrate that the COLORS training is effective in improving knowledge, attitudes, and affirming clinical practices related to the care of LGBT patients. <i>This work is generously funded by the Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) Foundation and BMS Company.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,LGBT,Sexual and gender minorities,Cultural sensitivity training,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew B.

However, delivery of MTX is often interrupted by dose-limiting acute neurotoxicity, which manifests as seizures, stroke-like symptoms, or altered mental status. Because incidence and risk factors for MTX neurotoxicity are poorly defined, we evaluated clinical and demographic predictors of MTX neurotoxicity using the multi-ethnic REDIAL Consortium.<br \/>Methods: The REDIAL cohort includes pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL at six treatment centers in the southwestern U.S. This interim analysis evaluated 756 patients age 1-21 years diagnosed with B-ALL (2005-2018). Electronic health records were reviewed to determine race\/ethnicity (Latino, non-Latino White, non-Latino Black, or Other), body mass index, sex, age, and intravenous (IV) MTX dose. Applying Ponte di Legno criteria, acute MTX neurotoxicity was defined as neurologic episodes occurring &#60;21 days from intrathecal or IV MTX, which resulted in MTX treatment modifications. The proportion of patients who experienced MTX neurotoxicity and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated overall and within the induction, post-induction, and maintenance treatment phases. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the association between clinical factors and MTX neurotoxicity.<br \/>Results: The study population was 56.6% Latino, 52.8% male, 41.4% treated with &#62;5g\/m2 IV MTX, and diagnosed at a median age of 5 years. Overall, 15.5% (95% CI: 12.9-18.3%) of patients experienced neurotoxic events (n=117), including 1.9% (n=14, 95% CI: 1.0-3.1%) during induction, 13.0% (n=98, 95% CI: 10.7-15.6%) during post-induction, and 0.7% (n=5, 95% CI: 0.2-1.5%) during maintenance therapy. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant during induction or maintenance phases. Compared to non-Latinos, post-induction neurotoxicity was significantly more frequent among Latinos (aOR = 2.87, 95% CI: 1.68-5.10), with disparities observed during consolidation, interim maintenance and delayed intensification phases. Exposure to &#62;5g\/m2 IV MTX (aOR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.08-3.24) and older age at diagnosis (aOR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.08-1.24) were also associated with a significantly more post-induction neurotoxicity. No factors evaluated were significantly associated with neurotoxicity during induction and maintenance therapy.<br \/>Conclusions: MTX neurotoxicity disproportionally affects Latino children during ALL post-induction therapy. Additional work is warranted to identify risk factors for neurotoxicity during induction and maintenance therapy as well as the specific clinical and host biological factors responsible for post-induction ethnic differences in MTX neurotoxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Toxicity,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Pediatric cancers,Hispanic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Austin L.
